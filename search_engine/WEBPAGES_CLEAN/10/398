 Places to stay 
 In Kyoto, we stayed at the Hotel Granvia above the train station:
          
 I also highly recommend the nice hibachi place on one of the upper floors; the kobe beef with garlic chips and wasabi is terrific.
 
 Just for interest, here's some photos of a ryokan (traditional inn); they're not all like this, but it'll give you an impression.
              
 While you're in Kyoto, eat some yudofu, incredibly good tofu-based dinner near  nanzenji ; see e.g.  http://www.kyoto.travel/dining/yu_dofu.html 
      
 We ate at a place called Okutan, apparently.
 
   Stuff to do in / near Kyoto 
 Most of these are pretty close to one another, and can be walked between if you have an afternoon free; or just take a bus from the train station to get there directly.
    Kiyomizudera , the "Water Temple":
           
   Kinkakuji , the "Golden Pavillion Temple" (actually gold leaf, at least originally; very over the top)
           
   Ginkakuji , the "Silver Pavillion Temple" (not actually silver, but meant to reflect moonlight)
               
  Three famous zen gardens ("dry" rock gardens and moss gardens),  Ryoanji ,  Nanzenji , and Konchiin (next to Najzenji), which have all by now slightly blurred together for me:
           
 Don't forget to eat some yudofu hear nanzenji.
   Sanjusangendo, which sports 1001 individual gilded statues of Kannon
     Further away (~1-2 hrs by train? = half-day or day trips): 
  Nara, capital of Japan until maybe 800AD, home to a giant Budda, the worlds-largest wooden building (2/3 size the original, which burned down), and packs of feral attack-deer out for snacks:
               
  Himeji Castle (in Himeji), Japan's largest remaining castle and open for tours:
           
   Near Tokyo 
  Fish market (~7am)
  Kamakura
  Nikko
