 I co-founded a startup  SRCH2  to commercialize our research results on powerful search. As the CTO while on leave from UCI, I led an engineering team to develop an in-memory high-performance search engine from scratch using C++. It has the following features: 
  Full-text search 
 Instant search (prefix predicates) 
 Error correction (fuzzy search) 
 Boolean expressions 
 Faceted search 
 Stemming and stop words 
 Phrase search (e.g., “new york”) 
 Rich data types (e.g., text, int, float, and date) 
 Attribute-based search 
 Filtering (e.g., “price &lt; 20”) 
 Sorting 
 Geo search 
 User feedback ranking 
 Proximity ranking 
 Server-side highlighting 
 Query logging 
 Configurable ranking (including prefix and fuzzy predicates) 
 Real-time updates 
 Multi-threaded 
 Multiple languages 
 Chinese tokenization 
 Multiple data sources 
 RESTful API 
 Support of control messages (e.g., system status and index serialization) 
 Port-level network security 
 Token-based authorization 
 Access control (record based and attribute based) 
 Connectors to MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, with connectors for other data sources coming soon 
 SDK for programmers to write connectors for new data sources. 
  The product is  open source .
