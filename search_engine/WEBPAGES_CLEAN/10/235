  Overview, Prerequisites, and Frequently Asked Questions  

 
UCI Catalog Description: 

 
Exploration of current developments in systems and tools for creation and run-time
management of graphical user interfaces.  Object specification, constraint specification
and maintenance, control paradigms, separation of concerns, support infrastructures, and
multi-media issues are also discussed.
 

 
Themes:  UI implementation, software architectures, and composition technologies.

  </strong> </strong>    Suggested (pre-approved?) Project/Paper Topics 
   Tools for identifying, managing, and tracking event flow in apps

   Supporting cut-and-paste in a dynamic C2 architecture
(related to OLE and OpenDoc models for embedded editing)

   Supporting fast semantic feedback in C2-style architectures

   Supporting selective undo in a disributed groupware application
using C2-style architectures.  May include general mechanisms for
utilizing the command object notion of Olsen:Chapters 14-15 as the
basis for message structures.  Reformulate the C2 frameworks based on
an improved notion of message?

   A full domain-specific (?) software architecture based for editing
applications, starting from the ideas of Olsen:Chapter 12.

    Re-engineer the Endeavors UI to support undo and editing of all
three kinds of fundamental Endeavors objects, using ideas from
Olsen:Chapter 12.

    JavaBeans and Swing:  an evaluation and methodology for use
within the C2 context (connectors and C2 framework).

   A new approach to support compositional or distributed (or both)
user interfaces (may start out as a survey/issues/objectives
paper/project)
