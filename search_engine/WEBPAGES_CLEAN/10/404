 Abstract  
Constraint-based reasoning is a paradigm for formulating knowledge as a set of constraints
without specifying the method by which these constraints are to be satised. A variety
of techniques have been developed for finding partial or complete solutions for different
kinds of constraint expressions. These have been successfully applied to diverse tasks
such as design, diagnosis, truth maintenance, scheduling, spatiotemporal reasoning, logic
programming and user interface. Constraint networks are graphical representations used
to guide strategies for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
