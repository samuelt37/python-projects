 ICS 163, Spring 2006: 
Graph Algorithms 

  General Course Information 

 Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final exam. Group work on homeworks is permitted;
each student should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks.
The course texts will be  Network Flows  (Ahuja, Magnanti, and
Orlin) and  Graph Drawing  (Di Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and
Tollis). The course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30 - 1:50 in
ICF 103. 

 The final grade will be formed by combining the numerical scores from
the homeworks (20%), midterm (35%), and final (45%). 

 The TA is  Matt Johnson , with office
hours Mondays 1:00-2:00 and Wednesdays 12:00-1:00 in CS/E 338. There is also a reader,  Kebin Xu . 

 Homework solutions will be posted to the  class noteboard
on EEE .
