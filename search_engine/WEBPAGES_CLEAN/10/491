  Description and
Objectives    

 Stat 120C is the last of a three-quarter series on
introduction to probability and statistics. 

 The goal of this course is to introduce basic principles of
probability and statistical inference. Topics that will be covered include
linear regression, analysis of variance, and categorical analysis.
