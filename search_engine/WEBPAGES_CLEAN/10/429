bool seek(oefpos_t pos)
bool seek(oeoff_t offset, seek_dir dir)
    
Sets the current position of the data pointer. This is accomplished by
specifying the desired position or by specifying an offset distance and a
directionality from the current position. Directionality is specified using
the following enumeration:

  
    
enum seek_dir { beg = 0, cur = 1, end = 2 };
