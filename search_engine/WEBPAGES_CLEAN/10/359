         Day: Tuesday

       The seminar will focus on recent advances in graphical models
reasoning and knowledge representation, as well as on exploring some
application areas.  
The focus this year is on Sampling and parallel computation:   
        Sampling and its application to graphical model.
We will cover chapters from the book  Monte
Carlo Strategies in
Scientific Computing  by  J. S. Liu .  Elizabeth Thompson's tutorial  and
relevant recent papers on sampling
for
graphical models.  
          Parallelizing graphical models
algorithms .
We will delve into parallel computation principles and their potential
for exact and approximate reasoning. We will look into two frameworks. 
           The first is the parallel model used by the genetic
linkage tool of Superlink online.  
           The parallel PRAM machine developed at university of
Maryland and explore the feasibility of programming NP-complete tasks
such as constraint satisfaction and satisfiability. See  http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/vishkin/index.html 
           
          We will continue to look at applications from
bioinformatics
such as linkage analysis.   
      
Each student will be involved in presenting papers/chapters and will be
encouraged to focus on a project of interest. Students will write a
final report for their research project.    Schedule
