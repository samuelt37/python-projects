 Data Collected by the Laboratory of Automatic and Signals, University of Badji-Mokhtar Annaba, Algeria.  Direction: Prof.Mouldi Bedda Participants: H.Dahmani, C.Snani, MC.Amara Korba, S.Atoui Adapted and preprocessed by :                         Nacereddine Hammami and Mouldi Bedda                           Faculty of Engineering,                           Al-Jouf University Sakaka, Al-Jouf Kingdom of Saudi Arabia                           e-mail:  nacereddine.hammami  '@'  gmail.com   mouldi_bedda  '@'  yahoo.fr  Date: October, 2008 

   Data Set Information:  
 Dataset from 8800(10 digits x 10 repetitions x 88 speakers) time series of 13 Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) had taken from 44 males and 44 females Arabic native speakers between the ages 18 and 40 to represent ten spoken Arabic digit. 

   Attribute Information:  
 Each line on the data base represents 13 MFCCs coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame. The 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are computed with the following conditions; Sampling rate: 11025 Hz, 16 bits Window applied: hamming Filter pre-emphasized: 1-0.97Z^(-1)
