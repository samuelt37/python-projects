     Up Close - University of Melbourne 
      
         Dourish interviewed about the social life of algorithms for podcast
</strong>
          
                  
   
Informatics Professor  Paul Dourish</strong> was featured as a guest on a March 2016 episode of   Up Close  , the research talk show from the University of Melbourne, Australia. The topic of his interview—“The social life of algorithms: Shaping, and being shaped by, our world”—explains how algorithms, as more than mere technical objects, guide our social lives and organization, and are themselves evolving products of human social actions. The interview was conducted by Andi Horvath and is now available on iTunes, Stitcher and TuneIn. You can also find the full interview and its transcription on the   Up Close   website or listen to the stream below.
