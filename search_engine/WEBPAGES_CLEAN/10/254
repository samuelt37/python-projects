Abstract. It is demonstrated that the linear programming problem in d
variables and n constraints can be solved in O(n) time when d is
fixed. This bound follows from a multidimensional search technique
which is applicable for quadratic programming as well. There is also
developed an algorithm that is polynomial in both n and d provided d
is bounded by a certain slowly growing function of n.
