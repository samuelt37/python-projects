       Course Goals 
        The purpose of this course is to familiarize students
      with the theory and techniques of constraint processing, using the
      constraint network model. This model offers a natural language for
      encoding world knowledge in areas such as scheduling, vision,
      diagnosis, prediction and design, and it facilitates many computational
      tasks relevant to these domains. The course will focus on techniques
      for constraint processing. It will cover search techniques, consistency
      algorithms and structure based techniques, and will focus on properties
      that facilitate efficient solutions. Extensions will be given into
      applications such as temporal reasoning, diagnosis, scheduling, and
      probabilistic Bayes networks. The topics covered will be taken from the
      following list.

        Outline 
        The constraint network model, examples. Graph
representations, Properties of binary networks: equivalence, the
minimal and the projection networks.

global-consistency, arc and path-consistency, directional-consistency,
adaptive-consistency, relational-consistency, bucket-elimination.   
         Backtracking strategies: Look-ahead schemes:
forward-checking, variable and value orderings, constraint propagation.
The Davis-Putnam algorithms.
Look-back schemes: backjumping, constraint learning.   
         Stochastic local search algorithms: SLS, GSAT, WSAT   
         Constraint-based tractable classes: row-convexity,
tightness, looseness, implicational and functional constraints, Horn
clauses.   
         Topology-based concepts and algorithms, tree-clustering,
bucket-elimination.   
         Hybrids of search and inference; the (cycle)-cutset scheme,
