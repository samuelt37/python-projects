We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,
and partitions of those rectangles into smaller rectangles, to form
stylized visualizations of hierarchically subdivided geographic regions.
There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much
of the geographic information from the input we require the output to preserve.
