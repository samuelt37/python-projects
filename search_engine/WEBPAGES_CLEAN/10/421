3.7.1 CompareMols 
 

 
    
virtual bool CompareMols(const OEMolBase &amp;m1, OEMolBase &amp;m2) const = 0
    
This is the pure virtual function used to determine if two molecules are
conformers of the same multi-conformer molecule.  Users inheriting from
this class must define this function.  Note the molecule which is the
second argument is not const.  This allows the second molecule to be
modified as may be necessary for it to be part of a multi-conformer
molecule.  It can be assumed that every molecule from an input stream will
be used as argument m2 in this function call at least once.
