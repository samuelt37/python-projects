      WebDAV Scenarios Document Version History 

       The WebDAV scenarios document describes 
	use of distributed authoring and versioning tools to remotely
	edit Web content.  This document provides rationale and a sanity
	check for the WebDAV requirements. 

       Work on the scenarios document began in August, 1996, with
      the posting of scenarios to the discussion list.  In September,
      1996, Ora Lassila became editor of a scenarios document for
      distributed authoring and versioning scenarios, and continues to
      provide steady improvement to this document.
