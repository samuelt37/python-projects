double OERMSD(const float *ref, const float *fit, unsigned int size,
              bool overlay = false, double *rot = 0, double *trans = 0)
double OERMSD(const double *ref, const double *fit, unsigned int size,
              bool overlay = false, double *rot = 0, double *trans = 0)
    
Returns the root mean squared deviation between two sets of Cartesian
coordinates.  The two arrays passed in as ref and fit should be of length
size*3, and should contain the Cartesian coordinates of the two objects
being assesed.  The boolean flag overlay indicates whether the RMSD of the
two arrays in their current position is desired (false), or whether the
lowest possible RMSD for the two arrays should be returned (true).  If an
overlay calculation is carried out, the functions can report the rotation
and translation required to give this minimum RMSD.  An array of length nine
should be passed to the rot argument and an array of length three should be
passed as the trans argument.
