					 Karen Tanenbaum is a Project Scientist with the Department of Informatics and the Director of the Evoke Lab. Her research explores tangible and ubiquitous computing paradigms and the application of artificial intelligence techniques to interactive storytelling and game design. She also studies Maker/DIY and Steampunk cultures, with a particular emphasis on their role in STEM education and the way they function as design fictions for possible alternative relationships to technology. She is also the co-Founder of the Transformative Play Lab at UCI.
