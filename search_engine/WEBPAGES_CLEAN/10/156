 Abstract  
A well-studied problem in the electric power industry is that of optimally 
scheduling preventative maintenance of power generating units within a power plant. 
We show how these problems can be cast as constraint satisfaction problems and provide
an "iterative learning" algorithm which solves the problem in the following manner.
In order to find an optimal schedule, the algorithm solves a series of CSPs with 
successively tighter cost-bound constraints. For the solution of each problem in the series
we use constraint learning, which involves recording additional constraints that are
uncovered during search. However, instead of solving each problem independently,
after a problem is solved successfully with a certain cost-bound, the new constraints
recorded by learning are used in subsequent attempts to find a schedule with a lower
cost-bound. We show empirically that on a class of randomly generated maintenance 
scheduling problems iterative learning reduces the time to find a good schedule. We also
provide a comparative study of the most competitive CSP algorithms on the maintenance 
scheduling benchmark.
