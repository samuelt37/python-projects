We describe a new algorithm, based on
 graph matching ,
for subdividing a
 triangle mesh  (without boundary)
so that it has a
 Hamiltonian cycle  of triangles, and prove that
this subdivision process increases the total number of triangles
in the mesh by at most a factor of 3/2.  We also prove lower bounds
on the increase needed for meshes with and without boundary.
