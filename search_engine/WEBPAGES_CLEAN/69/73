      The size-limit is  12  pages for

      they will be inserted by the editor. In addition, please update your
      copyright block (at the lower left of the first page of your submission)
      to include the following information:  
      "  Permission to make digital or
      hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is
      granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for
      profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the
      full citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, or republish, to post
      on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific
      permission and/or a fee.

      Copyright 2005 ACM 1-59593-062-0/05/06 …$5.00.  "  
      We have prepared template files which include this text automatically,
      for users of LaTeX   [Click here for sig-alternate.cls]   [Click here for acm_proc_article-sp.cls]  
      and Word  [Click here for pubform.doc] . When
      using LaTeX, please make sure that the LaTeX .tex files used to not
      contain directives ( "\conferenceinfo" ,  "\CopyrightYea r",
      or  "\crdata" ) to overwrite the defaults in the style
      file   
      Please note that for government papers, a different copyright block is
      needed. For the necessary changes, please see  http://www.acm.org/sig_volunteer_info/conference_manual/6-5PROC.HTM .    Note:   Although the ACM templates include headings for
      " Categories and Subject Descriptors ", " General
      Terms ", and " Keywords " these are not used by
      PODS and can be omitted from your submitted paper.  
      Papers must be in PDF. It is essential that they print without difficulty
      on a variety of printers using  Adobe Acrobat Reader .
      Therefore, authors must be sure that any special fonts are included, etc.
      It is the absolute responsibility of the authors to ensure that their
      submitted paper is in PDF and will print easily.       
          Important Requirements about PDF Fonts    :      
        Authors should
      substitute Adobe Postscript Type 1 fonts for any bitmap fonts (e.g.,
      Postscript Type 3 bitmapped fonts, PCL fonts, MacOS bitmap fonts, Windows
      vector (outline) fonts). Bitmapped fonts display poorly on screen in PDF
      files and sometimes cause printing problems.       
        LaTEX FILES: PDFs
      generated from LaTEX files generally do not display well on screen
      because the fonts that are generated from LaTEX for the PDFs are bitmap
      images.       
        Whenever possible,
      please substitute Type 1 Postscript fonts for Type 3 fonts in LaTEX
      files, then generate PS or PDF. The following document, available on
      Adobe’s Web site, provides detailed information on substituting Adobe
      Type 1 fonts into some LaTEX papers to correct this problem. This
      information may or may not be applicable for your conference papers. See:
          http://acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/sigfaq.htm#a14    . In addition, the American
      Mathematical Society (AMS) has made a Type 1 version of the Computer
      Modern outline font freely available for download at its Web site. Go to:
          http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-fonts.html     .       
          Name your file:      
        Please use the
      following format to name your paper:    
         sub-&lt;paperID&gt;-&lt;first_author_last_name&gt;.pdf     
        For example:
      sub-428-smith.pdf (if “smith” is the last name of the first author). Use
      lower case only. DO NOT CAPITALIZE. For authors with   special
      names, please use the following rules for your file name:    
         A hyphenated last name
           remains hyphenated, e.g., Wu Yen-Tse -----&gt; yen-tse    
         A compound last name
           takes an underscore, e.g., Robert van Gulik -----&gt; van_gulik    
         Accents in last names are
           omitted, e.g., Wolfgang Schr&lt;o with umlaut&gt;der ------&gt;schroder
           (NOT schroeder); or Jean Ren&lt;e with acute&gt; ------&gt; rene
           (NOT renee)    
         Apostrophes in last names
           are replaced by an underscore e.g., Elizabeth O’Neill
           -------&gt;o_neill    
         Retain periods after
           abbreviated name elements, e.g. Melissa St. Thomas -------&gt; st._thomas    
         Drop suffixes from file
           names, e.g. Corbin Jones Jr. -------&gt; jones
