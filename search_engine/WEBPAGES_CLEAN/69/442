 Emily Navarro<body>  ICS 139W Fall 2015, Emily Navarro    (assignment adapted with permission from Deva Ramanan)          Personal Statement     For this assignment, you will prepare a personal statement, similar to one you may be required to write for application to graduate school (e.g., an MBA) or fellowship. Select one of the following questions to answer with an essay of approximately three pages:       What is your proudest achievement, and how has it impacted you?  
      What are your short-term and long-term career goals, and how will a degree from our university (or fellowship) specifically help you achieve these goals?  
      Describe a challenging experience, such as a personal or professional setback.  
      Describe a person you admire.  
      Describe a situation where your professional ethics were challenged.  
      How will other students at our university benefit from your background, experience, leadership, and/or teamwork skills?  
      What do you consider to be the single most important societal problem? Why?  
      Choose a book or books that have affected you deeply and explain why.  
         Due dates:   
• October 1—Draft for peer review in class 
• October 15—A final revision of your personal statement is due at the beginning of class. As always, all previous versions and peer reviews should be included with your paper submission. It's a good idea to re-read the   Writing Assignment Requirements   sheet before submitting each assignment.     Rubric:   
We'll use 3 categories (total of 100 points possible):     * Critical Thinking and Analysis: 34 points    The draft clearly answers one of the stated questions (the reader    should be able to easily identify which prompt was used). The draft is    written with a target audience (admissions officer, or fellowship    commitee member) in mind, emphasizing qualities of the applicant that    will make him/her a successfull addition to the target school. Beyond    just a statement of facts that answer the given prompt, the draft    includes thoughtful evaluations and assessments of such statements.    The draft addresses any possible weaknesses in an applicant's    background. Finally, the draft displays some originality that    separates it apart from most statements that an admissions officer    will encounter.         * Development and Structure: 33 points    The organization is apparent, coherent, and contributes to the overall    goals; the insightful, specific, focused development of the main    purpose/thesis is effectively organized in paragraphs; transitional    devices (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/574/1/) help to    develop one idea from the previous one or identify their logical    relations; the reader is effortlessly guided through the       chain of reasoning or progression of ideas. Parallel structure is used    to emphasize common relationships between ideas    (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/623/1/).         * Language and style: 33 points    The prose is consise, in that does not contain unncessary words or sentences.    Sentences are correct in that there no fragments    (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/1/) or dangling    modifiers (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/597/1/).    Sentences are clear with naturally flowing subordinate clauses, strong    action verbs, unambiguous pronouns, and limited use of nominalizations    and double-negatives (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/600/1/). The propose is    written with the appropriate level of formality. The prose is written    in a consistent tense (http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/601/04/)    and voice    (active vs passive).       </body>
