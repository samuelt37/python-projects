Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,
with few pairs of subsets connected by edges.
(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a
factorization does not always exist.

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.
Note, the TR, conference, and journal versions of this paper have
slightly different titles.

We use random sampling to quickly estimate, for each vertex in a graph,
the average  distance  to all other vertices.

    A steady state model for graph power laws . 
D. Eppstein and
 J. Wang .  2nd Int.
Worksh. Web Dynamics , Honolulu, 2002.  arXiv:cs.DM/0204001 .
 
We propose a random graph model that (empirically) appears to have a
power law degree distribution.  Unlike previous models, our model is
based on a Markov process rather than incremental growth.  We compare
our model with others in its ability to predict web graph clustering
behavior.
