  students through the ICS Mentor Program. Students are able to select mentors

  of the academic year, with the hope that both alumni and students will be able to  
  form long-lasting relationships.

  Alumni are always welcomed back to campus for Career Events that range from

  one of the several student groups at ICS. If you are interested in this type of  
  program, please email  alumni@ics.uci.edu .
