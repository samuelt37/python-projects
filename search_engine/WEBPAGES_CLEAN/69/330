 Deliverable 1: Prospectus<body>  Informatics 117: Project in Software System Development     Winter Quarter 2009     Prospectus   You have substantial flexibility in choosing  the specific form for the content of your deliverables. Below is a list  of items that should be included in your first deliverable, a project prospectus.  There is no need to select a manager and clerical support for this deliverable  nor  will you be doing performance appraisals at this point</strong>. Rather you should  use this opportunity to brainstorm and get to know each other.    One of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an  understanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with your  project. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing  your task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,  or changing.   In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understanding by  writing an introduction to your project that highlights its various important  aspects.    Due Date: January 20th   1. Technical Marketing Sheet Include a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technicalthan a "sales brochure") suitable for describing your product to a technicallyliterate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflectingthat you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulatehow your product will add value.  2. Project Plan Use the outline below in presenting your project plan. Note that your futuredeliverables will include updates to this plan, so treat this as a living document-- one that  you  actually get value from.  Introduction    Scope and Purpose of Document (overview)   Project Summary (short!)       Objectives      Major Activities      Management and Technical Constraints        Project Risks       Risk Analysis           Identification (what is the risk?)          Risk Estimation (how big a consequence would it have?)          Evaluation (how likely is it to occur?)           Risk Management          Risk Aversion Options (what can you do to avoid it?)         Risk Monitoring Procedures (how do you keep track of whether it is going      to occur?)           Schedule        Project Work Breakdown Structure (wikipedia is not too bad on describing      WBSs)       Time-Line Chart (when are you going to finish your various work products?)       Resource Table (how is each team member going to be applied throughout    the weeks of the project?)       (You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with parts of    this task.)        Project Estimates        Estimates (how long is each sub-task going to take?)     Historical Data     used for the Estimates (personal data? team data? application-domain data     (from other projects?))      Estimation Techniques      Project Resources       People (who is on the team?)      Hardware and software      Special resources?       Staff Organization        Team Structure (What do you expect to be the team's organizational structure?    Who reports to whom?)          Member Responsibilities (How are management and clerical tasks carried    out ? e.g., who will manage which phases and who will provide clerical    support? Have team members been assigned specific technology-area responsibilities?)      Meetings: when, where, and how often?        Tracking and Control Mechanisms        (How are you going to keep track of where you are at? How are you going    to control your deliverables? (I.e. document management, version control,    configuration control)        Appendices (if needed)    Prospectus Presentations/Reviews.  Each team must prepare a 15 minute presentation, after which we willengage in Q&amp;A. Prepare your presentation appropriately.Your presentation should describe both your technical marketing and yourproject plan.  Focus on the essential issues: the key technical goals,challenges, and risks.  Don't spend air time on the obvious.    With respect to your technical marketing plan, you can present things    such as    the problem  being solved;   important functionality your system will provide;   why the system to be developed is important;   what's the "value add" of your system;   what are the selling points of the particular system you will develop (e.g., what's different about your approach and/or chosen emphasis from otherproducts or possible approaches).   With respect to your project plan, you might consider presenting:       how you will develop it (what's your development process);      what are the risks involved;      time estimates for each task;      critical resources.      </body>
