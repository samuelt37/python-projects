These functions assign approximate 3D co-ordinates to explicit hydrogen
atoms.  For the first form of this function, that operates on an entire
molecule, only explicit hydrogen atoms with identical co-ordinates to
their parent atoms are updated.  The second form of this function only
affects the specified hydrogen atom, which should initially have the
same co-ordinates as its `parent'.
