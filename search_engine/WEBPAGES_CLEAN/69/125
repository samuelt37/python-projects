 Undergraduate Student Policies 

 
 

 Add, Drop, and Change Options 
 The Bren School strictly follows the  campus policy  for adding, dropping, and changing grade option or variable units for its courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
 However, instructors will sometimes set earlier add or drop deadlines, so it is important to read the syllabus for each class carefully at the start of the quarter. It is the  student's  responsibility to be aware of deadlines and make the modifications to his or her schedule before those deadlines pass. 
   
     »</strong>  Add, Drop, and Change Deadlines</strong> 
 Always check the course syllabus carefully for course specific add and drop information. If earlier add/drop deadliness are required by the instructor, enrollment will be controlled by the instructor with authorization codes. 
 The deadline to add or drop courses and to change grade option or variable units is  5:00pm on Friday of Week 2 . 
 Once these deadlines have passed, an  Enrollment Exception  request must be submitted through  Student Access .

    »</strong>  Submitting Enrollment Exception Requests</strong> 
 Requests to add or drop are reviewed by the academic advising office of the school offering the course, as well as the school of the student's major (if different). Requests to change grade option or variable units require the approval of the academic advising office of the student's major. 
 Enrollment exceptions for adds, drops, and change of grade option or variable units in ICS  are not guaranteed . Exception requests will only be approved for  extenuating and documented circumstances outside of the student's control . It is therefore important to continue attending class meetings and keep up with the assignments until your request is fully processed. 
 Requests will be denied if submitted for the following reasons: 
  You did notknow the deadlines 
 You did not understand the Add/Drop process 
 You did not know the grade requirements for your degree 
 The course is not required to meet Major, School, or University requirements 
 You are doing poorly in the course because of difficulties with the course material 
 You are doing poorly in the course because of a heavy course/work load 
 You are doing poorly in the course because of failure to attend 
  If your drop request is approved, please let your professor know as a courtesy once you have formally dropped the course. 
   
    » </strong> Course Conflicts</strong> 
 Time conflicts between courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis. Note that  a lecture to lecture conflict  will not</strong> be approved under  any</strong> circumstances.  If a course's lab or discussion time conflicts with another course's lecture, lab, or discussion, AND there are open spaces in both conflicting sections, follow these steps: 
  Enroll in one of the conflicting courses (if the conflict involves a lecture, be sure to enroll in the lecture). 
 Obtain written approval from both instructors to allow the conflict. 
 Forward that approval to  ucounsel@uci.edu . Be sure to provide the 5-digit course codes for the conflicting courses. 
 Allow ICS Student Affairs 2-3 business days to process the request. You will be notified by email when it has been reviewed. 
 If approved, use WebReg to enroll in the conflicting section.
