  etc.  
    Class on 26th May, will be replaced by NetSys seminar in DBH 4011 (2:00pm - 3:00pm).   

    Please submit your
              paper summaries and project proposals via the course   dropbox   in   https://eee.uci.edu/</strong>   </strong>(instead
              of sending emails)     
      
        For each paper summary
              set, you will summarize two papers in Reading Materials section. Each
              paper should be summarized in one or two pages. You can either use one
              summary (&gt;=2 pages) to summarize two papers or submit two separate
              summaries (each one &gt;=1page)

    Course
  Description:    
   
      CompSci </strong>    237 -
  Distributed Systems </strong> discusses concepts, techniques and issues
  in developing distributed systems middleware that provides high performance
  in large scale distributed and networked environments. The course will cover
  existing middleware standards and solutions such as DCE, CORBA, DCOM ,. NET,EJB,J2EE, XML, Web Services, cloud computing
  platforms and discuss their purposes, relative advantages and shortcomings.
  Issues in  designing  
   middleware  environments for special purpose needs
  (fault-tolerance,  QoS , security etc.) will also be
  discussed. 
       
   
    Motivation
  and Goals:    
   
   Advances in networking, communication, storage and
  computing technologies coupled with emerging novel application areas is
  enabling the widespread use of large scale distributed computing systems. These
  systems exhibit constant evolution as new applications place  specialized  requirements from the computing and
  communication infrastructure. Many applications provide  QoS 
  (Quality of Service) parameters that define the extent to which performance
  specifications such as responsiveness, reliability, resource utilization,
  security and cost-effectiveness may be violated. These requirements are often
  implemented via resource management mechanisms in the middleware. Distributed
  middleware enables the modular connection of software components to manage
  the resources of an open distributed system; it can be used to constrain the
  global behavior of the distributed system to ensure safety while providing
  cost-effective utilization of resources. This course will cover issues in
  developing distributed systems middleware that provides distributed
  application requirements while ensuring effective system utilization.  
   
       
    Prerequisites:    
   
   Undergraduate level course in operating systems and
  networks. A prior course of distributed systems is desirable. Working
  knowledge of Java is required.

    Grading
  Policy:</strong> 
       Homeworks     
       (30%):    3  homeworks  (weekly paper summaries),
       randomly selected each worth 10% each.      
      Midterm
       (35%) </strong>     
      Class
       Project (35%):    Includes project  proposal ,final   project demonstration and report.      
    
       
   
     Guidelines for paper summaries:</strong>  
   
     Each paper summary
       should be 1-1.5 pages of text (suggested size 10-11 pt., single spaced,
       1-inch margins)     
     Summaries should
       provide the following information about the paper in your own words:     
      The main
        contributions of paper (the key problem(s), proposed techniques and
        approaches).     
      Critique of approach,
        its advantages and its limitations.     
      Implications to
        technology practice i.e. implementation feasibility in a distributed
        computing environment.     
          
   
     Guidelines for project report:</strong>  
   
     Should be structured
       in   this format      
     5-7 pages of text
       (suggested size 10-11 pt., single spaced, 1-inch margins)     
      Should contain at
        least 10 references     
      Desirable: scope out
        the problem area and classify approaches     
         Should be submitted
       via the course   dropbox  
       in  </strong>   https://eee.uci.edu/</strong>   </strong>(instead
       of sending emails)     
        
   
     Guidelines for project slides:</strong>  
   
     Each project slides
       should not be more than 4-5 slides and it should have at least 1 slide
       for each of the following:     
      Motivation &amp;
        Goals     
      Related Work     
      System/Prototype/Simulation
        Design Specifics     
      Testing &amp;
        Evaluation Plan    
      The name of the  ppt  file should be your project group id.     
       Should be submitted
       via the course   dropbox
