" PLEIADES: An Object Management System for Software Engineering 
Environments " ,

  Abstract  

Software engineering environments impose challenging requirements on the 
design and implementation of an object management system. Existing object 
management systems have been limited in both the kinds of functionality 
they have provided and in the models of support they define. This paper 
describes a system, called PLEIADES, which provides many of the object 
management capabilities required to support software engineering
environments.
