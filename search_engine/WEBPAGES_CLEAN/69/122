A Steady State Model for Graph Power Law, by David Eppstein and Joseph Wang
 
Speaker: Joseph Wang 

 
Power law distribution seems to be an important 
characteristic of web graphs. Several existing web graph models 
generate power law graphs by adding new vertices and non-uniform 
edge connectivities to existing graphs. Researchers have 
conjectured that preferential connectivity and incremental growth 
are both required for the power law distribution. In this paper, 
we propose a different web graph model with power law distribution 
that does not require incremental growth. We also provide a 
comparison of our model with several others in their ability to 
predict web graph clustering behavior.
