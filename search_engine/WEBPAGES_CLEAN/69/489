 Memory Footprint Analysis<body>

  Memory Footprint Analysis  
      
 
     Based on a combination of analysis and profiling information, the compiler can figure out that in the previous example: 
 
  Data structure is a linked list. 
  It is going to be accessed/defined sequentially.
  It contains no cycles. 
       Using this information the compiler would generate reconfigurability instructions to
 
  Allocate the list elements in contiguous memory locations, aligned modulo the cache size.
  Configure the cache so that line size is maximized, direct mapping is used, and  cache size is maximized (or transformed into compiler-controlled on-chip memory w/o a replacement policy; in this case, compiler would generate explicit code for loading/replacing data).
