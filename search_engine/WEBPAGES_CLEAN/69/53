  Exact PR: Instances Solved vs. Cumulative Time Results 
     Note that the absence of a solver from a plot means it does not accept networks on the respective benchmarks (i.e., Bayes-only solvers do not accept Markov networks).                
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
         The overall results, for all benchmark sets. Note that this does not take into account the vastly differing number of benchmark set sizes as well as the fact that some solvers don't work on Markov networks.
