That hour will be devoted to faculty research      talks,  grad student talks (possibly including talks by students enrolled      in 229), and other activities still to be determined.                     Prerequisites        None.                    Add/Drop Policy        Determined by the School of ICS policy.                    Grades        All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade	 based upon: (a) class attendance and participation, (b) 	 presentation(s) in class,You will receive 	 one overall grade at the end of the class; no partial grades 	 will be given.                 To receive credit for the class you MUST make at least one presentation      during the quarter.
