 A Complete Anytime Algorithm for Treewidth 

 Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
In this paper, we present a Branch and Bound
algorithm called QuickBB for computing the
treewidth of an undirected graph. This algorithm
performs a search in the space of
perfect elimination ordering of vertices of the
graph. The algorithm uses novel pruning
and propagation techniques which are derived
from the theory of graph minors and
graph isomorphism. We present a new algorithm
called minor-min-width for computing
a lower bound on treewidth that is used
within the branch and bound algorithm and
which improves over earlier available lower
bounds. Empirical evaluation of QuickBB on
randomly generated graphs and benchmarks
in Graph Coloring and Bayesian Networks
shows that it is consistently better than complete
algorithms like QuickTree(Shoikhet and
Geiger) in terms of cpu time. QuickBB also
has good anytime performance, being able to
generate a better upper bound on treewidth
of some graphs whose optimal treewidth
could not be computed up to now.
