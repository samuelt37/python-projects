              Abstract   
          Best-first search can be regarded as anytime scheme
          for producing lower bounds on the optimal solution, a characteristic
          that is mostly overlooked. We explore this topic in the context of
          AND/OR best-first search, guided by the MBE heuristic, when solving
          graphical models. In that context, the impact of the secondary
          heuristic for subproblem ordering may be significant, especially in
          the anytime context. Indeed, our paper illustrates this, showing that
          the new concept of bucket errors can advise in providing effective
          subproblem orderings in AND/OR search.
