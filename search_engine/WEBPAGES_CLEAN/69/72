 ML Reading Group  
	 
		  This is an informal reading group open to all UCI students and faculty. Each week we will read and discuss an interesting paper selected by the group.  Please participate in the selection process by submitting and voting on papers in the  uciml subreddit .</strong> 
 Everyone who attends is expected to have read the paper and contribute to the discussion. Please note at least one point about the paper that you would like to discuss. This may be a question you have or an interesting idea that you would like to highlight. 
  Time:</strong> Mondays, 11am-12pm  Location:</strong> Donald Bren Hall 3011  Mailing List:</strong> mlrg at ics dot uci dot edu ( Subscribe )
