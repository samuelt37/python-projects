A Scheduling Model for 
Reduced CPU Energy
 
John Augustine
 
 
The energy usage of computer systems is becoming an important 
consideration, especially for battery operated systems. Various
methods 
for reducing energy consumption have been investigated, both at the 
circuit level and at the operating systems level. In this paper, we 
propose a simple model of job scheduling aimed at capturing some key 
aspects of energy minimization. In this model, each job is to be 
executed between its arrival time and deadline by a single processor 
with variable speed, under the assumption that energy usage per unit 
time,  P , is a convex function of the processor speed  s . 
We give an 
off-line algorithm that computes, for any set of jobs, a minimum-energy 
schedule. We then consider some on-line algorithms and their
competitive 
performance for the power function 
 P ( s ) =  s  p  , where  p  is
greater than or equal to 2. It is 
shown that one natural heuristic, called the Average Rate Heuristic, 
uses at most a constant times the minimum energy required. The
analysis 
involves bounding the largest eigenvalue in matrices of a special
type.
