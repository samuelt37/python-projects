						 Held at the Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Science and Calit2, workshop mornings were devoted to discussing a judicious mix of readings and exercises. In the afternoons, students worked in interdisciplinary teams working on projects to incorporate strong social values into information systems and technology, with guest lectures from thought leaders such as Paul Dourish, Helen Nissenbaum, and Carl DiSalvo throughout the week. The workshop closed with project presentations to a panel of academics and entrepreneurs.
