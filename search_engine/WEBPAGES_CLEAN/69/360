     I was a graduate student in Prof.  Rina
    Dechter's  group, working towards a Ph.D. in  Artificial
    Intelligence and Machine Learning  in the  School of Information
    and Computer Sciences  at  UC Irvine . I began my studies in the Fall of 2006
    and have successfully defended my dissertation in March 2013.

       Research  

     My area of concentration is probabilistic inference and
    constraint reasoning, or more generally inference in graphical
    models. The unifying theme of my research lies in exploiting
    problem structure to solve various kinds of inference tasks. The
    input is often formulated as constraint satisfaction and
    optimization problems (CSPs / WCSPs) as well as queries over
    Bayesian and Markov networks (e.g., P(e), MPE, belief
    updating). These problems are typically NP-hard. 

     I have investigated methods like variable elimination and
    belief propagation for exact and approximate reasoning, but the
    focus of my thesis work is on search methods for optimization. The
    underlying general framework of AND/OR search spaces allows
    capturing independencies as well as redundancies among
    subproblems. Over time my work on these inference methods has also
    increasingly intersected with distributed computing and
    statistical learning. 

     In particular, the main contributions of my graduate work are
    as follows: 
    
      I have studied anytime performance of AND/OR Branch and
    Bound for optimization problems. My scheme  Breadth-Rotating
    AOBB  achieves better performance with unchanged asymptotic
    complexity guarantees, yielding successively better solutions
    faster; this turns it into a viable approximation scheme while
    maintaining completeness. 

     I have developed distributed versions of our state-of-the-art
    sequential AND/OR search algorithms. The assumed parallel
    framework is very general (loosely coupled, independent worker
    nodes with minimal communication). We have empirically demonstrated
    good parallel speedup on several hundred machines. 

     I have investigated learning of statistical regression models
    for complexity prediction of the aforementioned inference
    schemes. These estimates are crucial, for instance, in achieving
    efficient load balancing in the distributed implementation. Other
    possible applications include guidance in parameter selection for
    the respective algorithms. 

      Applications are manifold, but one driving factor in our
    experimental evaluation are haplotyping and linkage problems over
    general pedigrees in human genetic analysis (under a joint NIH
    grant with computational biologists and statisticians). These
    queries can be modeled as Bayesian networks and are thus
    susceptible to our advanced inference methods. Other relevant
    problem domains include medical diagnosis, scheduling and
    planning, information theory, and image segmentation. 
    
    

      An entry based on my AND/OR Branch and Bound implementation
     placed first  in all three MPE tracks of the  PASCAL 2011
    Probabilistic Inference Challenge . A previous version of my
    solver placed third in the  UAI'10 Approximate
    Inference Challenge . Before that, I was involved in organizing
    the  UAI'08
    Probabilistic Inference Evaluation . 

     My implementation of sequential and distributed AND/OR Branch
    and Bound can be  downloaded below  (full
    source code under GPL); our research group also maintains a
    (slightly outdated) website where we make available some of the
    algorithms that were developed in the
    past:  http://graphmod.ics.uci.edu/

     Before coming to UCI I was a student at  RWTH Aachen
    University  in Aachen, Germany and  Chalmers University of
    Technology  in Gothenburg, Sweden, from which I obtained a
    M.Sc. degree in Dependable Computer Systems in 2006. 

     I maintain a (sparse) personal webpage at  www.lotten.net .

       Software  

     Available for download below is my sequential AND/OR Branch and
    Bound (AOBB) implementation called  daoopt  that solves MPE
    or similar max-product queries over Bayesian or Markov
    networks. It implements both standard depth-first AOBB and
    Breadth-Rotating AOBB as introduced in our SoCS'11 paper
    ( PDF ) for
    improved anytime performance. Both variants use the Mini Bucket
    heuristic for pruning and to guide the search. The full source
    code also includes distributed AOBB as described in my
     dissertation  .  

      Outdated: precompiled  daoopt-0.99.5a  (32 bit static Linux binary). 
       Full  source release  under GPL License. 
      The problem specification should be
    in  UAI file format , gzipped input is
    supported. Run the program with the  --help  argument to see
    a list of options, and feel free to contact me with questions. In
    general I'd be happy to hear from you if you're using the
    solver.
