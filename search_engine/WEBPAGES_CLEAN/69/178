 Abstract  
Distributed architectures and solutions are described for classes of constraint
satisfaction problems, called network consistency problems. An inherent assumption 
of these architectures is that the communication network mimics the structure
of the constraint problem. The solutions are required to be self-stabilizing and to
treat arbitrary networks, which makes them suitable for dynamic or error-prone
environments. We first show that even for relatively simple constraint networks,
such as rings, there is no self-stabilizing solution that guarantees convergence
from every initial state of the system using a completely uniform, asynchronous
model (where all processors are identical). An almost-uniform , asynchronous,
network consistency protocol with one specially designated node is shown and
proven correct. We also show that some restricted topologies such as trees can
accommodate the uniform, asynchronous model when neighboring nodes cannot
take simultaneous steps.
