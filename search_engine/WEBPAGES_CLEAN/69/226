      Welcome to the ICS Honors Program Website!  
  
   
       
  
    
   
     At the Bren School, highly ambitious, talented undergraduate students succeed in preparing themselves for complex and exciting careers. Education extends from the classroom to the laboratory, studio and library; undergraduate students have amazing opportunities to join faculty in research and have their work recognized in symposia and in print before graduating with a bachelor's degree. The ICS Honors Program, in particular, provides an opportunity for students enrolled in a Bren School major to make the most of their undergraduate career at UC Irvine.
