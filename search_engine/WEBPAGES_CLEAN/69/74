				 Abstract 
				 


				 

 The Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of plants is the biological target for a mathematical modeling of
developmental systems. The full model incorporates cell growth, proliferation and mechanical interaction,
as well as a model for the gene regulatory network (GRN). The GRN-model includes intracellular
protein interactions, and also intercellular interactions in various forms. Also transportation of proteins
between cells are allowed for. The resulting multicellular model framework is used for mimicking
expression domains of known genes in the SAM. Our simulations address the widely discussed regulatory
network of the CLAVATA1, CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL genes, which is important for controlling
the development of the SAM and thereby the complete plant. It includes interaction between genes
expressed in non-overlapping spatial regions of the SAM, requiring a model where information flows
between cells. We show the applicability of the proposed model as a helpful tool to go from current
insufficient assumptions about the interactions, to a genetic network which is able to produce gene expression
domains in-silico, agreeing with experimental data.
