 Informatics 102 Spring 2012 
   Schedule 

 

 

  There is no textbook for this course, but I may assign online readings from time to time that are germane, which will become fair game for the Midterm and Final Exam.  When readings are assigned, they will be listed here. 

 The schedule is a work in progress that will be built as we go along, depending on our progress (and, perhaps toward the end, your areas of interest).  I will try to post the lecture schedule and readings at least a week ahead of where we are in lecture, so you'll know what to expect, at least in the short term.
