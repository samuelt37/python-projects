     Class OrbitalEnergyComparator    Comparator object for Orbitals.  Ranks orbital energy. 
   Depending on how initialized, it will either rank for occupied 
  orbitals such that the maximum rated one should be the highest occupied 
  molecular orbital (HOMO). Otherwise, it will rank for unoccupied orbitals
  such that the minimum should be the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
  (LUMO). Note that this requires a special interpretation of LUMO. Sigma 
  orbitals will be ranked as having more energy than a pi orbital when 
  doing an "unoccupied" ranking.  But then, sigma and pi orbitals
  aren't even unoccupied, so what this really means, is that the 
  complementary sigma* anti-bonding orbital is higher in energy than the 
  pi* anti-bonding orbital. 
  Note that this checks the orbital bonds and neighbor atoms, so 
  explicit hydrogens must be used to avoid null reference errors.

      Initialization constructor, we must know whether to rank occupied 
      or unoccupied orbitals.
