    On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms . 
D. Eppstein.  
 SIGACT News  18 (3): 38–40, 1987 .
 
A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
 alphametic )
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

    A deterministic linear time algorithm for geometric separators
and its applications .

G.L. Miller , and 
 
S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 99–108 .   Fundamenta Informaticae  22: 309–330, 1995 
(special issue on computational geometry).
 
Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

    The crust and the beta-skeleton: combinatorial curve
reconstruction .  N. Amenta ,
 M. Bern ,
and D. Eppstein.   Graphical Models &amp; Image Processing  60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998 .
 
We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

    The distribution of cycle lengths in graphical models for iterative decoding .  X. Ge ,
D. Eppstein, and
 P. Smyth .  arXiv:cs.DM/9907002 .  Tech.
Rep. 99-10 , ICS, UCI, 1999.  IEEE Int. Symp. Information
Theory , Sorrento, Italy, 2000.  IEEE Trans. Information Theory  47 (6): 2549–2553, 2001.
 
We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.

    Tangent spheres and triangle centers . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/9909152 .   Amer. Math. Monthly  108 (1): 63–66, 2001 .
 
Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .

    Flipping cubical meshes .  M. Bern

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.  Engineering with Computers  18 (3): 173–187, 2002.
 
We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.
  
Note that the Meshing Roundtable version was by Bern and Eppstein.
Erickson was added as a co-author during the revisions for the journal version.

    The minimum expectation selection problem . 
D. Eppstein and
 G. Lueker . 
10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.  arXiv:cs.DS/0110011 .  
 Random Structures and Algorithms  21: 278–292, 2002 .
 
We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

    Algorithms for media .

Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis , Irvine, 2003.   Discrete Applied Mathematics  156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008 .
 
Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
 medium , a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

We study the problem of minimizing transitions in address signals
on a bus.  The UDRC part of the title refers to an algorithm for coding
signals with at most one transition per signal (using an increased number of
wires); we combine this with a scheme for caching previously coded addresses
and use trace data to compare our technique with previous approaches.

 maximum matching

    Comment on "Location-Scale Depth".

Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional  hyperbolic
space .  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.
  
    Cubic partial cubes from simplicial arrangements.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0510263 .   Electronic
J. Combinatorics  13(1) #R79, 2006 .
 
We show how to construct a cubic partial cube from any simplicial
arrangement of lines or pseudolines in the projective plane. As a
consequence, we find nine new infinite families of cubic partial cubes
as well as many sporadic examples.

Mathematics, Algorithms and Applications  2 (4): 553–565, 2010 .
 
The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

 E. Bozorgzadeh ,

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

Trans. Knowledge and Data Engineering  23 (2): 297–306, 2011 .
 
We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching
parts of the meshes are small.

and R. Tamstorf.   Proc. 6th Symp. Geometry Processing , Copenhagen, Denmark, 2008 .  Computer Graphics Forum   27 (5): 1477–1486 , 2008.
 
We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in  straight skeleton  construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

D. Eppstein and

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 14–25.   IEEE Transactions on Computing  60 (11): 1571–1580, 2011 .
 
Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that

general, fewer than five) trees.
  
    Densities of minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1009.5633 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  17(1), Paper R136, 2010 .
 
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
 c ( n  +  o ( n ); for instance, for
planar graphs,  c  = 3. We call  c  the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ω ω , and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams
that determine the closest two point sites to a query point, where the
distance from the query point to a pair of sites is a combination of the
individual distances to the sites and the distance from one site in the
pair to the other.
  
    Diamond-kite meshes: adaptive quadrilateral meshing and orthogonal circle packing .

Int. Meshing Roundtable), 2014 .
 
We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial

appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.
