         ICS alum Steve Trimberger Elected to National Academy of Engineering</strong>
          
                    
ICS alumnus Steve Trimberger, M.S. 1979, has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering ( NAE ) for his contributions to architectures and programming tools for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). He will be formally inducted during a ceremony at the NAE’s Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., in October. Trimberger, who was inducted into the  ICS Hall of Fame  last year, currently serves as a fellow at  Xilinx Inc.  (a provider of All Programmable FPGAs, SoCs, MPSoCs and 3D ICs) in San Jose, Calif.

  
For 2016, NAE elected 80 new members, bringing the total U.S. membership to 2,275. According to the official press release, election to the NAE is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to “engineering research, practice or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature” and to “the pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education.”
