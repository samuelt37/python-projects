 About ESL 

 
		    
		The Experiential Systems Lab (ESL) at  UC Irvine  is part of the  Department of Computer Science   within the  Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences .
		 
		  
		After primarily dealing first with data and computing and then with information and communications, computing is now entering its third major phase of evolution dealing with insights and experiences. In this phase computing is coming closer to basic needs of humans. Experiential computing is computing dealing with experiences. Traditionally, computing works with data and uses operations and abstractions closer to data. Experiential computing must use abstractions and operations to go from data all the way to experiences that are closer to normal humans. Researchers in ESL are developing approaches towards bridging the semantic gap between computers and humans to realize experiential computing.
