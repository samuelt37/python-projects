 AND/OR Search Spaces for Graphical Models 

 Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper introduces an AND/OR search space
perspective for graphical models that include
probabilistic networks (directed or undirected)
and constraint networks. In contrast to the traditional
(OR) search space view, the AND/OR
search tree displays some of the independencies
present in the graphical model explicitly and may
sometime reduce the search space exponentially.
Indeed, most algorithmic advances in searchbased
constraint processing and probabilistic inference
can be viewed as searching an AND/OR
search tree or graph. Familiar parameters such
as the depth of a spanning tree, tree-width and
path-width are shown to play a key role in characterizing
the effect of AND/OR search graphs
vs the traditional OR search graphs.
