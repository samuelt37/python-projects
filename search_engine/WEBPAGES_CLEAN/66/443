 Project:ICS samples 

 
 

Project:ICS students have proven their ability to think outside
             the box and have shown stellar work ethic in their projects. Below
            is a sampling of projects students have done.

  HP, TMR Processing  
  Students are building a simulation of a new fault tolerant computer system using
  a mechanism that can tolerate much greater variation than current systems while
  being able to survive any single failure. In this simulation, students have incorporated
  new operating system elements, new interrupt structures, new scheduling methods
  and new self-checking elements.    AOL, Program Wizard  
      Students created a program “wizard” that guides the user through
  the steps of installing and troubleshooting hardware devices.   
  HP, ServerNet  
  Students identified a mechanism to improve performance of an existing HP network
  while retaining a minimum level of service to all 16 processors in the network.   SmartHome, SmartPark  
  Students developed Web monitoring technology utilizing smart devices to make
  the Irvine “Great Park” more manageable, safe and useful to residents
  and staff. The project took in consideration the park’s actual plans,
  as well as proposed devices covering everything from light controls, audio
  electronics,
  motion detectors and wireless video cameras to moisture control devices.   
  RiverOne, RegressTest and TestGen  
  Students created .NET testing record-and-playback and .NET test data generation
  tools.
