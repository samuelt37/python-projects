class OESubSearch
    
The  OESubSearch  class performs substructure searches, also known
as subgraph isomorphism determination, on molecular graphs.  In a
molecular graph, atoms are considered nodes and bonds are edges.  The
 OESubSearch  classes is capable of performing both colored and
uncolored graph comparison.  The 'color' properties of a query graph
are stored as expression trees associated with atoms and bonds of a
query molecule.
