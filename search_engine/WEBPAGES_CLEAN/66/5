virtual void Delete() = 0
virtual bool IsDeleted() const = 0
    
The Delete function is equivalent to call OEMCMolBaseT::DeleteConf from the
parent molecule.  It removes the current conformer from the OEMCMolBaseT
containing it.  These functions do not invalidate current OEIters, and all
calls to OEMCMolBaseT::GetConfs called after the call to Delete will not
contain the deleted conformer.

  
IsDeleted is a helper function which assists other classes in maintaining
functionality after an OEConfBaseT has been deleted.
