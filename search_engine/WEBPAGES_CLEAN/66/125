OESystem::OEIterBase&lt;OEAtomBase&gt; *OEGetSubtree(const OEAtomBase *exclude,
                                               const OEAtomBase *root)
    
This function traverses the subgraph of all atoms connected to the
'root' atom passed as the second argument.  The traversal is not
allowed to cross the 'exclude' atom passed as the first argument.  An
iterator over the atoms that are members of the subgraph is returned,
including the 'root' atom.  The subgraph will include all atoms for
which there is a path to the 'root' atom which does not pass through
the 'exclude' atom.
