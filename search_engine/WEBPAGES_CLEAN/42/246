   General Information on HTML 

 Paragraphs are bounded by &amp;LT;P&amp;GT at the start and (optionally)
&amp;LT;/P&amp;GT at the end. 
 Of course, lots of folks just begin paragraphs and don't
worry about ending the previous one.  That's fine.  It works.
Part of why/how it works is that lots of things in effect
end paragraphs.  Things like lists and ``Horizontal Rules.''
Here ``Rule'' just means a straight line as one sees below.
   The general format of bounding something by &amp;LT;XXX&amp;GT at the start and
&amp;LT;/XXX&amp;GT at the end works for setting physical styles of print as well:
    XXX = B for Bold 
   XXX = I for Italic 
   XXX = TT for fixed width ``TeleTypewriter''
