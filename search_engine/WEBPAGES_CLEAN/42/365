 22 Apr 2005: 
The Maximum-Mean Subtree
 
Josiah Carlson
 
 
In this talk, we define the Maximum-Mean Subtree problem on trees, an
equivalent reformulation of the Fractional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree
Problem on Trees. We describe an algorithm that solves the Maximum-Mean
Subtree problem, and prove that our algorithm runs in O(n) time in the
worst case, improving a previous O(n log n) algorithm.
 
 
This talk is a presentation of a paper by David Eppstein and Josiah
Carlson, which was submitted to WADS 2005.
