 Taking Courses Outside of UCI  
 Continuing Bren School students may petition to take up to four approved, UC-transferable, lower-division courses—excepting writing classes—at a community college or other university. 
   
    
    »</strong>  Finding Transferable Courses</strong> 
 Consult  www.assist.org  to find courses that are UC-transferable. 
 It is extremely important to consult with a Bren School academic counselor prior to taking off-campus courses, and especially if you are near or in your last year prior to graduation. 
 A counselor will review your list of proposed courses to: 
  ensure that they will count towards your general education or major requirements 
 ensure that students do not compromise your ability to meet the   UCI residence requirement  . 
    
    »</strong>  Transferring Credit</strong> 
 Students must submit an official transcript in order to have any course taken outside of UCI applied to their degree audit.   </strong> 
 For courses taken at another 2- or 4-year institution, send official transcripts to the  Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools . 
 For courses taken through UCI Extension or Access UCI, send transcripts to the  Office of the Registrar . 
  Note : If you are a graduating senior, it is  strongly recommended  that you submit your transcripts as soon as grades are posted, and inform the appropriate the appropriate office(s) of that submission.
