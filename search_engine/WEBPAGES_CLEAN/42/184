 Solutions 

 I've written the solutions to these programs using functions, similarly to how we did in lecture on Friday, July 21.  The comments in the program are written in such a way that they assume that you've read the programs in the order that they're presented here; in other words, the comments in Version 2 of Program 2 assume that you've read the comments in both versions of Program 1 and in the first version of Program 2. 

  Program 1: Finding candidate genes on the given strand of DNA sequences
       Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user  
        Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file  
      
   Program 2: Finding candidate genes on the given and reverse strands of DNA sequences
       Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user  
        Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file  
      
   Program 3: Finding candidate genes on the given and reverse strands of DNA sequences, including the amino acid translation of each
       Version 1: Reads DNA sequences typed in by the user  
        Version 2: Reads DNA sequences from an AlexDNA file  
      
  Also, I've provided a fixed version of the AlexDNA file from Lab 4:
