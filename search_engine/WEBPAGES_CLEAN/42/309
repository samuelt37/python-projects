   The Complexity of Bendless Three-Dimensional Orthogonal Graph Drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0709.4087 .  Proc. 16th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Heraklion, Crete, 2008. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 78–89.   J. Graph Algorithms and Applications  17 (1): 35–55, 2013 .
 
Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

    Flows in one-crossing-minor-free graphs .  E. Chambers  and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1007.1484 .  Proc. 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation
(ISAAC 2010) , Jeju, Korea, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6506, 2010, pp. 241–252 .   J. Graph Algorithms
and Applications  17 (3): 201–220, 2013 .
 
We show that the maximum flow problem can be solved in near-linear time
for K 5 -minor-free and K 3,3 -minor-free graphs. The
same result also holds for H-minor-free graphs when H can be embedded in
the plane with one crossing and a structural decomposition of the input
flow graph is given.
  
    Drawing trees with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area .  C. Duncan ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 S. Kobourov , and
 M. Nöllenburg .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 183–194 .  arXiv:1009.0581 .   Discrete Comput. Geom.  49 (2): 157–182, 2013 .
 
We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.
  
    Optimal 3D angular resolution for low-degree graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. Löffler ,
E. Mumford, and
 M. Nöllenburg .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 208–219 .  arXiv:1009.0045 .   J. Graph Algorithms
and Applications  17 (3): 173–200, 2013 .
 
We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.
  
    Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the
bounded faces have small dimension . 
D. Eppstein and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 27th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Paris, 2011, pp. 361–368.  arXiv:1103.2575 .   Discrete Comput. Geom.  50 (1): 1–21, 2013 .
 
Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .
    On 2-site Voronoi diagrams under geometric distance functions .  G. Barequet ,
 M. Dickerson ,
D. Eppstein,
D. Hodorkovsky, and
K. Vyatkina.   27th Eur. Worksh. Comp. Geom. , Antoniushaus Morschach,
Switzerland, 2011, pp. 59–62 .   Proc. 8th Int. Symp. Voronoi Diagrams in Science and
Engineering , Qing Dao, China, 2011, pp. 31–38 .  arXiv:1105.4130 .   J. Computer Science and Technology  28 (2): 267–277, 2013 .
 
We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams
that determine the closest two point sites to a query point, where the
distance from the query point to a pair of sites is a combination of the
individual distances to the sites and the distance from one site in the
pair to the other.
  
    Category-based routing in social networks: membership dimension and the small-world phenomenon . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 M. Löffler ,
 D. Strash , and
 L. Trott .  Workshop on Graph Algorithms and Applications , Zürich,
Switzerland, July 2011.  International Conference on Computational
Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN 2011) , Salamanca, Spain, October
2011.  arXiv:1108.4675 .   Theor. Comput. Sci.  514: 96–104, 2013 . (Special issue on Graph
Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)  
We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.
  
    Confluent Hasse diagrams . 
D. Eppstein and
 J. Simons .  Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 2–13.  arXiv:1108.5361 .   J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications  17 (7): 689–710, 2013 .
 
We show that a partial order has a non-crossing upward planar drawing if
and only if it has order dimension two, and we use the
Dedekind-MacNeille completion to find a drawing with the minimum
possible number of confluent junctions.
  
    Improved grid map layout by point set matching . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. van Kreveld ,
 B. Speckmann , and
 F. Staals .  28th European Workshop on Computational Geometry (EuroCG'12) , Assisi,
Italy, 2012.  6th IEEE Pacific Visualization Conf. (PacificVis) , Sydney, Australia, 2013.   Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl.  25 (2): 101–122, 2015 .
 
We study the problem of matching geographic regions to points in a
regular grid, minimizing the distance between each region's centroid and
the corresponding grid point, and preserving as much as possible the
relative orientations between pairs of regions.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1206.6142 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 126–137 .  
We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

    Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 L. Trott .  arXiv:1209.0748 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 414–425 .  
We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.
  
    On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs .  F. J. Brandenburg ,
D. Eppstein,
A. Gleißner,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
K. Hanauer, and
J. Reislhuber.  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 327–338 .  
A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.
  
    Windows into relational events: data structures for contiguous
subsequences of edges .  M. J. Bannister ,
 C. DuBois ,
D. Eppstein, and
 P. Smyth .  NIPS 2012 Workshop on Algorithmic and Statistical Approaches for Large
Social Networks , South Lake Tahoe, California, 2012 (poster and invited talk).   24th ACM-SIAM
Symp. Discrete Algorithms , New Orleans, Louisiana, 2013,
pp. 856–864.   arXiv:1209.5791 .
 
We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a
social network have a sequence of pairwise interactions. Contiguous
subsequences of these interactions form graphs, and we develop efficient
data structures for querying the parameters of these graphs.
  
    The graphs of planar soap bubbles . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1207.3761 .   Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36 .
 
We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar lombardi drawing. ".

    Antimatroids and balanced pairs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1302.5967 .   Order  31 (1): 81–99, 2014 .
 Erratum (with V. Wiechert) .
 
We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial
order should have a pair of items that are nearly equally likely to
appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.
  
    Grid minors in damaged grids . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1303.1136 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  21(3), Paper P3.20, 2014 .
 
We give tight bounds on the size of the largest remaining grid minor in
a grid graph from which a given number of vertices have been deleted,
and study several related problems.
  
    Combinatorial pair testing: distinguishing workers from slackers . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
and  D. S. Hirschberg .  arXiv:1305.0110 . 
13th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2013), London, Ontario.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8037 , 2013, pp. 316–327 .  
We study the problem of distinguishing workers (people who complete
their assigned tasks) from slackers (people who do not contribute
towards the completion of their tasks) by grouping people in pairs and
assigning a task to each group.
  
    Parameterized complexity of 1-planarity .  M. J. Bannister ,
 S. Cabello ,
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1304.5591 . 
13th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2013), London, Ontario  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8037 , 2013, pp. 97–108 .  
We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

In  Knowledge Spaces: Applications in Education ,
J.-C. Falmagne, D. Albert, C. Doble, D. Eppstein, and X. Hu, eds.  Springer, 2013, pp. 287–304 .
 
We show how to represent a learning space by a small family of learning
sequences, orderings of the items in a learning sequence that are
consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge
states and the efficient assessment of the state of knowledge of a human
learner.

In another chapter of the same book we used learning sequences to
represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of
a human learning. In this chapter we show how to use the same data
structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger
learning space (an important subroutine in knowledge assessment) and to
modify a learning space to more accurately model students.

    Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein, and
 J. Simons .  arXiv:1308.5741 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 340–351 .  
Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.   J. Graph Algorithms &amp; Applications  18 (2): 177–209, 2014   (special issue for GD'13).
 
A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.
  
   Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0066 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 436–447 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.
  
    Strict confluent drawing . 
D. Eppstein,
 D. Holten ,
 M. Löffler ,
 M. Nöllenburg , and
 B. Speckmann , and
 K. Verbeek .  arXiv:1308.6824 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 352–363 .   J. Computational Geometry  7 (1): 22–46, 2016 .
 
A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.
  
    Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines . 
D. Eppstein,
M. van Garderen,
 B. Speckmann , and
 T. Ueckerdt .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing  (poster), Bordeaux, France, 2013. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.
  
    Small superpatterns for dominance drawing .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103  .
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.
