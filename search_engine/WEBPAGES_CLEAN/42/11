         Fowlkes awarded $377K NSF grant for geometric imaging research
</strong>
          
                    
Associate Professor of Computer Science   Charles Fowlkes </strong> has received a $377,407 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant in support of his project, “RI: Small: Building Strong Geometric Priors for Total Scene Understanding.” The grant period is set to run between July 2016 and June 2019.

  
Understanding geometric imaging can change the way professionals approach the problem of impulsively interpreting the semantic content of individual photos or videos. Fowlkes will research data sets and algorithms to significantly improve the ability of computer vision systems to understand image content. The  project  involves UC Irvine students in research from a range of traditional disciplines to engage a wider audience in understanding and applying these technologies for new scientific and social purposes.
