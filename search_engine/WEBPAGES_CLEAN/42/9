        Advancing AND/OR Search for Optimization Using Diverse Principles.    
        Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   

In recent years, several Branch-and-Bound and best-first search algorithms
were developed to explore the AND/OR search graph for solving general
constraint optimization problems. Previous work showed the tremendous gain obtained
by exploiting problem's decomposition (using AND nodes), equivalence
(by caching) and irrelevance (via the power of lower bound heuristics). In this paper,
we show the additional improvements that can be gained by bringing together
all the above, as well as diverse refinements and optimizing principles such as exploiting
determinism via constraint propagation, using good initial upper bounds
generated via stochastic local search and improving the quality of the guiding
pseudo tree. We illustrate our results using a number of benchmark networks,
including the very challenging ones that arise in genetic linkage analysis.
