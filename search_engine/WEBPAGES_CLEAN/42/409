    Course Description
  and Prerequisites    
       
    131 Social Analysis
  of Computerization (4).  Introduction of computerization as a social
  process. Examines the social opportunities and problems raised by new
  information technologies, and the consequences of different ways of
  organizing. Topics include computerization and work life, privacy, virtual
  communities, productivity paradox, systems risks. Prerequisites: one course
  (with a grade of C or better) selected from ICS 1A, Engineering 10,
  Engineering ECE11, ICS 21, or equivalent; upper-division standing;
  satisfactory completion of the lower-division writing requirement. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Policies    
       
    Add/drop:  More
  students wish to add this class than we have the capacity to accommodate.
  Those wishing to add must fill out an enrollment request at the first class
  meeting; Following departmental and university guidelines, we will establish
  priorities for filling any seats that become available. 
       
   Because a student who is enrolled occupies a seat that
  other students want, ICS does not allow students to drop after it's too late for
  another student to fill that seat. Although this deadline is normally  the
  end of week 2 , due to a scheduling conflict, you must  decide by the
  beginning of week 2  if you wish to drop the class.  Specifically, if you wish to drop the class, you must do so at the
  end of class on October 6 or sooner.  
       
    Academic honest:  Please
  familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy:  http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm .
  The consequences of academic dishonesty are not worth the risks. 
       
    Missed quizzes:  There
  are no  makeup�s  for missed quizzes, but as you see
  below, one quiz is approximately only 2% of your total grade. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Course Mechanics and
  Grading    
       
    Grading (Items
  Explained Below)    
       
   Short summaries: 25% 
   Long summaries: 30% 
   Class participation: 5% 
   Quizzes: 20% (approximately 10) 
   Midterm: 10% 
   Final: 10% 
       
    Basis of
  Lecture/Course Materials:  Each week there will be 2-3 articles identified
  and some or all will be discussed in class on Mondays. Many of the articles
  will be available electronically. Those that are not will be distributed
  through the EngineeringCopyCenter. See Schedule, Lecture,
  &amp; Assignments. 
       
    Short Summaries: 
  You will write an original, half-page reaction to each article. The reaction
  will have two paragraphs. The first will take a few sentences to summarize
  the article / issue. The second paragraph will summarize your reaction /
  opinion. Short summaries will be turned in with the long summaries. 
       
    Long Summaries:  After
  the conclusion of each major topic, spanning one or more weeks of class, you
  will have one week to write a four-page, double-spaced (1.25� margins, Times
  style font size 12 or Arial/Tahoma style font size 10). You will summarize
  information in different articles about the major topic. You will use
  articles provided in class but you will also find 3 additional sources
  related to the topic. Three pages must be all text. The fourth page would be
  a reference section identifying citations to the 3 additional sources but may
  contain some extra text. 
       
    In-class
  Discussion:  Normally, each lecture will consist of discussion of the
  topic for that week. However, Wednesdays will be devoted to a structured
  discussion in which students are called upon randomly to make a brief
  statement based on the readings. 
       
    Quizzes:  Friday
  lectures will normally begin by continuing the discussion of the week�s topic
  and conclude with a one-question quiz. 
       
    Midterms and
  Finals:  There will be both a midterm exam and a final, with some lecture
  time devoted to review. 
       
    Notebooks:  For
  your own organization, you should keep a notebook that contains readings,
  related clippings, short summaries, long summaries, exams. This is especially
  important if you need later to dispute a missing grade for an assignment. 
       
    Announcements:  Please
  check the announcements link of the class Web page regularly. Emergency
  announcements will be made using the official mailing list, so make sure your
  UCI (name@uci.edu) login is functioning and that you check it daily.
