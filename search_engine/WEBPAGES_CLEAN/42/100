 Paying for Graduate School 

 
 

 The Bren School has been able to support Ph.D. students admitted into the program in the past.  
  A breakdown of 
tuition and costs for attending UC Irvine , can be viewed at the 
Office of the Registrar web site.  
 While the School does not guarantee support for 100% of our students in the future, we continue to search for funding sources for all Ph.D. graduate students.  
 M.S. students may have the opportunity to work with local companies through part-time internships and apply for teaching assistant positions. 
 International students should not expect to be funded unless they are officially notified in writing.  
 The University of California, Irvine requires international students to pass an  English Proficiency Exam  before they can be appointed as a Teaching Assistant (TA). 
 If an international student is offered a teaching asistantship and has not taken one of these exams, they should plan to do so as soon as possible. For further information regarding international students, please visit the  International Center website .

Graduate Program is your application for Bren School Fellowships. If 
awarded a fellowship, you will receive notification along with your 
admission offer.
