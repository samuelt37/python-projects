 10 points. 
Use Kuratowski's Theorem to 
prove that the following graph, called Petersen's graph, is
nonplanar.
 
  
  

  
 10 points. 
Show how to draw each of the following graphs 
on the surface of a torus (i.e., a "donut" with a hole in the middle) 
so that no two two edges cross.
  
 K  5   
 K  3,3     
 10 points. 
Draw a biconnected planar graph  G  
with 10 vertices that has a separating cycle  C  with 6 vertices
such that there are 5 pieces with respect to  C  that induce an
interlacement graph with 6 edges.

  
 10 points. 
Give an example of a biconnected graph  G  and a separating cycle
 C  in  G  such that the interlacement graph for the pieces of 
 G  with respect to  C  has 
at least  cn  2  edges, for some constant  c  &gt; 0.

  
 10 points. 
Let  P  be a piece of a biconnected graph with respect to a
cycle  C :
   Show that if  P 
has at least one vertex, the number of edges of  P  is great
than or equal to the number of attachments of  P .
   Show that the graph obtained by adding  P  to  C  is
biconnected.
