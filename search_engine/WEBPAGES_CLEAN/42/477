   Interconnect criticality driven delay relaxation.   L. Singhal ,

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.
