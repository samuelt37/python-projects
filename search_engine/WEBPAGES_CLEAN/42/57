 Abstract  
Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) involve finding
values for problem variables that satisfy restrictions on
which combinations of values are allowed [Freuder and
Mackworth, 1994; Tsang, 1993]. They have many applications, 
including planning and scheduling, design and
configuration, vision and language, temporal and spatial
reasoning. The map coloring problem is a simple example, 
where the problem variables correspond to countries, 
the values to colors, and the constraints specify
that neighboring countries cannot have the same color.
