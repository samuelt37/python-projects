            Combinatorial Inference and Learning for Fusing Recognition and Perceptual Grouping 
         
        The overarching goal of this NSF funded project ( IIS-1253538 ) 
        is to develop integrated models for fusing recognition and perceptual grouping. 

        When presented with a novel image, humans typically have little problem
        providing a consistent interpretation of the scene in terms of
        contours, surfaces, junctions, and the relations between them. This
        process of perceptual organization is closely coupled with recognition
        of familiar shapes and materials. Perceptual organization can aid
        recognition by reducing the complexity of a cluttered scene to a small
        number of candidate surfaces while recognition can help resolve
        ambiguities in grouping based on local image cues. This project is
        developing a computational framework that fuses top-down information
        provided by recognition with bottom-up perceptual organization in order
        to automatically produce a coherent scene interpretation. This research
        includes (1) identifying local image features that provide cues to
        grouping and figure-ground, (2) developing libraries of composable
        detectors that capture the appearance of objects, parts and their
        spatial relations, and (3) designing models and efficient inference
        routines that explicitly reason about occlusion and the binding of
        image regions and contours into object shapes.  

        Integrated models of grouping and recognition have direct significance
        to expand the computer vision capabilities of robotics and assistive
        technologies that must operate in complex, cluttered environments. The
        framework being developed also has applications in automating
        biological image analysis where top-down shape information are useful
        in resolving noisy local measurements.
