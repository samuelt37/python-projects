   Course Description 

   One of the main challenges in building intelligent systems
  is the ability to reason under uncertainty, and one of the most successful
  approaches for dealing with this challenge is based on the framework of
  Bayesian networks, also called graphical models. Intelligent systems based on
  Bayesian networks are being used in a variety of real-world applications
  including diagnosis, sensor fusion, on-line help systems, credit assessment,
  bioinformatics and data mining.

    The objective of this class is to provide an in-depth exposition of
  knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty using the framework
  of Bayesian networks.  Both theoretical underpinnings and practical
  considerations will be covered, with a special emphasis on dependency and
  independency models, on construction Bayesian graphical models and on exact
  and approximate probabilistic reasoning algorithms. Additional topics
  include: causal networks, learning Bayesian network parameters from data and
  dynamic Bayesian networks.
    


    
   Prerequisites 
   
    Familiarity with basic concepts of probability theory.  
    Knowledge of basic computer science, algorithms and programming principles.  
    Previous exposure to AI is desirable but not essential.
