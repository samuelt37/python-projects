This is a small, simple to use tool for sending anonymous email to me. 
Please feel free to use it any time that you want to communicate with 
me anonymously.
 
Do  NOT ask questions  via anonymous email: I don't know who to 
reply to (and I don't want to broadcast a reply to the entire class).
  
Depending on the content, I might forward this note to the class 
discussion email list, with my reply.
