Teamware is the main program for running the Teamware Process
Support System.  This system is designed to improve team coordination
and managerial control of software development teams.  Teamware allows   
users to explicitly define their software development processes and 
provides extensive execution support.  In addition, Teamware is designed
for non-technical as well as technical users, and appropriate for use by
manager, process programmers, system programmers, domain experts, and
end-users (including WWW process guidance support).  The Teamware 
system is made up of three architectural components, the User, 
System, and Foundation levels.
