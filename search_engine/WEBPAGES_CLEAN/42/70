                Bouncer: 
            Admission Control Toolkit    
         
       
                             
         
         
              We have implemented Bouncer, a general-purpose 
            toolkit for admission control.  All cryptographic functions 
            are developed using the    OpenSSL    and 
             MIRACL  libraries. The toolkit is written in C on 
            Linux 2.4 and currently consists of about 65,000 lines of codes.

              The Bouncer toolkit is composed of three basic 
            layers of the architecture; Bouncer APIs, security and management services, 
            and the underlying cryptographic functions.  
         
       
                             
                 
         
         
               
               
               
         
       
                             
         
         
               The 
            Bouncer APIs define the application programming interface for accessing 
            the admission control services. These APIs are useful when integrating 
            our Bouncer with other peer group applications. The security and 
            management services are carried out by the following modules:  
                 
                 - 
            Policy Management Module  
                 - 
            Certificate Handling Module  
                 - 
            Data Encoding Module  
                 - 
            Protocol Handling Module  
              All security services are provided by the 
            underlying cryptographic libraries. Most of the general cryptographic 
            functions such as SHA-1, RSA, DSA, and so on, are supported by OpenSSL. 
            Specifically, we have implemented three distributed cryptographic 
            schemes on top of OpenSSL and MIRACL libraries, and embedded our libraries into it. The 
            Bouncer supports five  different threshold schemes; three for long-lived 
            DPGs and two for short-lived DPGs.
