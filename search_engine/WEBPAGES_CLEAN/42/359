  Comparison of coding methods 
  (Maguire, 1987)  
   
    
         Coding method   
     
       Maximum number 
      of codes   
       Comments   
      Alphanumerics  
      Unlimited  
      Highly versatile. 
      Meaning can be self-evident. Location time may be longer than for graphic 
      code.  
      Shapes  
      10-20  
      Very effective if 
      code matches object or operation represented  
      Color  
      4-11  
      Attractive and efficient. 
      Excessive use confusing. Limited value for the color-blind.  
      Line angle  
      8-11  
      Good in special 
      cases, for example, wind direction.  
      Line length  
      3-4  
      Good. Can clutter 
      display if many codes displayed.  
      Line width  
      2-3  
      Good  
      Line style  
      5-9  
      Good  
      Object size  
      3-5  
      Fair. Can take up 
      considerable space. Location time longer than for shape and color  
      Brightness  
      2-4  
      Can be fatiguing, 
      especially if screen contrast is poor  
      Blink  
      2-4  
      Good for getting 
      attention but should be suppressible afterwards. Annoying if overused. Limit 
      to small fields.  
      Reverse video  
      No data  
      Effective for making 
      data stand out. If large area is in reverse video, flicker is more easily 
      perceived.  
      Underlining  
      No data  
      Useful but can reduce 
      text legibility.  
      Combination of codes  
      Unlimited  
      Can reinforce coding 
      but complex combinations can be confusing
