 Structural Information<body>

  Structural Information  
      Structural information about the architecture is needed by:
 
  Simulator (cycle-accurate, structural simulation)
  Compiler
       The ADL contains a library of predefined components.
 
  The components are organized in a hierarchical manner.
  Compound-components are composed of simple-components.
  Each simple-component contains a cycle-accurate behavioral description.
    Memory components are parameterizable.
  cache (line-size, set-size, associativity, etc)
  main-memory (size, width, storage-type, internal-organization)
    Pipeline behavior is specified in the control-unit.
       The user instantiates the components and specifies the connectivity.
