  Lesson 43 - Free Speech 4:  
  Government as Sovereign -- 
Three Levels of Protection      
 
 Say the government is acting as sovereign. The power it has to restrict speech depends on which of the three categories the speech falls into:  

   -  CONSTITUTIONALLY VALUELESS SPEECH: Some speech has (close to) no constitutional protection, because the Supreme Court has concluded that it lacks constitutional value. This generally includes: 

   False statements of fact said by people who know the statements are false (or who show reckless disregard of the possibility of falsehood).   Obscenity (more about that later).   Child pornography.   Statements that are intended to, and likely to, incite more or less immediate lawless conduct.   Threats.   Criminal solicitation or conspiracy.   
-  SPEECH GIVEN INTERMEDIATE PROTECTION: Some speech is protected to some extent, but not entirely: 
   Commercial advertising is unprotected if it's false (even negligently false) or misleading; it may also be unprotected in some other cases.    Speech that is not obscene but quite sexually explicit also has some protection, but in some respects not as much protection as "fully protected" speech.   
-  FULLY PROTECTED SPEECH: All other speech has maximum constitutional protection. This includes: 
   Speech about politics, society, religion, philosophy, and science.   Art, literature, music, poetry.   Jokes, gossip, entertainment, and casual chit-chat.   Pretty much anything else that doesn't fall into the valueless or intermediate categories.    
 Common MYTH: "Only political speech is fully protected." No; to be fully protected, speech doesn't have to be political or in any way exalted -- it just has to be outside the valueless or intermediate boxes.
