 ICS 269, Winter 1996: Theory Seminar 

  1 March 1996: 
Generating Triangulations without Repetitions 
Jason Cahill, ICS, UC Irvine 

(Based on a paper by D. Avis and K. Fukuda, to appear in  
Discrete Applied Math  as "Reverse Search for Enumeration") 

 The reverse search technique has been recently introduced by the
authors for efficient enumeration of vertices of polyhedra and
arrangements. In this paper, the authors develop the idea in a
broader framework and show its applications to various problems in
operations research, combinatorics, and geometry. 

 In my talk, I will be discussing the motivations and details of
reverse search, followed by a discussion of how it can be applied
to the problem of generating all possible triangulations to a set
of  n  points in the plane.
