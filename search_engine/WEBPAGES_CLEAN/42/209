    Catalog Description 
 
Current research and research trends in software. Forum for presentation
and criticism by students of research work in progress. May be repeated

 Instructor's Description 
 
This seminar is an opportunity for students to give presentations about their
research interests and on-going work. Talks can be more formal, such as powerpoint presentations that are practice for conference or job talks. They might be less formal such as a description of work-in-progress followed by a guided discussion of open issues. In both cases, the emphasis is on students learning to present their work
and critically discuss the work of others.
  
On the first meeting, students choose a time and preferably a topic for 
presenting during the quarter.
