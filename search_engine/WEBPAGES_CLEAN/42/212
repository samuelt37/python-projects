Solving $k$-SUM Using Few Linear Queries
 
 
Jordan Jorgensen
 

 The $k$-SUM problem is given $n$ input real numbers to determine whether
any $k$ of them sum to zero. The problem is of tremendous importance in
the emerging field of complexity theory within $\mathsf{P}$, and it is in
particular open whether it admits an algorithm of complexity $O(n^c)$
with $c<\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil$. Inspired by an algorithm due to Meiser
(1993), we show that there exist linear decision trees and algebraic
computation trees of depth $O(n^3\log^2{n})$ solving
$k$-SUM. Furthermore, we show that there exists a randomized algorithm
that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil+8})$ time, and
performs $O(n^3\log^2{n})$ linear queries on the input. Thus, we show
that it is possible to have an algorithm with a runtime almost identical
(up to the +8) to the best known algorithm but for the first time also
with the number of queries on the input a polynomial that is independent
of $k$. The $O(n^3\log^2{n})$ bound on the number of linear queries is
also a tighter bound than any known algorithm solving $k$-SUM, even
allowing unlimited total time outside of the queries. By simultaneously
achieving few queries to the input without significantly sacrificing
runtime vis-Ã -vis known algorithms, we deepen the understanding of this
canonical problem which is a cornerstone of complexity-within-$\mathsf{P}$. We
also consider a range of tradeoffs between the number of terms involved
in the queries and the depth of the decision tree. In particular, we
prove that there exist $o(n)$-linear decision trees of depth
$\tilde{O}(n^3)$ for the $k$-SUM problem.
