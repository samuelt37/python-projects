  Architecture-based approach  
      Supports
 
  addition, replacement, and removal of behavior
  intermediation between existing parts
  behavior-based: interposition, wrap, and augment
  communication-based: monitoring, layering, and replacement
    reflexive change
  add-ons operate on an accurate representation of the system model that is deployed with the system
    separation of component functionality from component communication using connectors
  reduces accidental dependencies
