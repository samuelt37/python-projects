  DokuWiki  
 

 

    DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use  Wiki , mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful  Formatting syntax  which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text files – no database is required.
