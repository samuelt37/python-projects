  Course:   Seminar in Artificial Intelligence  

 ICS: 279 

 Instructor: Max Welling 

 Time: Tu-Th: 3.30-4.50 PM 

 Location: CS 253. 

 

  

  Prerequisites :  None  

 

  

  Goals:   The main objective of this course is for
the students to be introduced to some of the research  
that is being conducted at ICS here in UCI. I have asked a number of faculty
who do research in 
areas related to artificial intelligence to either talk about their most
representative work or to send me 
an article about their most representative research, which we will treat in
class.  

  If time allows, some timely
topics in AI and statistics will be studied, in particular approximate
inference methods  
on graphs such as belief propagation, mean field and exact sampling.  

  Students will be asked study a
paper from the literature and prepare a presentation on a topic related to the
material treated in class.
