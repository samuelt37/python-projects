         Important: </strong> From this point on, you
      must have cookies enabled in your browser, otherwise no
      administrative changes will take effect.

        Session cookies are used in Mailman's
      administrative interface so that you don't need to
      re-authenticate with every administrative operation.  This
      cookie will expire automatically when you exit your browser, or
      you can explicitly expire the cookie by hitting the
       Logout  link under  Other Administrative
      Activities  (which you'll see once you successfully log in).
