 Abstract  
The paper evaluates empirically the suitability of Stochastic Local Search algorithms
(SLS) for finding most probable explanations in Bayesian networks. SLS algorithms 
(e.g., GSAT, WSAT [16]) have recently proven to be highly effective in solving 
complex constraint-satisfaction and satisfiability problems which cannot be solved
by traditional search schemes. Our experiments investigate the applicability of this
scheme to probabilistic optimization problems. Speciffically, we show that algorithms
combining hill-climbing steps with stochastic steps (guided by the network's probability
distribution) called G+StS, outperform pure hill-climbing search, pure stochastic 
simulation search, as well as simulated annealing. In addition, variants of G+StS that 
are augmented on top of alternative approximation methods are shown to be particularly 
effective.
