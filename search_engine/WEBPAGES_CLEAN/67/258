 Emily Navarro<body>  Assignment 3, Part 2: Refactoring    Due date: February 10th 5:00pm   Informatics 122  Software Design II  Winter 2015  Professor Emily Navarro      Description  
Use refactoring to improve the design of your implemented MakeAGraph. You should apply at least 2 refactorings. Each refactoring should be either from the lecture or from one of the Websites/books I mentioned in the refactoring lecture. Each use of a refactoring should be carefully motivated in a brief accompanying document.      Deliverables  
Each individual must turn in:  1. A printed copy of their restructured code (just the classes/places where refactorings were applied). Please highlight the lines that were changed.  2. A printed document describing:   	 * The motivation for each refactoring   	 * The impact each refactoring has on the design (i.e., how far reaching is the change to incorporate the refactoring?)  Both of the above can be combined with  part 1  of this assignment, i.e.,  * Hand in one copy of your restructured code (with patterns and refactorings applied)  * Hand in one accompanying document (addressing both patterns and refactoring)      Grading  
You will be graded on three things for Assignment 3-2:  1. Usefulness of the refactorings  2. Rationale  3. Level of design understanding shown in your refactorings and rationale </body>
