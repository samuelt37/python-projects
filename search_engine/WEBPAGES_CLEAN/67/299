 Glider Shuttles 

 The  p216 gun  uses a variety of different
p24-glider interactions, but there is one more 180-degree turn that
I didn't use. Here is a period-120 shuttle that shows it off: 

     

 One can also base shuttles on reflections from other
oscillators; Dean found this family of period 24+30n shuttles based
on a p3 turn.
