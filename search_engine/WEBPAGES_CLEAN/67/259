 [Tim Berners-Lee, 1991, �About HTML�]

   Standard, Open Document Formats since the 1960s (GCA�s GenCode, IBM�s GML)
 
     SGML [ISO 8879:1986] can prove the validity of any document using standardized DTDs, complex structuring, extensions
 
     In 1990, Berners-Lee picked tags from a sample SGML DTD and added a �killer feature�: links
 
     
 
     The World-Wide HTML tagset is limited to the 80/20 rule
 
     XML allows Community-Wide Markup Languages,combining SGML�s power with HTML�s simplicity
