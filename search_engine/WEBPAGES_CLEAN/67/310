                   The Computable Plant project has been active in developing, evaluating, and introducing a new set of techniques for high school and pre-service 		                   science teachers as well as undergraduate students.
                   
                   Outreach activities focus on the training of high school teachers in the annual 
                    "Grounding in Botany"  
                   program of the  Huntingon Botanical Gardens ,
                   which continues to host more than 500,000 visitors per year.
                   
                   This program holds remarkable promise for linking cutting-edge knowledge and 
                   techniques with K-12 teachers' and students' understanding of plant development and integrative biology.
