Algorithms for Graphs via Orthogonal Range Searching
 
 
Sergio Cabello 
 
 
I will explain how orthogonal range searching has been useful to
improve the running time of algorithms solving the following
problems:
 
a) Computing the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices
in a graph of bounded treewidth.
 
b) Computing the dilation of a geometric graph of bounded treewidth.
 
c) Computing an optimal pricing in the Stackelberg shortest path tree
game.
 
 
(Parts a) and b) are joint work with Christian Knauer.)
