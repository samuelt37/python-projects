Signatures of Correct Computation

We introduce  Signatures of Correct Computation  (SCC), a new
model for verifying computation in cloud settings. In an SCC model, a
trusted  source  outsources a function  f  to an untrusted
 server , along with a public key for that function. The server
can then produce a succinct signature σ vouching for the
correctness of the computation of  f , i.e., that some result  v  is
indeed the correct outcome of the function  f  evaluated on some point
 a . Moreover, the signature verification must take
asymptotically less time than evaluating the function  f . We
construct efficient SCC schemes supporting expressive manipulations
over multivariate polynomials, including polynomial evaluation and
differentiation, and we prove that our constructions are
adaptively-secure in the random oracle model.
 
 
We also show that signatures of correct computation imply
 Publicly Verifiable Computation  (PVC), a model recently
introduced by the research community. Roughly speaking, in the SCC
model,  any client  can verify the signature σ and be
convinced of some computation result, whereas in the PVC model only
the client that issued a query (or anyone who trusts this client) can
verify that the server returned a valid signature (proof). Our
techniques can be readily adapted to construct publicly verifiable
computation schemes with adaptive security and  without the
random oracle model .
