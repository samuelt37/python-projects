				  IBM, Research Triangle Park   msquire@vnet.ibm.com  

				 Author, editor, or reviewer of: 
				   A multivariate two-sample test using the Voronoi diagram  
				  Possibly the same as the Matt Squire involved in network protocols for IETF? (listed as at Nortel in Durham, March 1999, and as affiliated with WindWire in http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iptel-trip-03.txt dated 14 July 2000). Maybe it's not that uncommon a name but the geographical proximity is suggestive.
