               Course Objectives 
            The effectiveness of data-driven technologies as decision support tools, data exploration and scientific discovery tools is closely tied to the  quality of data  on which such techniques are applied. It is well recognized that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the quality of data on which
            the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior to pushing data through the analysis pipeline. Forrester Research group has estimated
            that the market for data quality passed the $1 Billion mark in 2008.  
            The objective of this course is to deepen our understanding of  recent trends  in information quality research, that is, this is not a comprehensive data quality course. We will focus specifically, but not exclusively, on data management techniques for solving  entity resolution (ER)  problem. The ER challenge arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects, leading to ambiguity. This ambiguity must be resolved, or taken
            into account, when analyzing the data to produce meaningful results.  
            The course will be based on student presentations of prominent publications in the area of information quality. There will be a list of publications to be covered in the class. The students will choose publications that they want to present from that pool and they will decide the dates of their presentations. Presenting papers not from that pool is also encouraged, but please get an approval from the instructor well in advance.




             Prerequisites 
            Basic understanding of databases and machine learning.
