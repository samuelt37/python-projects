   Data Set Information:  
 Dota 2 is a popular computer game with two teams of 5 players. At the start of the game each player chooses a unique hero with different strengths and weaknesses. The dataset is reasonably sparse as only 10 of 113 possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All games were played in a space of 2 hours on the 13th of August, 2016 

   Attribute Information:  
 The features for this dataset are three game information fields and the 10 hero choices for each team of a possible 113. The first column is the game result, -1 for dire victory and 1 for radiant victory (the names of the two teams).
