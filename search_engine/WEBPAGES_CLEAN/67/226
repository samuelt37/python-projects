    public class  GraphicsBinding 
    extends  ComponentThread 
   
GraphicsBinding class. 
GraphicsBinding accepts notifications from C2 components above it and
reifies them as calls to Java AWT methods.  It also transforms 
user-generated events into C2 requests, which are sent up an 
architecture.  
The binding currently supports manipulation of AWT frames, panels, 
buttons, text fields, arcs, lines, ovals, rectangles, and text 
strings.  The binding is extensible and is intended to support additional
AWT functionality.   
   GraphicsBinding's C2 Message Interface  
GraphicsBinding's methods should not be invoked directly in a C2
architecture.  Instead, the binding's functionality is accessed via C2
notifications.  In response, the binding invokes Java AWT methods and
generates C2 requests, which it then sends to components above
it in the architecture. 
NOTE:  Italicized message parameters have a default value and are 
hence optional.
