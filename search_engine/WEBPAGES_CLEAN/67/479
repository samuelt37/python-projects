       Time zone:
       
       Configuring your time zone will result in all
      dates and times displayed on this site to use your time zone
      instead of that of the server. 
      
       
        Example: The current time is  08:36:52Z</strong> (UTC).
         
          In the default time zone, this would be displayed as
             00:36:52-08:00</strong>.
       
       Note: Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) is also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 
        A positive offset is used to indicate a timezone at the east of Greenwich, i.e. ahead of Universal Time.
