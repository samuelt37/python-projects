A note on acyclic edge coloring of complete bipartite graphs
  By Manu Basavaraju and L. Sunil Chandran  
Presented by Siddharth Gupta
  
Abstract : An acyclic edge coloring of a graph is a proper edge coloring 
such that there are no bichromatic (2-colored) cycles. The acyclic chromatic 
index of a graph is the minimum number k such that there is an acyclic edge 
coloring using k colors and is denoted by a'(G). 
 In this paper, the authors prove that a'(Kp,p) = p+2 = Delta+2 when p is 
prime. They also show that if we remove any edge from Kp,p, the 
resulting graph is acyclically Delta + 1 = p + 1-edge-colorable.
