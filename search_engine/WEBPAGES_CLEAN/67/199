3.1.52 SetRxnRole 
 
   
virtual bool SetRxnRole(unsigned int role)
    
Set the reaction role of an atom in a reaction molecule/transform.
The set of unsigned integer values for this property is defined by the
 OERxnRole  namespace.  The default value is zero,
 OERxnRole::None , which means that the atom does have a role,
 i.e.  is part of a normal molecule.  Other values include
 OERxnRole::Reactant ,  OERxnRole::Agent  and
 OERxnRole::Product  which correspond to reactant, agent and product
atoms in a reaction or transform.  The reaction role property may be
retrieved using the  OEAtomBase::SetRxnRole  method.
