      1. A simple telephone system consists of two central (a.k.a. end) offices and a single toll office to which each central office is connected by a 1 MHz full-duplex trunk. Each telephone call requires 4 kHz. The average telephone is used to make 4 calls per 8 hour workday. (Don't worry about calls at night.) The mean call duration is 6 minutes. Ten percent of the calls are long-distance, i.e. pass through the toll office. What is the maximum number of telephones a central office can support? [Adapted from Tanenbaum problem 2.18]
