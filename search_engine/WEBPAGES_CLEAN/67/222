    public class  StackPieArtist 
    extends  ComponentThread 
   
StackPieArtist class. 
Implements a graphical visualization of a stack.  Maintains an abstract
model of the top of the stack and an arc from zero to  stack_top
 mod  360  degrees. Also maintains buttons to push
elements onto the stack, pop them off the stack, and access the top
element.  A text field allows a user to specify the value to be pushed,
and a quit button to exit the application to which the Artist belongs.  
The Artist issues stack manipulation requests to a stack ADT above it in
a C2 architecture and notifications to components (if any) below
it.  In turn, it receives notifications from the stack ADT and requests
from a graphics server and acts accordingly.  
   StackPieArtist's C2 Message Interface 
StackPieArtist's methods should not be invoked directly in a C2
architecture.  Instead, the Artist's functionality is accessed via C2
messages (requests and notifications). In response to those messages,
the Artist emits requests to a stack ADT above it and sends notifications
of its internal state changes down.

 StackPieArtist 
 
  public StackPieArtist()
 
   
 StackPieArtist 
 
  public StackPieArtist( String  _name)
 
  
 
    
   
  create  
 
  public void create( String  _name)
 
   Creates and initializes an instance of the StackPieArtist.
      Parameters: 
       _name - Name of the class.
         
  start  
 
  public void start()
 
   At startup, creates an abstract viewport, panel, quit, push, pop,
and top buttons, and a text field, and emits notifications of these
changes to any listening components below.  It also requests the current
state of the stack, in the case that the component is added to an already
running architecture.
      Overrides: 
        start  in class  ComponentThread 
         
  handle  
 
  public synchronized void handle( Request  r)
 
   Handles requests resulting from a user's manipulation of stack's
depiction.  Depending on the request, it either sends stack manipulation
requests to the ADT, records the value of the text field, or sends a
 ApplicationTerminated  notification to the graphics binding (when the
quit button is pressed).
      Parameters: 
       r - Request to be handled.
        Overrides: 
        handle  in class  Component 
         
  handle  
 
  public synchronized void handle( Notification  n)
 
   Handles notifications from the stack ADT.  If the ADT notifies that the
stack has been pushed or popped, the top of the stack is requested.
When the ADT sends a notification with the stack's top value, that value 
is recorded in the Artist's abstract text field and an abstract arc whose
size corresponds to the top value is created; the Artist sends a 
notification of this state change down.
      Parameters: 
       n - Notification to be handled.
        Overrides: 
        handle  in class  Component
