 On The Time Complexity Of Bucket Elimination Algorithms 

 Javier Larrosa 

 
 Abstract  
In this short note, we prove the time complexity of full-bucket and
mini-bucket elimination [1, 2]. In previous papers, when discussing the
complexity of these algorithms, only the importance of the exponential
contribution was emphasized and the rest of the contributions to the cost
were not carefully considered. In this note, we address this fact and
provide a non-trivial bound for the non-exponential contribution to the
complexity of both algorithms. We demonstrate the result for the Additive
Combinatorial Optimization Problem case.
