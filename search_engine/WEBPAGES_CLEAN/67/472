Sorting and Selection with Equality Comparisons
 
 
Will Devanny
 

 
Abstract:
We consider the fundamental sorting and selection problems on a list of
elements that are not necessarily from a totally ordered set. Here relation
between elements are determined by ‘equality’ comparisons whose outcome is =
when the two elements being compared are equal and = otherwise. We determine
the complexity of sorting (finding the frequency of every element), finding
mode and other frequently occurring elements using only =,= comparisons. We
show that Ω(n 2 /m) comparisons are necessary and this many comparisons are
sufficient to find an element that appears at least m times. This is in sharp
contrast to the bound of Θ(n log(n/m)) bound in the model where comparisons
are  or ≤, &gt;.
