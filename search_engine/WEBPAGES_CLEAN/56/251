A presentation of results from
        "Moving an Angle Around a Region"
        by Frank Hoffman, Christian Icking, Rolf Klein, and Klaus Kriegel,
        in  Proc SWAT '98 ,  Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
        Science , Stockholm, 1998, and
        online publication by the  Journal of Discrete &amp; Computational
        Geometry

Let D be a connected region inside a simple polygon P. Authors
          define the angle hull, AH(D), of D to be the set of all points 
          in P that can see two points of D at a right angle. They further
          prove that the perimeter AH(D) is at most twice the perimeter
          of the relative convex hull of D. In special case, when P is 
          the full plane, this bound is given as {/pi}/2. Both bounds are
          tight.
  
The practical application of this topic is found in designing on-line
competitive navigation strategies for autonomous robots in unknown
environments.
