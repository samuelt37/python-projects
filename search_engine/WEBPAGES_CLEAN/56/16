2.1 Creating and Destroying Molecules 
 

 
OEChem molecules use C++ constructors and destructors, allowing them to
be defined and used much like normal variables.  The example, below
represents the smallest possible OEChem program.  This creates a
molecule called  mol  when main is run, and destroys it automatically
when the program finishes.

  
    #include "oechem.h"

using namespace OEChem;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;
  return 0;
}

By using C++ constructors and destructors there is no need to explicitly
call a function to allocate and initialize the molecule, and also no
need to explicitly destroy it when we're done.

  
Of course, there may be times when it is necessary to create and destroy
molecules dynamically.  This is possible using C++'s new and delete
operators to allocate a molecule.

  
    #include "oechem.h"

using namespace OEChem;

int main()
{
  OEMol *ptr;

  ptr = new OEMol;
  delete ptr;
  return 0;
}
