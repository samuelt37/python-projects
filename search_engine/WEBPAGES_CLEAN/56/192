 <body> 1  The entire HTML source is currently saved,
to allow for experimentation in feature extraction methods.   As we will
describe in Section 5, it is sufficient to just store a short summary of a
file. 
 2  In addition, it contains a function to retrieval and locally store
the HTML source of all links accessible from the current page.  Syskill &amp;
Webert analyzes the HTML source of a page to determine whether the page matches
the user's profile.  To avoid network transmission overhead during our
experiments, we prefetch all pages. This also ensures that experience are
repeatable if a page changes or is no longer accessible.  
 3  Although it would be possible to use an incremental learning
algorithm, our current implementation is not incremental.   
 4  We have created a local copy of this page, removing much of the
in-line graphics, since access to the full page at the remote site was slow and
unreliable.   
 5  We experimented with a variant of TF-IDF that operated on 128
informative words. It did not perform as well as TF-IDF operating on all
words.  
 6  This differs slightly from the previous average for naive Bayes
because a different set of random examples was used in this experiment.  
 7  Of course, some pages may be considered interesting to a user not
because of the content but because they point to many interesting pages. We do
not believe Syskill &amp; Webert users consider such pages interesting because
Syskill and Webert requires a user to associate an index page with each topic
and this already contains many links.
