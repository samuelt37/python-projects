Parallel Equivalence Class Sorting: Algorithms, Lower Bounds, and
Distribution-Based Analysis
  
William E. Devanny
  We study parallel comparison-based algorithms for finding all
equivalence classes of a set of $n$ elements, where sorting according to
some total order is not possible. Such scenarios arise, for example, in
applications, such as in distributed computer security, where each of $n$
agents are working to identify the private group to which they belong,
with the only operation available to them being a zero-knowledge
pairwise comparison (sometimes called a “secret
handshake”) that reveals only whether two agents are in the same
group or in different groups. We provide new parallel algorithms for
this problem, as well as new lower bounds and distribution-based
analysis.  (Joint work with Michael T. Goodrich and Kristopher Jetviroj, in
submission.) </body>
