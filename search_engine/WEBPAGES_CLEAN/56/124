Circles, spheres, and sphere packing
 
   A deterministic linear time algorithm for geometric separators
and its applications .

S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 99–108 .   Fundamenta Informaticae  22: 309–330, 1995 
(special issue on computational geometry).
 
Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

    Faster circle packing with application to nonobtuse triangulation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 94-33 , ICS, UCI 1994.  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  7 (5): 485–491, 1997.
 
Speeds up a triangulation algorithm of Bern et al.
[" Linear-Size
Nonobtuse Triangulation of Polygons "] by finding a
collection of disjoint circles
which connect up the holes in a non-simple polygon.
The method is to use a
 minimum spanning tree  to find a collection of
overlapping circles, then shrink them one by one to reduce the number of
overlaps, using Sleator and
Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to keep track of the
connectivity of the shrunken circles.

Improving on a recent breakthrough of Sharir,
we use data structures from
" Dynamic three-dimensional linear programming "
to find two circular disks of minimum radius covering a set
of points in the Euclidean plane, in randomized expected time
O( n  log 2  n ).

    Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   2nd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Durham, North Carolina, 1997.   6th Int. Meshing Roundtable,  Park
City, Utah, 1997, pp. 7–19 .  arXiv:cs.CG/9908016 .  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  10 (4): 347–360, 2000.
 
We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

    Tangent spheres and triangle centers . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/9909152 .   Amer. Math. Monthly  108 (1): 63–66, 2001 .
 
Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .

    Optimal Möbius transformations for information visualization
and meshing .  M. Bern

We give linear-time
 quasiconvex programming 
algorithms for finding a Möbius transformation of a
 set of spheres 
in a unit ball or on the
surface of a unit sphere that maximizes the minimum size of a
transformed sphere. We can also use similar methods to maximize the
minimum distance among a set of pairs of input points. We apply these
results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
 graph drawing , viewpoint selection in
 hyperbolic  browsing, and element size
control in conformal structured
 mesh generation .

    Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres .

 G. Ziegler .  arXiv:math.CO/0204007 .  Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday ,
Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.
 
We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Diamond-kite meshes: adaptive quadrilateral meshing and orthogonal circle packing .

2012, pp. 261–277 .   Engineering
with Computers  30 (2): 223–235 (special issue for the 21st
Int. Meshing Roundtable), 2014 .
 
We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar Lombardi drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1206.6142 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 126–137 .  
We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

2013, pp. 27–36 .
 
We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.
  
    The Galois complexity of graph drawing: why numerical solutions are

Applications  19 (2): 619–656, 2015 .
 
We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.
  
    Balanced circle packings for planar graphs .  M. J. Alam ,

 S. Pupyrev .  arXiv:1408.4902 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.
  
    Maximizing the sum of radii of disjoint balls or disks . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1607.02184 .  Proc. 28th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry , Vancouver, BC,
Canada, 2016.  
We show how to find a system of disjoint balls with given centers,
maximizing the sum of radius of the balls. Our algorithm takes cubic
time in arbitrary metric spaces and can be sped up to subquadratic time
in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension.
