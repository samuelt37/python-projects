  Policies: Object-Centric  
        Placing trust in objects (or keys)
 

         Typically, protect resources with keys
 

      Hand out the combination to a vault
  Secret-sharing can require multiple cooperating keyholders (e.g. a safe-deposit box) 
         Optionally compartmentalize access
 

      Different interfaces have different keys
  Deposit and Withdraw handles in MS COM-speak
    Possession of the right pointer limits the visible functions
  
  Useful when there are fewer objects than users or actions
