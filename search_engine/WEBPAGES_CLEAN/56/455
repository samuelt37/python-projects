First accuracy is an indication of separation quality and the second one is an indication of multi-class classification quality. 5.2 Datasets The datasets used are the  Shuttle   control  , the Letter recognition, the Landsat satellite image, the Pen-based recognition of handwritten and the Page blocks classification databases.

AA.     shuttle  exp consists of the complete set of 278 instances resulting from expanding the 15 rules of the shuttle  landing   control  (shuttle-l-c) dataset. 6 Reported results for hepatitis and shuttle-exp were gathered using 10-way cross validation. Results for the Monk problems used the provided training and test sets, and results for shuttle-l-c
