Track Layout is Hard
  William E. Devanny
  
We show that testing whether a given graph has a 3-track
layout is hard, by characterizing the bipartite 3-track graphs in terms
of leveled planarity. Additionally, we investigate the parameterized com-
plexity of track layouts, showing that past methods used for book lay-
outs do not work to parameterize the problem by treewidth or almost-
tree number but that the problem is (non-uniformly) fixed-parameter
tractable for tree-depth. We also provide several natural classes of bipar-
tite planar graphs, including the bipartite outerplanar graphs, square-
graphs, and dual graphs of arrangements of monotone curves, that always
have 3-track layouts.
