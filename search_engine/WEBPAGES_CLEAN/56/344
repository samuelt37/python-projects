    Academic Integrity    
 
   All students are expected to be familiar with the policy below. Failure to adhere to this 
 policy can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class. 
  
 
  
Academic integrity is taken seriously. For homework problems or programming assignments you 
are allowed to discuss the problems or assignments verbally with other class members, but 
under no circumstances can you look at or copy anyone else's written solutions or code relating 
to homework problems or programming assignments. All problem solutions and code submitted must 
be material you have personally written during this quarter, except for (a) material that you
clearly indicate and reference as coming from another source, or (b) library or utility 
code provided by the  TA or instructor.
 


It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with 
 UCI's Academic Integrity Policies 
and
  UCI's definitions and examples of
academic misconduct .
