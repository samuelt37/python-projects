 On maximizing welfare when utility functions are subadditive 

 Authored by Uriel Feige, appeared in STOC 2006 

 Presented by Matthew Ba Nguyen 

 
Abstract:
  
The author considers the problem of maximizing welfare when allocating
 m  items to  n  players.  In this problem, a feasible
allocation allocates every item to at most one player.
For every player  P i  , her utility  w i  
depends only on the set of items she receives.  The goal is to find a
feasible allocation that maximizes social welfare, that is,
maximizing âˆ‘ w i  (S).
  
The author presents a rounding technique that converts a fractional LP
solution to a feasible allocation resulting in a 1/2 approximation.
More importantly the author shows this is true even when utility
functions are subadditive.
