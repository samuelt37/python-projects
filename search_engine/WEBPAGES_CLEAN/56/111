Near-Optimal Parallel Prefetching and Caching 
Dan Halem, ICS, UC Irvine 

 Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the
operating systems research community in prefetching and caching
data from parallel disks, as a technique for enabling serial
appliications to improve I/O performance. We consider algorithms
for integrated prefetching and caching in a model with a fixed-size
cache and any number of backing storage devices(which we will call
disks). The integration of caching and prefetching with a single
disk was previously considered by Cao et al. We show that the
natural extension of their aggressive algorithm to the parallel
disk case is suboptimal by a factor of (nearly) the number of disks
in the worst case. Our main result is a new algorithm, reverse
agressive, with near optimal performance for integrated prefetching
and caching in the presence of multiple disks.
