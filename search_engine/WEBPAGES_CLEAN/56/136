Fixed-Parameter Tractable Algorithms for Crossing Minimization in Book Embeddings
 
 
Michael Bannister
 

 
Abstract: We investigate exact crossing minimization problems for 1-page and 2-page book drawings of graphs. In both 1-page and 2-page book drawings, the vertices of the graph are drawn in the xy-plane along the x-axis and the edges are drawn as continuous curves that do not cross the x-axis. In 1-page book drawings, the edges must be drawn in the upper half-plane (y &gt; 0), whereas in 2-page drawings the edges may also be drawn in the lower half-plane (y
