 Game Programming<body>
  
  ICS 180, Winter 1999: 
Strategy and board game programming 

 Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:00, CS 243 

 IBM's chess program "Deep Blue" gained national headlines
when it beat the world champion, Gary Kasparov, in a
six-game match.  How did it do it?  How can you program a computer to
play chess, go, or other board games, if not well enough to beat
Kasparov, at least well enough to beat other strong humans?

  This class attempts to answer these questions, by describing the
techniques and programming tricks used to build efficient game-playing
programs.
There will be no homeworks or exams.  However, students
will be expected to do a  programming project .
