 Minimum Dilation Stars in Metric Spaces 

 Kevin Wortman 

 October 21, 2005, in CS 259 

 Abstract: 

 We consider the following problem: given a collection of  n  sites
separated by distances obeying the triangle inequality, create a star
(tree of depth 1) whose root is a new center site and whose leaves
are the input sites, such that the dilation of the star is minimal.
The problem amounts to computing a weight for each of the  n  edges
from the root to the leaves, such that all the weights in the star obey
the triangle inequality.  This talk will describe an
O( n  3 )-time algorithm
for computing the optimal dilation value, which is a significant
component of an algorithm that computes the edge weights.
