Some Results on Greedy Embeddings in Metric Spaces (FOCS 2008)
 
 
By Tom Leighton and Ankur Moitra
 
 
Presented by Darren Strash
 


 
I will discuss a recent proof that resolves a conjecture of Papadimitriou and 
Ratajczak---that every 3-connected planar graph admits a 
greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane.
