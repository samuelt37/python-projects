   Steinitz theorems for orthogonal polyhedra . 
D. Eppstein and
E. Mumford.  arXiv:0912.0537 .  26th Eur. Worksh. Comp. Geom. , Dortmund, Germany, 2010.   26th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Snowbird, Utah, 2010, pp. 429–438 .   J. Computational Geometry  5 (1): 179–244, 2014 .
 
We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.
  
The journal version has the slightly different title "Steinitz theorems
for simple orthogonal polyhedra".

    Diamond-kite meshes: adaptive quadrilateral meshing and orthogonal circle packing . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1207.5082 .   21st International Meshing Round Table , San Jose, California,
2012, pp. 261–277 .   Engineering
with Computers  30 (2): 223–235 (special issue for the 21st
Int. Meshing Roundtable), 2014 .
 
We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar Lombardi drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
  
    Antimatroids and balanced pairs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1302.5967 .   Order  31 (1): 81–99, 2014 .
 Erratum (with V. Wiechert) .
 
We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial
order should have a pair of items that are nearly equally likely to
appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.
  
    Grid minors in damaged grids . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1303.1136 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  21(3), Paper P3.20, 2014 .
 
We give tight bounds on the size of the largest remaining grid minor in
a grid graph from which a given number of vertices have been deleted,
and study several related problems.

For every positive integer  n , there exists a set of  n 
points on a parabola, with the property that every  n -vertex
planar graph can be drawn without crossings with its vertices at these
points and with its edges drawn as circular arcs.

    Superpatterns and universal point sets .  M. J. Bannister ,
Z. Cheng,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0403 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 208–219 . 
Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.   J. Graph Algorithms &amp; Applications  18 (2): 177–209, 2014   (special issue for GD'13).
 
A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.
  
   Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0066 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 436–447 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.
  
    Small superpatterns for dominance drawing .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103  .
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.
  
    Structures in solution spaces: Three lessons from Jean-Claude . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk, Conference on Meaningfulness and Learning Spaces:
A Tribute to the Work of Jean-Claude Falmagne 
Irvine, California, 2014.
 
This talk surveys my work on rectangular cartograms, the 1/3-2/3
conjecture for antimatroids, and flip distance for triangulations of
point sets with no empty pentagon, and how this line of research
stemmed from the work of Jean-Claude Falmagne on learning spaces.

    Wear minimization for cuckoo hashing: how not to throw a lot of
eggs into one basket . 
D. Eppstein,

 M .Mitzenmacher , and
 P. Pszona .  arXiv:1404.0286 .  Proc. 13th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA
2014) , Copenhagen, Denmark, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8504, pp. 162–173, 2014 .
 
We study cuckoo hashing data structures in a model of flash memory in
which each memory cell has a limited number of times it can be changed,
so the goal is to prevent hot spots that change many times.

    Planar induced subgraphs of sparse graphs .  G. Borradaile ,
D. Eppstein,
and P. Zhu.  arXiv:1408.5939 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture Notes
in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 1–12.    J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  19 (1): 281–297, 2015 .
 
We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that  m /5.22 vertices are sufficient
and  m /(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.
  
    The Galois complexity of graph drawing: why numerical solutions are
ubiquitous for force-directed, spectral, and circle packing drawings .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny ,
D. Eppstein, and
 M. T. Goodrich .  arXiv:1408.1422 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 149–161.    J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  19 (2): 619–656, 2015 .
 
We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.
  
    Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs
with bounded treewidth .  M. J. Bannister  and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1408.6321 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 210–221. 
 
We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.
  
    Balanced circle packings for planar graphs .  M. J. Alam ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 S. Kobourov , and
 S. Pupyrev .  arXiv:1408.4902 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.
  
    Flat foldings of plane graphs with prescribed angles and edge lengths .  Z. Abel ,
 E. Demaine ,
 M. Demaine ,
D. Eppstein,
 A. Lubiw , and
 R. Uehara .  arXiv:1408.6771 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 272–283. 
 
Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.
  
     k -best enumeration . 
D. Eppstein.   Encyclopedia of Algorithms   (Ming-Yang Kao, ed.), Springer, added 2014.  arXiv:1412.5075 .   Bull. EATCS  115, 2015 .
 
A brief survey of algorithms for finding the  k  shortest paths and
related  k -best enumeration problems. The arXiv/EATCS version is

    Linear-time algorithms for proportional apportionment . 
Z. Cheng and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1409.2603 .  Proc. 25th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2014) ,
Jeonju, Korea, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8889, 2014, pp. 581–592.   
We consider a broad class of  highest
averages methods  for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.
  
    Minimum forcing sets for Miura folding patterns .  B. Ballinger ,
 M. Damian ,
D. Eppstein,
 R. Flatland ,
J. Ginepro, and
 T. Hull .  arXiv:1410.2231 .   26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms , San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147 .
 
A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

    Folding a paper strip to minimize thickness .  E. Demaine ,
D. Eppstein,
 A. Hesterberg ,
 H. Ito ,
 A. Lubiw ,
 R. Uehara , and
 Y. Uno .   arXiv:1411.6371 .  9th International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation (WALCOM
2015) , Dhaka, Bangladesh.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8973 (2015), pp. 113–124 .   Journal of Discrete
Algorithms  36: 18–26, 2016 .  
If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.
  
    All-pairs minimum cuts in near-linear time for surface-embedded graphs .  G. Borradaile ,
D. Eppstein,
 A. Nayyeri ,
and  C. Wulff-Nilsen .  arXiv:1411.7055 .  Proc. 32nd Int. Symp. Computational Geometry , Boston, 2016.  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) 51, pp. 22:1–22:16 .  
We give the first known near-linear algorithms for constructing
Gomory–Hu trees of bounded-genus graphs, and we shave a log off
the time for the same problem on planar graphs.
  
    ERGMs are hard .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1412.1787 .  
ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.
