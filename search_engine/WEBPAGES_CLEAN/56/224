The Theory of Constraints, Constraints Management, Critical Chain, and 
Throughput Accounting are related issues. They have 
been around long enough that those in business management are sure to have 
some familiarity, even if only name recognition. On the other hand, the most 
important of the implementing processes, the Thinking Processes, are little 
discussed and even less well known. While Goldratt mentions one or another of 
the five processes in his latter books, there is nothing in print available 
from the Goldratt Institute. If one wishes to learn how to work the Thinking 
Processes, they must be trained at the Goldratt Institute; with one 
exception, a text written by H. William Dettmer and published by ASQC Press 
titled "Goldratt's Theory of Constraints; A Systems Approach to Continuous 
Improvement."

  

As a student and personal friend of Dettmer, I have advocated his book as one 
of the best written texts in process improvement. 
He has reduced and simplified Goldratt's methodology to something everyone 
can understand and apply. This Socratic cause/effect methodology is a 
powerful and compelling approach to problem solving in any area where some 
type of constraint is controlling 
reality. Starting with a Current Reality Tree (CRT) to determine the several 
root causes and prevalent core problem constraining the system, one gains 
knowledge of what needs to be changed. Using the Conflict Resolution Diagram 
(CRD or Evaporating Cloud) to unearth underlying assumptions leading to 
conflict, solutions and alternatives may be discovered and developed into a 
Future Reality Tree (FRT). This resolves the issue of what to change to. 
Finally, the question of how to implement the change is handled by the 
processes of constructing a Prerequisite Tree (PRT) and a Transition Tree 
(TT). In this presentation we describe each of the five 
elements and the Categories of Legitimate Reservation, those test elements 
which look into the logic of the cause/effect relationships.

  

 Biography: </strong>
By education, Dr. Novick is a Materials Scientist with degrees from the 
University of Arizona, MIT and Columbia. 
By vocation he is a technical manager with an MBA from Fordham and 40 years 
experience performing and managing fundamental and applied R&amp;D, operations, 
sales and marketing. By preference he is a problem solver and facilitator of 
continuous process improvement; a profession he now pursues as a technical 
advisor on process improvement for The Boeing Company.
