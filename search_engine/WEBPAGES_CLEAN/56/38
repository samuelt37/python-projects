 Abstract  
The paper evaluates the effectiveness of learning for
speeding up the solution of constraint satisfaction
problems. It extends previous work (Dechter 1990)
by introducing a new and powerful variant of learning
and by presenting an extensive empirical study on
much larger and more difficult problem instances. Our
results show that learning can speed up backjumping
when using either a fixed or dynamic variable ordering. 
However, the improvement with a dynamic variable ordering 
is not as great, and for some classes of problems learning 
is helpful only when a limit is placed on the size of new 
constraints learned.
