  Links  

 Links are sets of  anchors . All of the other
concepts discussed in this overview provide the foundation for the power
of Chimera links. Since anchors are associated only at a conceptual level
with  objects  and  views ,
links can forge paths between a wide range of information. Links can contain
any number of anchors. Viewers can directly create links and anchors to
them using the Chimera API. The end-user authors links by employing the
following process. 

  Using a link editor, the user creates a new empty link.
    The user selects the new link to make it  active . The active
  link is shared between all of a user's clients.
    The user can then add anchors to the active link from any active client
  by selecting the appropriate anchor and invoking the  Add_Anchor_To_Active_Link 
  operation. Almost all Chimera clients provide access to this operation
  in some fashion, typically by using a pull-down or pop-up menu.
   The default link traversal semantics for Chimera is to send a link traversal
event to all clients which manage the destination anchors of the link. Developers,
however, can customize the semantics of link traversal for an application,
or suite of applications. For more information, see the  on-line
documentation . 

 Developer Information
