   Data Set Information:  
 This database does NOT use a standard set of attributes per instance.  Contact Ray Bareiss ( rbareiss  '@'  uunet.uucp  ?) for more information.  Domain expert: Professor Craig Wier of the University of Texas, Austin.   

   Attribute Information:  
 (all attributes are nominally valued)    1. case identifier.    2. classification (24 classes)    3. List of case features       -- format: form f(v) should be read as "feature f has value v"
