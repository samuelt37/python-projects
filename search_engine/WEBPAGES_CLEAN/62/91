Fast Algorithms for Minimum Weight Constant Length Cycles in Edge-Weighted Graphs
 

 presented by Mike Nelson 

 
 Abstract: 
  
I will present some results from "Finding the Smallest 
H-Subgraph in Real Weighted Graphs and Related Problems", by Virginia 
Vassilevska, Ryan Williams, and Raphael Yuster.
This work appeared in the International Colloquium on Autotmata,
Languages and Programming 2006.
I will present their deterministic algorithm for 
finding the minimum weight cycle of length  k .
For a fixed (constant)  k , the algorithm has running time
that is sub-quadratic in  m , the number of edges.
