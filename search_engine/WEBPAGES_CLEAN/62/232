     Brief description:  
PolylithQ is a re-implementation of the University of Maryland
	Polylith 2.1 system but using Q for its underlying IPC.
    	It provides essentially the same functionality as Polylith 2.1
	but adds the following capabilities.
	   Compatibility with other Q based distributed programs.
        	   All connections direct but with no loss of functionality.
        	   Richer type system.
        	   Better Ada support.

     Cost:  
None; it is available via anonymous FTP.
 
     Degree of support/maturity/testing/usage:  
This was constructed as an experiment to compare
	Q and Polylith.  No support will be provided except that
    	bugs will be fixed.
 
     Speed:
