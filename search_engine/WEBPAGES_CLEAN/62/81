The Tech. Report used the more informative title
"Updating widths and maximum spanning trees using the rotating caliper graph",
which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the  rotating caliper
graph  of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.
