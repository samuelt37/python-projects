     n   The previous example showed 4 network     interfaces with the following addresses:     128.3.2.3, 128.3.4.1, 128.3.1.2, 128.3.3.1     n   This is a class B
 address, 128.3 indicates the     internet routing
 part.      n   The 2.3, 4.2, 1.2 and 3.1 digits at the end of     the address form the host and subnet     address. The subnet and the host address     consist of 8 bits each in this example.
