We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching
parts of the meshes are small.

    Motorcycle graphs: canonical quad mesh partitioning .

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in  straight skeleton  construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.
