 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Reified Communication  Intent       Connector modification?   Also Known As        Other well-known names for the mechanism, if any.     Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Reified connectors have the following benefits:       Locus is independent of participants          Mediation at application level         Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses       C2's Connectors, Higher Order Connectors, and ORB    Interceptors are examples of reified connectors.   Related Mechanisms       The reified connector is a particular type of  communication    intermediation .      Backto the Adaptation home page   .
