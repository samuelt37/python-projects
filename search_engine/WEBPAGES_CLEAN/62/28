    TMBpro Overview 
TMBpro is a suite of specialized predictors for predicting
secondary structure, beta-contacts, and tertiary structure of Transmembrane
Beta-Barrel (TMB) proteins. TMB proteins are embedded
in the outer membranes of mitochondria, Gram-negative bacteria
and chloroplasts. These proteins perform critical functions, including
active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a
need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of
TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail
on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures
have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform
to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space
drastically, it is possible for alignment free methods, such as TMBpro, to be applied successfully.
