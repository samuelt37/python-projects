        My research interests fall in areas of 
        ( i ) Secure System Architectures.
        ( ii ) Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (side-channel and fault analysis).
        ( iii ) Security Standards.
        ( iv ) High-performance Architectures and Their Compilers. 
        ( iv ) Machine-learning Assisted Program Optimization. 
       

       
        I earned my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science from the   University of California Irvine  
        (Spring 2013), my Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Embedded Systems from the University of California Irvine (Spring 2009), 
        my Master Degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the   Universita' degli Studi di Napoli "Federico II", Naples , 
        Italy in 2004. 
       
        
        Currently (from Summer 2013 to date), I am part of  Qualcomm Research , San Diego, CA. 
       
      Currently, I teach both undergraduate and (mostly) graduate classes in parallel and distributed computing, parallelizing and optimizing compilers at UC Irvine.
      

      
      Currently, I am a Chapter Lead of the UCI Alumni Chapter in San Diego.
