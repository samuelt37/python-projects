The 1998   California Software 
Symposium (CSS '98)  is the eighth in a series of annual 
meetings on software engineering co-sponsored by UCI's  Irvine Research Unit in Software 
(IRUS)  and USC's  Center for Software 
Engineering (CSE) . The purpose of these symposia is to bring together 
researchers and practitioners to share ideas and experiences. Emphasis is 
on early dissemination of new ideas and empirical evaluation and on 
experience with software techniques on actual projects. We feel confident 
you will find that CSS '98 continues the tradition of high-quality, 
peer-reviewed presentations and panel discussions.

  

This year's featured topic,  Software Engineering in a Fully Connected 
World , is complemented by presentations on such topical items as 
social and organizational implications of software, Web and Internet related 
standards and technologies, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), 
workflow and process, metrics including the COCOMO II project, 
Off-the-Shelf (OTS) technology, software comprehension, and legal 
implications. These topics are presented in a variety of formats: paper 
presentations, panels, a keynote address, and new this year, a 
mini-tutorial.

Networking, Knotworking and Net-Knitting: 
Maintaining Connection in the New Economy
</strong> 
 

  

Is the 
fully connected world all attributable to technology? 
Obviously there is social work that is necessary for building 
real human networks. I have been studying how people work across 
organizational boundaries, investigating the work of consultants, 
contractors, cross-company business partners, experts such as attorneys 
and reference librarians, high level managers, brokers such as technology 
transfer advocates, and workers in customer-vendor relationships. I 
contrast this kind of cross-linking work to teamwork which 
has the been focus of most CSCW research. My research shows that a 
significant amount of effort goes into constructing, construing and 
maintaining social networks and varying social presences in 
cross-linked work. Technologies such as the telephone and the Internet 
are crucial to this work, though face to face communication persists as 
an important tool. Knotworking and net-knitting 
are forms of working within a network. I will discuss organizational and 
technological implications of these activities that characterize work in 
today's economy. 

  

  Biography: </strong>  Bonnie A. Nardi ,  nardi@research.att.com , is an 
anthropologist in AT&amp;T Labs-Research in Menlo Park, California. She has 
lived and studied in Papua New Guinea and Western Samoa, and has 
investigated the technological habits of spreadsheet users, brain 
surgeons, reference librarians and American teenagers, among others. She 
is currently studying human networking in the new economy. Bonnie Nardi 
is the author of  A Small Matter of Programming: Perspectives on End 
User Computing , MIT Press, 1993, and the editor of  Context and 
Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction , MIT 
Press, 1996. Her new book, co-authored with Vicki O'Day,  Information 
Ecologies: Local Habitations for People and Technology , will be 
published by MIT Press in November, 1998.

The Internet reversed the evolutionary relationship between
technology and law which was previously typical of "fully connected",
internationally deployed systems.  Widespread telecom and airline
network connectivity grew up shielded by a regulatory framework,
i.e., was the progeny of bi/multilateral agreements hammered out
between countries and their carriers.  In contrast, worldwide 
Internet availability preceded awareness of most social and 
commercial issues.
  
Unprecedented regulatory gaps and conflicts have arisen from this
inversion, for example in cryptographic and security policy, domain
name usage, internet telephony, and advertising and IP norms. 
The panel addresses whether lessons can be "reverse engineered"
from the telecom/airline experiences and new paradims discovered to
deal with these problems and their implications for software development
and deployment.
