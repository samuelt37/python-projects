4.23 OECalculateMolecularWeight 
 
   
double OECalculateMolecularWeight(const OEMolBase &amp;mol, bool iso = false)
    
This function calculates the molecular weight of the given molecule.  By
default, all atoms are assumed their average atomic weight, as returned
by the  OEGetAverageWeight  function.  If the `iso' parameter is
true, and atom of the molecule that has a specified (non-zero) isotopic
mass, as returned by  OEAtomBase::GetIsotope , instead uses the
isotopic weight as returned by the  OEGetIsotopicWeight  function.
