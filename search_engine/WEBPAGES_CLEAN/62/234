 An O(log log n)-Competitive Binary Search Tree with Optimal Worst-Case Access Times 
 Audrey Hesse, UC Irvine 

 We present the zipper tree, an
O(log log  n )-competitive online binary search tree that
performs each access in O(log  n ) worst-case time. This shows
that for binary search trees, optimal worst-case access time and
near-optimal amortized access time can be guaranteed simultaneously. 

 (Based on  a paper  by Bose, Douïeb, Dujmovic,
and Fagerberg in SWAT 2010.)
