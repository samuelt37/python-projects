  UNDO              
  The UNDO function allows for the
      
last user action(s) to be "undone". The presence of an UNDO functions encourages
users
to
explore

the functionality of a system.    

  
      Guidelines:    
     Even when a general UNDO
         function is available, special UNDO functions should nevertheless be
        preserved  
     E.g., delete left, delete right, second click on selected menu items to undo
        
the selection.  
      They can be activated more quickly and  already became a convention.  
       If an UNDO function is available,
          everything should be undoable, if possible 
       It 
        is difficult for users to understand that some actions in a program that have 
        local effects only (like saving a document to the harddisk, or overwriting a document) 
      cannot be undone.  
        [In contrast, users understand
                easily that actions that have  external  effects (like
                
sending an email message) cannot be undone.]  
      
     Multiple 
  UNDOs should be possible

            sequence of UNDOs and REDOs 

      Any other keyboard input expunges the REDO memory  
       If confirmation for UNDO or Cancel is requested,
        it must be carefully formulated (avoid double negation, e.g. double "cancel")
