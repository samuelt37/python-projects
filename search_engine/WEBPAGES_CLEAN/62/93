 Affordances<body>
  Affordances      "term 
that refers to the properties of objects -- what sorts of operations and manipulations 
can be done to a particular object"  (D. A. Norman 1988, The Psychology 
of everyday things).      A 
door affords opening    A 
chair affords support     "perceived 
affordance": the extent to which objects suggest their affordance.     
   
        
      User interface elements
    should be designed in such a way that they clearly indicate their affordances.
