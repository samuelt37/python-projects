4.4.2 Use of the conformer state 
 

 
OEMCMolBases have four functions which control the current state of the
molecule with respect to conformers.   SetActive  takes an OEConfBase
as an object and makes the OEMCMolBase act exactly like an OEMolBase with
the "Active" conformer as the only conformer.  The  GetActive 
function returns a pointer to the currently "Active" conformation.  There
are many OEMolBase functions which access the single-conformer coordinates
of a molecule.  When these functions are called on an OEMCMolBase, the
coordinates of the "Active" conformer are returned.  Similarly, if the
OEMCMolBase does not have a title or energy of its own, the title or energy
of the active conformer will be returned.  This is particularly convenient
when passing the molecule to a function which has been written to use or
manipulate the coordinates of an OEMolBase.

  
    #include "oechem.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace OESystem;
using namespace std;

float GetMaxX(const OEMolBase &amp;mol)
{
  OEIter&lt;OEAtomBase&gt; atom;
  float xyz[3];
  float maxX = 0.0f;
  bool first = true;
  for(atom = mol.GetAtoms();atom;++atom)
  {
    mol.GetCoords(atom,xyz);
    if(first)
    {
      maxX = xyz[0];
      first = false;
    }
    else
      if(xyz[0] &gt; maxX)
        maxX = xyz[0];
  }
  return maxX;
}

int main()
{
  OEIter&lt;OEMCMolBase&gt; mol;
  OEIter&lt;OEConfBase&gt; conf;
  oemolistream ims;

  for (mol=ims.GetMCMolBases(); mol; ++mol)
  {
    for(conf = mol-&gt;GetConfs(); conf; ++conf)
    {
      mol-&gt;SetActive(conf);
      cerr &lt;&lt; "maxX = " &lt;&lt; GetMaxX(*mol) &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}

While the  SetActive  and  GetActive  interface is sufficient for
most uses, it is sometimes necessary to think of a more complex
representation of the state of the molecule.  The OEMCMolBase also has
 PushActive  and  PopActive  functions which extend the control
over the active conformation.  All four of these functions work together to
determine which conformation is the current active conformation.  The
active conformation is the top conformation in a stack of OEConfBases help
by the molecule.   SetActive  changes the top conformation on the
stack, while  GetActive  returns the top conformation on the stack.
 PushActive  puts a new conformation in the top position of the stack,
pushing all other members of the stack down.   PopActive  removes the
top conformer in the stack (allowing the next lower conformer to become the
active conformer).  The conformer stack is helpful for using the state of
an OEMCMolBase within a function while restoring the molecule to its original
state before returning it.
