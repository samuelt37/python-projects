	Parallel Lam-Delosme Simulated Annealing in Mathematica
       

       
	Simulated annealing is a numerical optimization technique. The
	Lam-Delosme annealing schedule provides a particularly efficient
	method of performing this process. More information about
	Lam-Delosme is
	available  here .
	  
	Source code implementing parallelized Lam-Delosme simulated
	annealing 
	within   Mathematica    
	is available
	 here . 
	An example which optimizes the parameters for a simple
	 xCellerator  
	model is  here .
