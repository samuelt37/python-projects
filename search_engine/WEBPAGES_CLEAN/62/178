     Based on the work of Bilardi &amp; Preparata we might be able to derive theoretically sound (yet practical) metrics of locality for a given application by compiler-analysis of the data-reference patterns in the code. 
 
     
 
     These metrics can be a valuable tool in both reconfiguration monitoring and scripting.
