         ReactDBPopulator  
      Script to read SDF or other (reaction) molecule files and insert 
      into the ReactDB as specific (level 3) reaction_steps.
     
     
         
      
         ReactionSynthesisIteratorPreparer  
      Reaction synthesis table doesn't really have a parent.
     
     
         
      
         ReactionStepIteratorPreparer  
      Main outer loop iterator which does the actual walk through the 
      (reaction) molecule input stream which presumably hits one reaction 
      molecule at a time.
     
     
         
      
         AnnotationTypeIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction_step.
     
     
         
      
         ReactionStepAnnotationIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction step annotation.
     
     
         
      
         ComponentTypeAnnotationIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction_step.
     
     
         
      
         ChemicalAnnotationIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction_step_chemical to generate a parent 
      chemical record for a new reaction component.
     
     
         
      
         ReactionStepChemicalAnnotationIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction step chemical (as annotations).
     
     
         
      
         ComponentTypeIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction_step.
     
     
         
      
         ChemicalComponentIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction_step_chemical to generate a parent 
      chemical record for a new reaction component.
     
     
         
      
         ReactionStepChemicalComponentIteratorPreparer  
      Called once per reaction step chemical (as a reaction 
      component).
     
     
         
      
         ReactionFileIteratorPreparer  
      Called once, should just produce one item for the input file the 
      script is working on
