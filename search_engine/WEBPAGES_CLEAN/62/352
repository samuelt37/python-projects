         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The null statement performs no action. It is usualls used with the
case statement, to indicate that under certain conditions, no action is
required.
 case ENCRYPTION is
  when "00" =&gt; 
    CPU_DATA_TMP := (B &amp; A) - OPERAND;
  when "01" =&gt; 
    CPU_DATA_TMP := (B &amp; A) + OPERAND;
  when "10" =&gt; 
    CPU_DATA_TMP := (A &amp; B) - OPERAND; 
  when "11" =&gt; 
    CPU_DATA_TMP := (A &amp; B) + OPERAND;
  when others =&gt;
    null;
end case;
  
    
  



 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

The  null  statement is supported by synthesis tools.
 
Note: using a  null  statement in a "combinational process" can
result in latches being inferred, unless all signals driven by the
process are given unconditional default assignments.

  
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, the  null  may have an optional label:
  
label null;
