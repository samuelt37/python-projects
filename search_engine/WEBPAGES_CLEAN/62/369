      Notes:  </strong>       
Generally, we�d like the default behavior to be what makes most sense for a down-level client, because a down-level client can�t get any other behavior than this.  (Sometimes other considerations forced us to compromise this aim.)
  
There is always a way for a reference-aware client to get the non-default behavior.  (In most cases, by using the No-Passthrough header, which causes the method to be applied to the reference.) </body>
