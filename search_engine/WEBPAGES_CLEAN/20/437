Abstract: 
We consider the dynamic vertical ray shooting problem against
horizontal disjoint segments, that is, the task of maintaining a
dynamic set S  of n nonintersecting horizontal line segments in the
plane under a query that reports the first segment in S intersecting
a vertical ray from a query point. We develop a linear-size structure
that supports queries, insertions, and deletion in O(log n)
worst-case time. Our structure works in the comparison model on a
random access machine.
