  The EXPRESSION toolkit is available as 
downloadable source code which needs to be compiled on a host machine before it 
can be executed. To run EXPRESSION, you will require a machine running Windows 
and Visual C++ installed on it. The EXPRESSION toolkit has been tested on the 
following systems:  
    OS: Microsoft Windows XP Professional, Windows 2000 Server 
System Type: X86-based PC 
Processor: x86 Family 15 Model 1 Stepping 2 Genuine Intel ~1 Ghz 
Total Physical Memory: 512.00 MB 
Total Virtual Memory: 1.72 GB 
Page File Space: 1.22 GB    Development Platform: Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise Edition   

  Additionally, you will also 
require access to a SUN Sparc workstation if you plan to compile your own C 
applications (see manual for details). This step can also be performed online, 
by clicking
 here  
to go to the web based compilation  page where you can upload your C 
program and get the requisite .defs and .procs files needed by the EXPRESSION 
toolkit after compilation.
