  Overview of GIG 1.0 functionality:    

     

  1. GIG can generate
every possible guitar position (to fret 17) for every chord that is specified
by the user. �  GIG can theoretically
generate over a hundred thousand chords (for just one tuning)! �  For each chord, the user can cycle through
all possible positions.    

     

  2. Chord specification
is simple, flexible, and powerful. �  The
number of strings played or muted can be specified. Bass notes and melody notes
can be specified. �  Optional notes can be
specified.    

     

  3. GIG supports every
tuning, as long as the notes are in the range from F# (0th octave) to D# (4th
octave). �  Tunings are changed by
horizontal mouse gestures.    

     

  4. GIG supports every
capo placement, including full capos, partial capos, and even single string
capos. �  Each string can have its own capo
placement. �  Capos are added and removed
by vertical mouse gestures.    

     

  5. Every chord can be
heard in many different MIDI sounds.    

     

     

  Overview of Composer
1.0 functionality:    

     

  1. Composer 1.0 is a
mini-sequencer/scratch-pad that can record any sequence of chords in GIG.    

     

  2. Six different
strumming/picking patterns can be used to play the chord sequence.    

     

  3. A text-area
specifies the sequence of recorded chords along with each chord's length in
quarter notes.    

     

     

   

    II. Tuning the Virtual Guitar          

         

 The default tuning for G.I.G. is the standard tuning for 6-string
guitars:  E very  A ngry  D og  G oes  B erserk  E veryday. �  Okay, that�s just actually just a
memorization technique for beginning guitar students. �  Here�s the standard tuning table:

     Table 1. Standard
Tuning for Guitar    

     

 Amazingly, you are able to customize the tuning of the virtual
guitar. �  Perhaps you want to try a
super-secret alternate tuning. �  Or maybe
you have never played the guitar outside of the  E very- A ngry- D og tuning (see above). �  The G.I.G. applet is perfectly suited to
experiment with alternate tunings. �  You
can tune any string in the virtual guitar to have a pitch from low, low F# (0th
octave) to high, high D# (4th octave), and you won�t even have to worry about
breaking guitar strings or finding that long lost electronic tuner. 

     

  How do I change a
string�s pitch?    

       

 To change a string�s pitch, simply click-and-drag a
horizontal line from one side of the tuner to another. �  Depending on which side of the tuner you
start to drag from, the pitch will either increase or decrease by a half-step. 

     

  For the top three
strings:    

 Dragging to the right increases
pitch by a half-step while dragging to the left decreases pitch by a half-step. 

     

  For the bottom three
strings:    

 Dragging to the right decreases
pitch by a half-step while dragging to the left increases pitch by a half-step. 

     

 Although this scheme may seem complex at first, the mouse
gestures accurately simulate the twisting of a tuner on a real guitar. �  Now here is something only the virtual guitar
can do: you can tune multiple strings simultaneously by dragging over multiple
tuners! 

     

  How do I know what
the current tuning is?  

     

 The note name and octave are prominently displayed on each
tuner. �  This display is modified whenever
a string�s tuning is changed. �  You can
hear the tuning�s sound if you press �Hear Tuning� (however, if a capo is on
the virtual guitar, the capo will be heard instead of the open tuning).  

     

     

     

    III. Adding/Removing Capos    

  

         

 By default, the virtual guitar has no capos. �  Don�t worry though, since adding and removing
capos are simple. �  You can even add a
different partial capo for each string. 

     

  How do I add a capo?    

     

 After moving the mouse pointer to the desired fret,
click-and-drag a vertical line  from top
to bottom  over the string(s) that you would like to capo.  � You can repeat this procedure for every capo
you would like to place on the virtual guitar fretboard. 

     

  How do I remove a
capo?    

     

 After moving the mouse pointer to the desired fret,
click-and-drag a vertical line  from bottom
to top  over the string(s) from which you would like remove the capo. �  You can repeat this procedure for every capo
that you wish to remove on the virtual guitar fretboard. 

         

  How do I hear the
open sound of the guitar with the capo?    

       

 Press �Hear Tuning� to hear the open sound of the guitar
with the capo. 

     

     

     

    IV. Specifying a Chord          

         

 Chord specification is the most important part of
G.I.G. �  Rather than internally storing
many different chord spellings, G.I.G generates chords intelligently. �  Satisfying exact matches of chord spellings
on a guitar fretboard can be restrictive, since it may be hard to fit in
certain notes. ��  Instead of using this
restrictive approach, G.I.G. determines which chord notes are necessary and
which notes are optional. �  G.I.G. then
returns all the chord positions that (1) have all the necessary chord notes in
them and (2) play only necessary or optional notes (there�s a subtle difference
between 1 and 2). �  Most chord notes are
put into the �optional� category to give the widest range of chord positions
possible. 

     

  Root:    

       

 Every chord has a root note from which to build the
chord. �  The root note is an optional note. 

     

  Type:    

       

 There are four types of chords: major, minor, diminished,
and augmented. �   �  

     

 If major is selected, the 3 rd  and 5 th 
notes (from the root) are made optional notes (if there are no conflicting
extensions). �   

     

 If minor is selected, the flatted 3 rd  note is
made a necessary note and the 5 th  note is made an optional note (if
there are no conflicting extensions). 

     

 If diminished is selected, the flatted 3 rd  and
the flatted 5 th  are made necessary notes. 

     

 If augmented is selected, the 3 rd  is made an
optional note (if there is no conflicting extension) and the sharped 5 th 
is made a necessary note. 

     

  Extension 1:    

     

 There are four choices for extension 1: none, 6 th ,
7 th , and maj 7 th . �   

     

 If the type is major, minor, or augmented, and if �none� is
not selected, the note corresponding to the user�s choice is made a necessary
note. 

     

 If the type is diminished, the only extension that is
recognized is the 7 th  note. 

     

  Extension 2:    

     

 There are six choices for extension 2: none, 6 th ,
2 nd , sus4, b5 th , and b9 th . 

         

 If the type is major, minor, or augmented, and if �none� is
not selected, the note corresponding to the user�s choice is made a necessary
note. 

         

 If the type is diminished, the choice for extension 2 is
ignored. 

     

  Bass:    

     

 An optional bass note can be specified if desired. �  If a bass note is specified, then a lowest
note of every chord position would be that bass note. �  If the bass note is not specified, then the
chord positions can use any necessary or optional note as the bass note. 

     

  Melody:    

         

 An optional melody note can be specified if desired. �  If a melody note is specified, then the
highest note of every chord position would be that melody note. �  This option is very useful for developing chord
voicings with interweaved melody lines. 

     

  Key:        

         

 An optional key can be given to add to the flexibility of
the chord positions. �  If a key is
selected, that key�s note as well as the 5 th  note from the key will
be made optional notes. 

     

  Extra Note:    

       

 Specifying an extra note is another way to add to the
flexibility of the chord positions. �  If
an extra note is selected, that note will be made an optional note. 

     

  # Non-Mutes:        

         

 There are four choices for this option: full chord, at least
5, at least 4, and at least 3. �  If �full
chord� is chosen, then the only chord positions returned are those that play
all of the strings. �  Similarly, if �at
least &lt;k&gt;� is chosen, then the only chord positions returned are those
that play &lt;k&gt; or more strings. �
 Unlike the other options above, this option can be modified while you
cycle through the chords. 

     

  Note: After specifying
the chord, press �Load Chord� to view the initial chord position. �  Read the next section for more details.    

       

       

     

    V. Seeing/Hearing Every Chord Position    

  

         

 After specifying the chord (see previous section), simply
press �Load Chord� to view the initial chord position. �  This initial chord position is the closest
possible position to the head of the guitar. �
 The fingering of the position will be shown on the fretboard and the
chord name will be displayed on the top of the applet. �  Each time you specify a new chord, you should
press �Load Chord� to internally load the chord and to display the new chord. 

     

 You can hear the chord by pressing �Hear Chord�. �  There are many different MIDI
sounds available for playback: 

     

   
   Classical Guitar 
   
   
   Acoustic Guitar 
   
   
   Jazz Electric Guitar 
   
   
   Clean Guitar 
   
    
   Muted Guitar

     Table 2. �  Available MIDI
sounds �������      

     

 Jazz Electric sounds especially good, while Pad gives an
interesting effect. �  Ever wanted to know
how a piano or harp would sound when played through a guitar fretboard? �  With G.I.G. you can! 

     

  How do I view another
position for the same chord?    

       

 Simply press the �&lt;&lt;� button to view the next position
for the same chord. �  You can keep
pressing �&lt;&lt;� until you move all the way up the fretboard! �  Once you reach the last available chord
position, pressing �&lt;&lt;� will cease to have effect. 

     

  How do I return to a
previous position for the same chord?    

       

 Simply press �&gt;&gt;� as many times as you wish to return
to previous positions.  � Once you return
to the first chord position, pressing �&gt;&gt;� will cease to have effect. 

     

     

     

    VI. Using Composer 1.0          

         

 Composer allows you to create creative guitar
progressions. �  After making a
progression, you can hear the progression played with various strumming and
picking patterns. 

     

  How do I add a chord
to the Composer progression?    

       

 The chord must first be loaded in G.I.G. before it can be
added to the progression. �  Then the
desired position should be found using the �&lt;&lt;� and �&gt;&gt;�
buttons. �  Once the desired chord position
is found, the chord can be added by pressing �Add Chord�. �  Before pressing �Add Chord�, you should
specify how long that chord should be played. �
 You can do this by selecting the quarter-note length (1, 2, 3, or 4). 

     

 Once you add the chord, the chord name will be displayed in
the Composer text area. �  Dashes will also
be displayed after the chord. �  The number
of dashes indicates the length of that chord in quarter-notes. 

     

  How do I remove a
chord in the Composer progression?    

     

 Only the last chord added can be removed from the
progression. �  Simply press �Remove Last
Chord�. 

     

  How can I clear the
entire progression?    

       

 Simply press �Clear All�. 

     

  How can I hear the
progression?    

       

 Before hearing the progression, you can specify the type of
playing pattern: 

     

   
    Strumming Patterns    
   
   
    Picking Patterns    
   
    
   Down-strums (a beginner strum) 
   
   
   Simple Picking 
   
    
   Marching Strum 
   
   
   Advanced Picking 
   
    
   Syncopated Strum (a widely used strum) 
   
   
   Jazz-Comp (ignores the 2 nd  and 4 th 
  quarter note chords). 
   
     Table 3. Composer
Playing Patterns    

     

 You can also control how fast the progression playback
should be by specifying the Beats Per Minute (BPM). �  The allowable range of BPM is 40-160, and the
default BPM is 100. 

     

 To hear the progression, simply press �Play�. �  The sequence will take a few seconds to
develop, so it is best to wait patiently for the sound. �  Then the music can be heard. �  If you press �Play� while the progression is
playing, no action will be taken. 

     

  How do I stop the
progression?    

 Simply press the �Stop� button to end the progression.
