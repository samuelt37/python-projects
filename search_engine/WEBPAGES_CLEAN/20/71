  LaTeX Symbol Lookup

  LaTeX make file  
 
 name  =  paper
options  =   -- file - line -  error 
 ifeq   "$(shell uname)"   "Darwin" 
        options  +=   -- shell - escape  -- synctex = 1
 endif 
 
all :   $  (  name  )  . pdf
 
 $  (  name  )  . pdf :      *. tex  *. bib figures /*  
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        bibtex  $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
 
clean : 
        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . aux  . blg  . log  . out  . synctex . gz ) 
 
distclean :               clean
        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . bbl  . pdf )  

 

  Internal hyperlinks  
 

 
Include this in your preamble:
 
 \usepackage{hyperref} 

 
Then, instead of
 
 Theorem~\ref{thm:name-of-theorem} 

 
use
 
 \autoref{thm:name-of-theorem} 

 
as well as working better when you change a lemma to a theorem (etc), this produces better hyperlinks: the link covers the whole “Theorem 3” text not just the number.
 

 

  Less than and greater than signs in text mode  
 

 
With the default settings, LaTeX turns &lt; and &gt; in text-mode input into ¡ and ¿. This is usually just a minor annoyance (they should probably have been in math mode rather than text mode) but occasionally you really need them to render properly: for instance, when they are part of a DOI in a bibliography reference, where you don't have as much control over how to render them. The following magic code in your preamble causes them to be rendered properly:
 
 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
