 Problems in CSCW<body>
       Key 
problems in CSCW            
       1. In any type of
      meeting:   
    
        "Channel
  limitations"          (In face-to-face conversations, the meaning of a message
        is transported as follows [Mehrabian 1972]: 7% verbally, 38% para-verbally
        (intonation,
        volume) and 55% non-verbally (facial expression, gestures, body language))         
    
  
     
    2. In multi-party
remote meetings:    
    
        - Turntaking (audio delay, video angle, 
          lack of peripheral/sublimal awareness...):                                               strict floor control   
     
         - 
  Lack of immersion       
    
    
    3. 
In multi-party physical meetings with remote members:    
    
         
    - Same as above, for remote members       
  
      -   Social
        
dynamics changes    
                 
     
   
    
     4. In 1 on 1 conferencing
      
(but also multi-party)    
  
  
        Eye contact
