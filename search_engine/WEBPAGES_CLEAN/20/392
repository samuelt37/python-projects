     Goal  

     The goal of the  PSearch
    Project  is to make it easier to search for UCI People.  It has
    a single input search box, which allows keyword queries on people
    name, UCInetID, telephone number, department, and title. It has
    the following features:
     

       Supports interactive search : search as you type; 
        Allows minor errors in the keywords ; 
        Supports synonyms , e.g., "William = Bill", and "OIT
      = Office of Information Technology"; 
        Allows multiple keywords . 
      We use the UCI Directory data provided
    by  OIT .
