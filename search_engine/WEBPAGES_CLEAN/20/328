We study cuckoo hashing data structures in a model of flash memory in
which each memory cell has a limited number of times it can be changed,
so the goal is to prevent hot spots that change many times.

We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.
