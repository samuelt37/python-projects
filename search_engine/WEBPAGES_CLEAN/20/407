11.3.15 Sort 
 

 
    
bool Sort(const OEBinaryPredicate&lt;T,T&gt;&amp;)
    
The  OEIter&lt;T&gt;::Sort  method sorts contents of the iterator and resets
the iterator to its first item.  The re-ordering is local to the given
instance of the iterator ( i.e. , the container holding the items the
iterator traverses is unchanged).  Once this function is called the
iterator is never delete safe, even if it normally would be.

  
The  OEBinaryPredicate&lt;T,T&gt;  passed to this function is used as the less
comparison in the sort.  It should return true if the first argument is less
than the second argument and false otherwise.  An item that is less than
another item will appear first after sorting.
