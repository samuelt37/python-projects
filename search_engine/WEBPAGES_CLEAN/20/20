    was born in either Malcov, or Obrucna (both are in northwestern Slovakia today), or 
    Görlice, Galicia, in 1848, the youngest of 7 boys. At Shlomo's bris, Raphael Meyer, his 
    oldest brother, was given an honor (like sandik or kvatah). In the 1870's he immigrated 
    south to Hungary. At Tiszakerecseny, he obtained papers changing his name to Schönfeld. 
    He married Chaya () (1852 - 1922 [27 Sivan]), daughter of Avrohm Hersh Gross, 
    who was a chassid of R. Chaim of Sanz, and one of 12 children (11 boys &amp; 1 girl). Mrs. 
    S.L. Mendlovic of Williamsburg has much information on the Gross family. Shlomo &amp; 
    Chaya had 8 children. Shlomo became a very affluent cattle dealer. He owned a 350 acre 
    farm and made an annual trip to Switzerland to purchase cows. He maintained that Swiss 
    cows produced superior milk. He was also an agent for the Gott estate. In 1903 (?) he 
    moved to Hodasz, and in 1912, to Nyirbator, Hungary where he lived a healthy life until his 
    passing. In the fall of 1931 he developed a blockage in his intestine. Realizing that his end 
    was near he summoned the family to his bedside. (My grandfather and great-uncle [Naftuli 
    &amp; Shabsi Yitzchok] came from the Kaliva (Nagykallo) Yeshiva by train that Thursday 
    night. Chava Israel was also there). He passed away that night, November 5, 1931,

    ago his descendants, Chava Israel and Miriam Werczberger, had his grave site restored.

Pushka died when the children were very small &amp; they were raised by her parents. Avrohm's second marriage was to Gittel, the daughter of Moshe Shamshon Scheindlin. On her tombstone in Vranov nad Toplou it says she passed on 5 Tishrei 5689. Avrohm lived in several places. At first he lived in Lubacov (Lubaczow). He then moved to Mudyerotska (Mudjovitz) where he built a beautiful glass and marble house. He even built a glass factory just to make the glass for the house. He came to the US to learn glass making (see Bertha Miller). He also lived in Kvakovitz. Before World War I he moved to Vranov nad Toplou. He had a tremendous estate there, which took several days to traverse on horseback. After World War I it was confiscated. He sent some of his gentile watchman back to the estate but they were murdered. Avrohm had 10 children from his second marriage and at least several were born there. His mukom menucha (place of burial) is in Presov, where he spent his final years.
