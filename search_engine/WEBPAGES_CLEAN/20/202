    and complete a random multi-step synthesis problem.
      
    Click on each screenshot to advance to the next step.
           Step 01: Navigate to the Synthesis Problem Setup Section 
          Top  
       
               
            Click on the "Synthesis Explorer: Multi-Step Synthesis Design"
            link under Featured Sections.
         
            Step 02: Set up a Random Problem 
          Top  
       
               
            Fill in the contents of the problem setup box
            and click on "Generate Problem" to have the
            system prepare a synthesis problem for you.
              
            Note that you should leave the "Synthesis Problem" selection
            as "(Generate Random Synthesis)" to work on a random problem.
              
            Note the context-sensitive help box to the right of the setup box
            which (in the actual system) will describe whatever control you last pointed the cursor at.
              
            Mouse over the screenshot to see an example of the filled out form.
            Click on the screen shot to continue on to a walkthrough
            of how to actually complete a synthesis problem
            after you have prepared one from this setup box.
