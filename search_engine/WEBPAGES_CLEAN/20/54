4.148 OETriposTypeNames 
 

 
    
bool OETriposTypeNames(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
This function loops through the atoms of the molecule, setting the
string atom type property of each atom, to atom type name of the
Tripos Sybyl atom type encoded in the atoms integer atom type property.
This is approximately equivalent to the following operation:

  
    
  atm-&gt;SetType(OETriposTypeName(atm-&gt;GetIntType()))
    
If both the string and integer atom types are required, it is faster
to call  OETriposAtomTypes  and then  OETriposTypeNames 
(which reuses the results of the first call) than it is to call
 OETriposAtomTypes  and  OETriposAtomTypeNames .
