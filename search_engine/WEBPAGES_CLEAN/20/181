    Assignment 03  :  
   Goal:  Learn how to generate a Map U/I from dynamic real-time data. </strong> 
   
          This assignment may be done alone or in a group of 2  
           Use Google Maps v3 ( API Reference )  
            Embed a Google map into a copy of the webpage from Assignment 2
               Make a copy of the old page and edit the copy so that you don't mess up the grading of Assignment 2  
              
           After your AJAX call returns, collect the geo-data from your data source and plot the geo coordinates onto the map interface next to your table. 
           Add links for each element in the table that will center the map on that location when it is clicked. 
           Enhance the map in one interesting way of your choice. For example:
              Make different types of locations have different icons on the map 
               Program a context-menu at each location upon right-clicking the map icon with relevant options for that location (e.g., Directions to here, Wikipedia links, Flickr Images, etc.) 
              
           Turn in your assignment using the EEE quiz which will have one question for the URL of your webpage 
           This is all due Saturday morning at midnight (10/30 12:00am) right right as it becomes Saturday.
