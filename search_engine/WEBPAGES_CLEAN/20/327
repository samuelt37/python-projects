virtual OEAtomBase *GetEnd() const
    
Return the ``end'' (or ``destination'') atom of a bond.  The end atom
of a bond is defined either when the bond is created with
 OEMolBase::NewBond , or possibly by a call to the
 OEBondBase::SetEnd  method.  If the end atoms was specified as
the NULL pointer, (OEAtomBase*)0, when the bond was created, this
method may return a NULL pointer.
