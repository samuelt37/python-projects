  �         
  10 heuristics, .25 pts per, 2.5 pts 

  �         
  Your analysis should address who the intended users of
the site are, what the users want to achieve by using the site, how the site
failed to serve these users and their goals (including, if applicable,
characteristics of the users and their backgrounds that the site designers
didn't understand or accommodate well), and what makes your suggested
improvements better. �  1 pt  

  �         
  Student met requirements above (1 pt) 

  �         
  Your analysis should focus on usability issues rather
than pure functionality; while the line is sometimes hard to draw (adding a
search feature, for example, is increased functionality that also affects the
usability of a site), don't try to solve the problems by making the system into
something that it wasn't intended to be. �  1
