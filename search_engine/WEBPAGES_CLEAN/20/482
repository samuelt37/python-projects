      Programs exhibit different effect from each mechanism
 
  none is a consistent winner     	
       Within a program, the same holds in the time domain between mechanisms.
 
     Both of the above facts indicate a likely improvement from adaptivity
 
  Select a better one among mechanisms
       Even more can be expected from adaptively re-allocating from the combined buffer pool
 
  To reduce stall time
  To reduce the number of misses
