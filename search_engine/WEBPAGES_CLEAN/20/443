			 Abstract 
			 
				Moving object environments are characterized by large
numbers of moving objects and numerous concurrent continuous queries over these objects. Efficient evaluation of
these queries in response to the movement of the objects is
critical for supporting acceptable response times. In such
environments the traditional approach of building an index
on the objects (data) suffers from the need for frequent
updates and thereby results in poor performance. In fact,
a brute force, no-index strategy yields better performance
in many cases. Neither the traditional approach, nor the
brute force strategy achieve reasonable query processing
times. The efficient and scalable evaluation of multiple
continuous queries on moving objects can be achieved by
leveraging two complimentary techniques: Query Indexing
and Velocity Constrained Indexing (VCI). Query Indexing
relies on i) incremental evaluation; ii) reversing the role
of queries and data; and iii) exploiting the relative locations 
of objects and queries. VCI takes advantage of the
maximum possible speed of objects in order to delay the
expensive operation of updating an index to reflect the
movement of objects. In contrast to techniques that require
exact knowledge about the movement of the objects, VCI
does not rely on such information. While Query Indexing
outperforms VCI, it does not efficiently handle the arrival
of new queries. Velocity constrained indexing, on the other 
hand, is unaffected by changes in queries. A combination 
of Query Indexing and Velocity Constrained Indexing
enables the scalable execution of insertion and deletion of
queries in addition to processing ongoing queries.
