  Conclusions  
      Cartesian Product Attributes
 
  Allow joint probabilities to be estimated from data
  Improve accuracy of Bayesian Classifier
  Improve accuracy of PEBLS
  Require data to be discretized
  IncreasesBSEJ
  Wrapper approachesAccuracy gained by from joint probability estimates rather than product of individual probabilities
  Accuracy lost due to imprecision of estimating joint probabilities
