 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Wrapper  Intent       A wrapper insulates a service provider (e.g., a server or    component) from all service consumers. Wrappers typically    accomplish this by taking on the identity of the service    provider.   Also Known As        Other well-known names for the mechanism, if any.     Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences        How does the mechanism support its objectives? What    are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern? What    aspect of system structure does it let you vary    independently?          Description of consequence         Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses        Examples of the mechanism found in real systems. Try    to include at least two examples from different domains.     Related Mechanisms       Wrappers are a particular type of component    intermediation. Wrappers are similar to the Decarator    software pattern.      Backto the Adaptation home page   .
