 Updating the Course Library Instructions
     
 
  
  
From time to time I will ask you to update the course library, as I extend it,
  debug it, or add special functionality for the projects I assign.
Please follows the steps below when asked to do so.
   Courselib Updating 
  Download and unzip the  new 
        courselib.zip   file;
    the result is a  courselib  folder.
 

   Locate the workspace folder 
      (typically  C:\Users\ yourname \cppworkspace  for PCs and
       /Users/ yourname /Documents/workspace  for Macs)
      and copy the contents of the  src  folder in the
       new courselib  folder that you downloaded and unzipped
      (its  .hpp  and  .cpp  files) into the  src  folder in
      the  courselib  folder in this workspace.
 

   Either click the  Hammer  icon   or 
      right-click the  courselib  icon in the  Project Explorer  tab
      and select  Build Project .
    The build should finish successfully and the  Debug  folder in the
       courselib  folder in the workspace should contain an updated
       libcourselib.a  file.
 

   Now any new or old project that refers to  courselib  will use the
      new library: both its source files and compiled code.
 
    Note that to run old projects with the new library you will have to
       Clean  and re- Build  the project.
