              Abstract   
  We introduce a strategy for parallelizing a state-of-the-art
  sequential search algorithm for optimization on a grid of
  computers. Based on the AND/OR graph search framework, the procedure
  exploits the structure of the underlying problem graph. Worker nodes
  concurrently solve subproblems that are generated by a single master
  process. Subproblem generation is itself embedded into an AND/OR
  Branch and Bound algorithm and dynamically takes previous subproblem
  solutions into account. Drawing upon the underlying graph structure,
  we provide some theoretical analysis of the parallelization
  parameters. A prototype has been implemented and we present
  promising initial experimental results on genetic haplotyping and
  Mastermind problem instances, at the same time outlining several
  open questions.
