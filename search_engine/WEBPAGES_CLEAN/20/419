   Tangencies : Three Tangent Circles 
 
Any three points can be the centers of three mutually tangent circles.
To construct the circles, form a triangle from the three centers,
bisect its angles (blue), and drop perpendiculars from the point where the 
bisectors meet to the three sides (green).  The points where these 
perpendiculars cross the sides are the desired points of tangency.
They are also the points where an inscribed circle (red) is tangent to the 
triangle; this circle has its center at the point where the six lines meet,
and crosses the three tangent circles perpendicularly at their tangent 
points.

   

 

 The same construction works to form two circles inside a third, but you 
should use two external bisectors and one internal bisector instead of 
three internal bisectors. (Curious fact: three bisectors meet iff the 
number of external ones is even.) If you move 
the anchor points in the animation around, you may be able to reach a 
configuration like this.

  Similarly to this pattern,
 four tangent circles 
also always have a circle through their tangencies,
but it is not always perpendicular to them.
