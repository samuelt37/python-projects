	The purpose of this demo is to show our solution on how to find relevant answers to mistyped spatial-keyword queries. It is built using the  GeoNames geographical database  which contains geographical objects (such as lakes and hills). We used the objects residing in the U.S., and the final dataset had about 1.8 million objects. The total data size was 100MB.
