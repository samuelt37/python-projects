						 Geof will be speaking as part of the  Yahoo! Lecture Series  at the  University of Michigan’s School of Information  on April 10, 2013.  
   The End of the Article </strong> 
Abstract: 
In this talk, I analyze the development of the scientific article as the coin of the realm for the transmission of knowledge.  I argue that the database, over the past 200 years, has grown into a form of transmission and exploration which has been largely under-recognized.  I then discuss examples of new forms of knowledge expression which both deploy databases more effectively and move from a largely logocentric model to one engaging a wider set of senses.  Finally, I explore the possibilities for developing these new forms within the academy.
