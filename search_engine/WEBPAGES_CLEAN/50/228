  Ipe Tutorial: Introduction  
 

 

This is more of a random list of how-to topics than a tutorial.
 

 

  Basics  
 

 

There are three main categories of file for Ipe: 

 
    Ipe document (.ipe, .pdf, .ps, etc.) 
 
   Style sheets (.isy) 
 
   Ipelets (.lua) 
 
  

  Ipe Document  
 

 

Ipe can save and open documents in a variety of formats, including xml, pdf, and postscript. See the  Ipe Manual  for more details.
 

 
You can use  ipetoipe  to convert between these different formats. Sometimes, this might be necessary to fix problems with the program:
 

 

  Quote character (") in a layer name  
 

 

Never put quote characters (”) in the name of a layer. Ipe will crash when you try to open such a document.
 

 
Internally, Ipe saves files as xml. Even if you save it as a pdf, Ipe will embed the xml inside the pdf. Ipe must be able to parse this xml in order to properly load a file. However, if you put (”) characters in places that get written as metadata, Ipe will not be able to parse the xml. You will get poorly formatted xml that looks like this:
 
 
&lt;page title="&amp;apos;this&amp;quot; is fixed for titles"&gt;
&lt;layer name="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;view layers="don't_do_"this"" active="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;text layer="don't_do_"this"" transformations="translations" pos="128 704" stroke="black" type="label" width="36.862" height="6.128" depth="0" valign="baseline"&gt;test text&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
 

 

When you try and open this file, you will get an error like this:

 
   Document '/home/jsimons/Desktop/bad_ipe.ipe' could not be opened
  Parsing error at position 6051 

 

Ipe is helpfully trying to tell you which character the xml parser failed on. To fix it, you have to manually edit the xml. If you saved as .ipe, then just open up the file in your favorite text editor and remove the extra quotes from the xml. If you saved it as a pdf, you first have to extract the xml from the pdf (since in the pdf it's saved as a byte stream, you can't see the plain text). One easy way to do this is to run

 
 ipetoipe -xml input.pdf output.ipe 

 

  Style sheets  
 

 

Stylesheets are text files that can be included to customize various formatting aspects of an Ipe document. For example, you can use it to define more colors, add transparency levels, or create gradients. Stylesheets work a bit like preambles in LaTeX. Multiple stylesheets can be used in one Ipe document, and a single stylesheet can be reused over multiple documents.
 

 
By default, Ipe uses a basic style sheet  basic.isy . To use your own stylesheet, you can either have Ipe automatically load it for every document, or you add it manually for each document. You would want to use the former option for things that are useful across documents, like color definition and transparency levels, and the latter option for things specific to the document, like backgrounds and location of the title text.
 

 
Regardless of how you have Ipe load the stylesheet, if the stylesheet changes, you must do  Edit &gt; Update style sheets  for Ipe to see the changes.
 

 

  Loading stylesheets automatically  
 

 

Here's how we can add and change the default stylesheets loaded by Ipe.

 
    Add the stylesheets you want into a styles directory. Typically this is  ~/.ipe/styles  (you may need to create the directory yourself. 
 
   In your customization Ipelet, add the names of all the stylesheets you want to load automatically:  
prefs.styles = { "basic", "good_colors" }
 
 
 
  

  Adding stylesheets manually  
 

 

The workflow of using a stylesheet specific to a document:

 
    Create or open a stylesheet in a text editor. Here is a barebones example:    my-stylesheet.isy  
    &lt;ipestyle   name = "my-stylesheet"  &gt;  
 &lt;!--ipe customization--&gt; 
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   
 
   Edit it. Some examples of things to add can be found in this tutorial. 
 
   Save it. 
 
   Include it in the Ipe document: in Ipe, go to  Edit &gt; Style sheets &gt; Add . 
 
   Update it: in Ipe, click  Edit &gt; Update style sheets . This must be done every time an included stylesheet is modified. 
 
  

  Customizations  
 

 

You can use Ipelets to customize the behavior of Ipe.
 http://ipe7.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_40.html 
 

 
The customization script is written as an Ipelet. The easiest way to do the customization is to copy  prefs.lua ,  shortcuts.lua , and  mouse.lua  in the Ipe lua directory to your Ipelets directory and modify them to your liking. (Use  -show-configuration  to see where these directories are.)
 

 
The  mouse.lua  is also good for discovering all the useful mouse shortcuts in Ipe.
 

 

  Ipelets  
 

 

You can expand the existing functionality of Ipe by using Ipelets, which are  Lua  scripts that Ipe runs on-the-fly. The installed Ipelets can be accessed and used under the “Ipelets” menu item.
 

 
Each Ipelet consists of a single Lua source file with other support files. To install an Ipelet, simply save the files in your Ipelets directory. You can run  ipe -show-configuration  to find out where that directory is (typically, this is  ~/.ipe/ipelets ).
 

 
The bottom of the  Ipe Wiki  has a good list of Ipelets. They include things like automatic page numbering, background boxes for text, and graph drawing tools (where edges will follow when vertices are dragged).
 

 

  CGAL Ipelets  
 

 
This is assuming that Ipe is already installed and runs successfully.
 

 
On debian:
 
 0. Make sure you have cmake
    * $ sudo apt-get install cmake 
1. Get the required cgal library packages and all their dependencies
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
2. Get the demos and examples files
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-demo
    * For me, the demo was installed to /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/
3. Unpack the demo tar somewhere reasonable
    * $ mkdir ~/CGAL
    * $ cd ~/CGAL
    * $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/demo.tar.gz
4. Prepare the demos to be compiled
    * $ cd demo
    * $ cmake .
5. Compile the demo(s). 
To make just the Ipelets, go to the ready-to-compile subdirectory (yes, it's another nested level, demo/demo/), and make.
It will take a few minutes to compile all the Ipelets
    * $ cd ~/CGAL/demo/demo/CGAL_ipelets/
    * $ make
6. Copy the compiled output '*.so' files and the '*.lua' into the Ipelet directory. 
   On the default 7.1.3 Ipe installation, the command is:
    * $ sudo find . -name '*.so' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
    * $ sudo find ~/CGAL/demo/CGAL_ipelets/lua/ -name '*.lua' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
