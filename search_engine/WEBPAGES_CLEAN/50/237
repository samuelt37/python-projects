    Classes and Objects 

    A class is a set of objects that share a common structure and common behavior  Every object is an instance of some class  Common structure is represented by attributes (properties)  Common behavior is represented by operations  An object is a concrete entity that exists in time and space  a class is merely an abstraction    Classes are usually static  their existence, semantics, and relationships are defined before program execution    Objects are dynamic  they can be created and destroyed during program execution
