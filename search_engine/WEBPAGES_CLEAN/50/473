    Requirements 
Analysis    
   
       Analyze...       Activities 
of the workplace:     What goals do individuals or groups pursue? 
    What tasks do they perform?     What actions 
do they carry out.     Artefacts 
of the workplace:      What information is retrieved or created 
in these work activities?      What 
tools are being used?     Social 
context of the workplace:      How are individuals and groups 
organized into larger structures?    What roles are defined 
(implicitly or explicitly)?    How do people depend on each 
other in achieving their goals?    Involve 
 all  stakeholders (users, customers, management, owners...)    Early 
prototyping helps in the requirements analysis phase.
