     About me 
     
           
         
             
                I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at  University of California, Irvine , 
                under the supervision of Prof.  Alexander Ihler . 
                I also closely work with Prof.  Rina Dechter . 
                I've received my B.S. and M.S. in mathematics from  Zhejiang University , and M.S. in computer science from  Oregon State University .

            I am generally interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. 
            Currently, I am mainly working on inference problems in probabilistic graphical models.
