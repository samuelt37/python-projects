  IJGPIS 
   The  IJGPIS  package performs approximate inference in Bayesian networks. The current software computes approximate probability of evidence and belief updating.

  Description 
   IJGPIS is an importance sampling technique that uses the output of Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) to compute a importance distribution. It also uses relational consistency to solve the rejection problem. A more detailed description can be found in [1].       
  Input format: 
   The algorithm uses the ["Ergo file format"].       
  Usage 
   Call the algorithms as follows:               ijgpss [paramters] -f ergo-file    The parameters are detailed below.       
  Parameters 
      --ordering : &lt;minfill,topological,mindegree&gt; What ordering to use.        --i-bound : (int) An integer value for the i-bound (default value is 3)        --num-iterations : (int) The maximum number of iterations for which IJGP is run        --outfile  (string):  The path of the output file (default is out)        --num-samples : (int) The maximum number of samples to be drawn        --time-limt : (int) The maximum time in seconds for which the algorithm is run        --help  : Print this help.
