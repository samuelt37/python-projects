 "My research is actually more of a creative project. I'm creating a video game, a 2d side-scrolling puzzle platformer using C# and XNA. I want to thank the ICS Honors Program for understanding the value of this unorthodox project for my future career, and giving it the green light even though it does not fall under the usual definition of research. Everyone I've interacted with in the program has been helpful and enthusiastic, and overall it's been a good experience."
