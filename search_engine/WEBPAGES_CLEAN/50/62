        $AllowPassword     This variable contains the special "nopass" password which was used in the past to leave pages or groups accessible without a password. Recent PmWiki versions use "@nopass" instead. If your wiki is old and/or may contain pages with the "nopass" password, you should not change it. If that variable is empty or set to false, PmWiki will not check if pages have a special "allowed password".
        $DefaultPasswords     Specifies default passwords for user admin or actions (edit, read, upload). See  PasswordsAdmin#settingsitewidepasswords .
        $EnablePostAttrClearSession    A switch to control whether or not changing a page's attributes causes any existing passwords to be forgotten. The default is that changing attributes forgets any passwords entered; this can be changed by setting   $EnablePostAttrClearSession   to zero.
        $EnableSessionPasswords     Control whether passwords are saved as part of the session.  If set to zero, then session passwords are never saved (although any  AuthUser  authentications are still remembered).
        $SessionEncode     Function to use to encode sensitive information in sessions.  Set this to NULL if you want to not use any encoding.  (See also   $SessionDecode   below.)
        $SessionDecode     Function to reverse the decoding given by   $SessionEncode   above.  Set this to NULL if sensitive session values are not encoded.
        $HandleAuth    This sets the required authentication Level that is necessary to perform an action. When using the following example in your  config.php  you need to be authenticated as editor in order to view the page history:
             $HandleAuth  ['diff'] = 'edit';
         $PageAttributes    Set the string shown on the attributes page when entering a password for an action.
        $AuthLDAPBindDN    For sites using  AuthUser  with LDAP authentication, this specifies the distinguished name (DN) to be used to bind to the LDAP server to check identity.
        $AuthLDAPBindPassword    For  AuthUser  with LDAP authentication, this specifies the password used for binding (in conjunction with   $AuthLDAPBindDN   above).
        $EnablePublishAttr    Adds a new "publish" authorization level to distinguish editing of drafts from publishing - See   $EnableDrafts  .
        $EnablePageVarAuth     In PmWiki versions 2.2.22 and 2.2.23 this variable should be set to 0. In 2.2.24 it will no longer be used.
