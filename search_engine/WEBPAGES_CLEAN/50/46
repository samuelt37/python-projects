&gt; This is the idea brought up by Marty in the message
&gt; &lt; 9605291632.AA0573@ccmnotes1.cwi.com &gt; and by Jim in his proposal
&gt; on versioning, where he proposes the new content type
&gt; text/config.

I'm looking for this note but can't find it. Can you point me to
the suggestion for "text/config"?

(Is this mailing list archived/hypermailed?)
