4.137 OESuppressHydrogens 
 

 
    
bool OESuppressHydrogens(OEMolBase &amp;mol, bool retainPolar=false)
    
This function transforms the explicit hydrogens in a molecule into
implicit hydrogens on their parent heavy atom.  Any explicit hydrogen
atoms, those with atomic number  OEElemNo::H , are deleted and any
information associated with them, co-ordinates, isotopes, generic
data etc... are lost.  In their place, the implicit hydrogen count
field of the heavy atom to which they are bonded is appropriately
incremented.  If the ``retainPolar'' flag is true, then hydrogens
on polar atoms,  i.e.  those for which
 OEAtomBase::IsPolarHydrogen  returns true, are left unaffected.

  
This function returns the value true if any hydrogens were deleted,
and returns false if the molecule was left unchanged.
