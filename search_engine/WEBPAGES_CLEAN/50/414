  RFC 2068 Methods on Collections  
      GET, HEAD for collections
 
  Semantics of GET are unchanged when applied to a collection, since GET is defined as, �retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI�
  GET may return the contents of an �index.html� resource, a human-readable view of the contents of the collection, or something else altogether.
