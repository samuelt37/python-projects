   What is XLOGP?</strong>  

       The XLOGP
method is developed by   Dr. Renxiao Wang  . It is an atom-additive method for
calculating octanol/water partition coefficient (log P ).
It gives the log P  value for a given compound by summing
the contributions from component atoms and correction factors.  

     

      Here  A   i  
is the occurrence of the  i th atom type and  Bj  is
the occurrence of the  j th correction factor;  a   i   
 is the contribution of the  i th atom type and  b   j  
is the contribution of the  j th correction factor. The
coefficients are derived by multivariate regression of large
number of organic compounds.  

      Our
original work on XLOGP is published   on      J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.   1997 ,
 37 , 615-621  .  
XLOGP v1.1 was released to the public in September, 1997. Since
then, we have improved the XLOGP algorithm to version 2.0. In the
current version, totally 90 atom types are used to classify
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, and halogen atoms.
Ten additional correction factors are also applied to deal with
some special chemical structures. Compared to its previous
version, XLOGP v2.0 is more robust and gives better statistical
results. The comparison of various log P  calculation
procedures demonstrates that our method gives much better results
than other atom-additive approaches and is at least comparable to
some popular fragmental approaches like CLOGP. Because of the
simple methodology, missing fragment problem does not
occur to our method.

      We have
prepared a manuscript describing the algorithm of XLOGP v2.0 in
detail and have submitted it to  Perspectives in Drug Design
and Discovery.  It will be available to the users soon.
