  Conclusions  
      Investigated Approaches to Reducing Cost of Misclassifications
 
     Introduced Reduced Cost Ordering Algorithm for creating a decision list from unordered rules
 
     Introduced Clause Prefix Strategy for overfitting avoidance
 
     Reduced Cost Ordering works with knowledge-intensive approaches
 
     When assumptions of Bayesian Classifier are met, it is most accurate and reduces errors most
