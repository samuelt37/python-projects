In detail, pairwise two-tailed t-tests indicate that there are ten data sets (balance, breast, cleveland, credit,  heart   iris, vehicle, waveform21, waveform40, and wine) where NeC4.5 with � = 100% is significantly more accurate than C4.5, while there is no significant       Remco R.

We can observe the result of Theorems 8 and 9 from Figure 1. The contours show five-fold cross-validation accuracy of the data set  heart  in different r and C. The contours with a = 1 are on the left-hand side, while those with a = 0.01 are on the right-hand side. Other parameters considered here are log 2 C fromlog 2 (- r) from       Alexander K. Seewald.

This is the case with the  heart  disease data set (HeartD in Table 2) where significant improvement is achieved by the neural network methods over C4.5. There is no significant difference in the accuracy and size of the decision trees generated by
