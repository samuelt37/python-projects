              Abstract   
We explore the potential of anytime best-first search schemes for combinatorial
optimization tasks over graphical models (e.g., MAP/MPE). We show that recent
advances in extending best-first search into an anytime scheme have a potential for
optimization for graphical models. Importantly, these schemes come with upper
bound guarantees and are sometime competitive with known effective anytime
branch-and-bound schemes.
