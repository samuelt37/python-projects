Fast Force-Directed Graph Drawing Using the Well-Separated Pair Decomposition
 
 
Tim Johnson
 

 
Abstract: We first revisit the algorithm for computing the
well-separated pair decomposition in time O(n log n). Then we show how
this algorithm can be used to give a faster approximation to the
Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for force-directed graph drawing.
Finally, we provide experimental evidence that this does not affect
the quality of the results.
