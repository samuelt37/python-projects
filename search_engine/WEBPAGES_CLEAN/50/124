virtual bool IsRotor() const
    
Determine whether a bond is freely rotatable.  The definition of a
freely rotatable bond is that it is a single, non-ring bond between
two non-terminal, non-triple-bonded atoms.  An atom is considered
non-terminal if it is connected to two or more non-hydrogen atoms,
 i.e.   OEAtomBase::GetHvyDegree &gt;= 2 .  Note that the
``in ring'' property of the bond must have previously been set using the
 OEBondBase::SetInRing  method, typically by calling the function
 OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds .
