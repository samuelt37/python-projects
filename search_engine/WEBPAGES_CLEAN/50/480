  Patented Applications of Computational Geometry 

Some of the following patents are applications of geometric algorithms,
while others appear to patent the algorithms themselves.
Presumably I have missed many more than I have found.

     US 
Patent 3602702  covers the quadtree subdivision of a viewing plane to perform hidden surface removal in computer graphics.
 Patent 4694404  covers the use of octrees to implement a nearer-object-first
painting order.
 Patent 5123084  describes a similar nearest-first octree graphics method.
 Patent
5222201  also concerns octree graphics methods, and describes
a heuristic for speeding up the conversion of objects into octree
representations.
 
    US
Patent 3889107  covers the use of binary space partitions for hidden
surface removal, shadow calculation, and collision detection.
 
    US
Patent 4704694  uses convex hulls to recognize objects from video images.
 
    US
Patent 4862373  is an early patent on robot motion planning
algorithms, referenced by many later patents on the same subject.
 
    US
Patent 4941114  covers an ear-cutting method of constructing
unstructured triangular meshes.  Another meshing patent,
 5214752 ,
describes an incremental point placement algorithm very similar to the
provably-good meshing method of one of its inventors (Jim Ruppert).
 Patent
5440674  appears to be based on a very similar incremental method of Chew.
Meshing patents
 4797842  and
 4933889 
are based on medial axes.
 Patent
5315537  covers a wavefront-based quadrilateral meshing system.
 Patent
5345490  covers quadtree- and octree-based meshing.
 Patent
553206  describes methods of merging tetrahedra to simplify meshes.
 
    US
Patent 5054098  describes a method of detecting whether a scanned
image has been turned at an angle from the original, using an algorithm
for finding minimum enclosing rectangles along with other techniques.
 
    US
Patent 5086482  seems to cover gift-wrapping methods of computing convex hulls in bitmap images.
 
    US
Patent 5115479  covers the compression of bitmap data by using spline
curves to represent the image outlines.  Isn't that what standard font
formats already did?
 
    US
Patent 5129051  covers a slab method of performing trapezoidal
decomposition and its application to scan-line conversion in computer graphics
( Patent
4791582 ).
 Patent 5276783  is also on slab-based trapezoidalization.
 Patent
5020002  is harder to
decode; it seems to be describing an ear-cutting trapezoidalization method.
 
   US Patents
 5134480 ,
 5228098 ,
 5444489 ,
 5446806 ,
 5452104 ,
and
 5469212 
describe video and image coding methods based on quadtrees.
 
    US
Patent 5159645  performs character recognition by using convex hulls
to find the counters in each character. A similar idea also occurs in 
 Patent
4817166 .
 
    US
Patent 5211692  covers a decorative tiling pattern based on the
geometry of zonohedra. Patents
 5155951  and
 5448868  cover similar three-dimensional building systems.
 
    US Patent 5268998  seems to cover graphical display of objects in non-Euclidean or higher dimensional geometries.
 
   US Patents
 5317681  and
 5428717  cover methods for finding convex hulls of
polyhedra based on flipping reflex edges, along with an animated version
of this procedure that creates a smooth morph of the polyhedron to its hull.
 
    US
Patent 5459831  covers the use of quadtrees to perform the range
queries needed for object selection in graphical user interfaces.
 
    US
Patent 5461712  uses quadtrees to allocate memory to different
objects in a windowing system.
 
    US
Patent 5463721  describes the use of convex hulls in a method for finding a
path for a radiation-beam scanner so it can get enough data
to reconstruct object shapes. Patents
 4888693 ,
 4969110 ,
and
 5053958 
also use convex hulls for computerized tomography.
 
    US
Patent 5465221  describes a part inspection system including the use
of convex hulls to determine stable orientations.
 
    US
Patent 5483606  describes a method of registering (lining up) copied
pages with each other in a copying machine, using the convex hulls of
images of the pages.
 
   US
Patents
 5506784 ,
 5510994 ,
and
 5541847 
use medial axes to generate embroidery patterns.
 
    US
Patent 5564004  uses Voronoi diagrams as part of a user interface
that highlights the icon nearest the cursor in a windowing system.
 
    US
Patent 5574835  describes a method of performing visibility checking
of polygons by intersecting bounding boxes.
