   FQ00 ICS 229 Softalks Schedule 
 
  What's New 
  [9/26] For those of you unfamiliar with this class (most of you): ICS 229 
    is a seminar in which YOU make all the presentations.  
    Students in past years have presented a wide variety of things: some students 
    use the class as a forum in which to give a "dry run" of a presentation they'll 
    be making at a conference. Some have used it as a way of getting ready for 
    their Phase II oral exam by presenting their survey paper. First year grad 
    students are usually in the most difficult spot: you're just starting your 
    graduate student career, so what do you present? Probably a best answer is: 
    present a technical paper that you believe to be both interesting and significant 
    --- something you think everyone else would be interested in. If you need 
    help in identifying an appropriate paper I can make several suggestions. A 
    great place to start is the Phase II reading list:  
    http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/phaseII_reading_list.html    
    Attendance in the seminar is mandatory (I will take attendance) and you MUST 
    make a presentation sometime during the quarter.   
    The purpose of the first meeting (tomorrow's) is simply to set up the schedule 
    for the rest of the quarter. The class will be over by 2:25. So --- think 
    about what you'd like to present, or at a minimum, WHEN you would like to 
    make a presentation. We'll put names to dates and then we'll be done. You 
    do not have to commit to a specific topic tomorrow, just a specific date.  
   [9/25] Web site opened.
