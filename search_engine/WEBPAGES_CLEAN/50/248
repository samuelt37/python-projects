 Abstract 
   
Many applications employ sensors for monitoring entities 
such as temperature and wind speed.  A centralized 
database tracks these entities to enable query processing.
Due to continuous changes in these values and limited resources (e.g., 
network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible to store
the exact values at all times.
A similar situation exists for 
moving object environments that track the constantly changing locations of objects.
In this environment, it is possible for database queries to produce incorrect or invalid 
results based upon old data.  However, if the degree of error (or uncertainty) between
the actual value and the database value is controlled, we can place more confidence in 
the answers to queries. 
More generally, query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates
of the validity of the answers.  In this paper we study probabilistic query evaluation
based upon uncertain data. A classification of queries is made based upon the nature
of the result set. For each class, we develop algorithms for computing probabilistic 
answers.  We address the important issue of measuring the quality of 
the answers to these queries, and provide algorithms for efficiently pulling data from 
relevant sensors or moving objects in order to improve the quality of the executing queries. 
Extensive experiments are performed to examine the effectiveness of several data update 
policies.
