    Java Code to Flow Diagram Converter 


 
   
    October 2009 to March 2010
   
  
   Developed an Eclipse Plug-in to statically reverse engineer a selected Java code snippet, to corresponding Sequence Diagram. Recursive parsing of Abstract Syntax Tree of code was done to derive chronological ordering of method invocations, thus accurately depicting Program Flow. 

 

  TL;DR  - An eclipse plug-in that can statically reverse engineer Java code snippets to Sequence Diagrams.
