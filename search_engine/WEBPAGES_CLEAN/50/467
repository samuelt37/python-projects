 ICS Degree Minor Information 

 
 

 The minor in Information and Computer Sciences provides a focused study of Information and Computer Science to supplement a student's major program of study and prepares students for a profession, career, or academic pursuit in which computer science is an integral part but is not the primary focus.  
 The ICS minor contributes to students' competence in computing technology and proficiency in programming as well as exposing them to the fundamentals of computer science.  
 The minor allows students sufficient flexibility to pursue courses that complement their major field or address specific interests.
