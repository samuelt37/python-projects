 Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables 
 Joe Simons, UC Irvine 

 We present a version of the Bloom filter data structure that supports
not only the insertion, deletion, and lookup of key-value pairs, but
also allows a complete listing of its contents with high probability, as
long the number of key-value pairs is below a designed threshold. Our
structure allows the number of key-value pairs to greatly exceed this
threshold during normal operation. Exceeding the threshold simply
temporarily prevents content listing and reduces the probability of a
successful lookup. If later entries are deleted to return the structure
below the threshold, everything again functions appropriately. We also
show that simple variations of our structure are robust to certain
standard errors, such as the deletion of a key without a corresponding
insertion or the insertion of two distinct values for a key. The
properties of our structure make it suitable for several applications,
including database and networking applications that we highlight.
