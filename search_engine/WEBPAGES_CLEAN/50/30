Codifying Policies

  

       Web�s �trust problems� are too varied to compile in
 

      PICS filtering, applet authorization; soon payment method selection and privacy policy negotiation
         Externalized policy evaluators
 

      More flexible to put in a general-purpose TM Engine
  Possible to compose policies written in several languages and styles
  Example: REFEREE can load in policy interpreters as well as policies, rather than PICSRulz alone       --&gt;
