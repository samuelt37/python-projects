 Abstract  
Haralick and Elliott's full looking ahead algorithm [4] was presented in
the same article as forward checking, but is not as commonly used. We
give experimental results which indicate that on some types of constraint
satisfaction problems, full looking ahead outperforms forward checking.
We also present three new looking ahead algorithms, all variations on full
looking ahead, which were designed with the goal of achieving performance
equal to the better of forward checking and full looking ahead on a variety of
constraint satisfaction problems. One of these new algorithms, called smart
looking ahead, comes close to achieving our goal.
