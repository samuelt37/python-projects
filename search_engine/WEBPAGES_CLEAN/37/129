  Collections  
      A collection is a set of URIs listing the member resources
 
  A resource may have more than one URI/URL, hence a resource may be accessible via more than one collection.
       Advanced Collections specification defines ordered collections:
 
  The server persistently stores a single ordering of the resources in a collection.
  A listing of the members of a collection returns the resources in that order.
