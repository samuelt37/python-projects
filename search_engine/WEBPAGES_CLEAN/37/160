 Pure Glider Reactions 

There are many ways of colliding two gliders so both vanish: 

     

 These vanishing reactions can be used as sparks for other
reactions, or to form  glider logic 
circuits. There are also several ways of colliding two gliders so
that only one glider results: 

     

 These reactions can be used to position gliders for another
reaction, to synchronize glider logic streams, or to
nondestructively test for the presence of a glider. The reactions
in which two head-on gliders produce a sideways glider should be
especially useful in building glider salvos by setting up pairs of
guns on opposite sides of the salvo track; this reaction is also
used in my  delay line  construction. 

 Less useful curiosities are reactions in which two head-on
gliders turn into two sideways gliders, and in which four gliders
become six or six become eight. (However the first reaction could
be used for duplicating glider streams, and the second forms the
basis of the  p216 gun .)
