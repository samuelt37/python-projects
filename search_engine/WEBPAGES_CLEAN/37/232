&gt;Three ways of making that a convention would be:
&gt;
&gt;a.  The explict:   http://www.foo.com/a/b/version=_verions_/morestuff 
&gt;
&gt;    In this case, the version is identified by a specially marked path
&gt;    element.  The path element could be anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;b.  The implicit:  http://www.foo.com/_version_/morestuff 
&gt;
&gt;    Here the first element implicitly denotes the version.  This is a
&gt;    bit like the way Atria uses their view-extended path names: the
&gt;    first element is the view (which selects the the versions), and
&gt;    subsequent elements are interpreted according to that view.
&gt;
&gt;c.  The hidden:    http://www.foo.com/a/b/_version_/morestuff 
&gt;
&gt;    Here the version, just as with The Economist, is simply an
&gt;    indistinguishable part of the path.  No one knows, except for
&gt;    the version-controlled server.

Again we use a convention as follows:
         http://www.foo.com/entity/_version_ 

This is because a version of an entity may consist of different versions
of component entities.  Generally speaking, each constituent of
configuration layers may have different version schemas and numbers.  For
example, version 3 of an entire document consists of version 4 of
a component and version 5 of another component.

Kenji
