 Changing the System:  Funding the Proposals<body>
  Spring 2013 —  UC Irvine  —  Information &amp; Computer Science  —  ICS 139W  —  David G. Kay   
   Changing the System: </strong>You make the funding decisions  
  As you listen to your classmates' proposals,
  decide which proposal(s) are most effective.  Pretend that you work for
  a foundation or venture capital company with a budget of $3,500,000 to spend
  on funding system changes, according to these guidelines:   
   We will treat the two days separately, with $1,600,000 for the 16 speakers
    on Thursday and $1,900,000 for the 19 speakers on Tuesday   
    Each day, you may spend all of your budget on one proposal or split it
    among many   
    You may not spend any on your own proposal   
    The amount you spend should indicate how effective you think the proposal
    is—a combination of how good the ideas are and how well they are presented.
    Don't take into account the actual dollar cost of implementing the
    proposal, or how well you know the person making the presentation.   
  
   We will accumulate the results and report them back to you.  This is for
  interest and information only; the results will have no effect on anyone's
  course grade (but turning in this form is required).
