 Welcome to the webpage for Prof. Alexander Ihler's Statistical Learning and Inference group at UCI.
 
 We are interested in using probabilistic models to represent and understand real-world phenomena, using approximation algorithms to estimate probabilistic quantities efficiently, and learning probabilistic models from data.  We focus primarily on algorithms for learning and estimation in  graphical models , with applications to  sensor networks ,  data mining , image processing and computer vision, and computational biology.
