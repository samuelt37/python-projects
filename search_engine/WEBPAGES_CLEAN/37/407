  Advanced User Interface Architecture (4).   Architectural concerns
  in advanced interactive systems. The design of current and emerging platforms
  for novel interactive systems. Paradigms such as constraint-based
  programming, multimodal interaction, and perceptual user interfaces for
  individual, distributed, and ubiquitous applications.  
         
    Informal Course
  Description    
       
   This course will focus primarily on the architecture of
  different kinds of user interfaces to software systems. Keeping the �human in
  the loop� is a key to all of these. But there are a great variety of systems,
  usually with different architectural considerations and software
  implementation platforms. Natural language interfaces, text-based systems,
  groupware, knowledge-based systems, tutoring systems�all have differences
  that we will explore. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Policies

    Academic honesty:  Please
  familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy:  http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm .
  The consequences of academic dishonesty are not worth the risks. 
       
    Announcements:  Please
  check the announcements link of the class Web page regularly. Emergency
  announcements will be made using the official mailing list, so make sure your
  UCI (name@uci.edu) login is functioning and that you check it daily. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Course Mechanics and
  Grading    
       
   Students will implement a user interface software project
  over the course of the quarter. They will participate in at least three
  presentations about this project. The first presentation will be a
  description of their project idea. The second will be a detailed description
  (possibly as a collaborative presentation) of the implementation platform for
  the project. The third presentation will be the final presentation of the
  project. The project will need to be documented appropriately according to
  the developers' and users' perspectives. 
       
   Generally, class will consist one-half to three-quarters
  of discussion of a paper or papers with the remainder of the class focusing
  on discussion of students' projects and status.
