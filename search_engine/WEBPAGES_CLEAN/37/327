    Abstraction and Encapsulation 

    The notion of a class represents software engineering principles and lessons learned from structured methods  A class consists of two parts  The interface part, that can be seen and used by other entities in the system  The implementation part, that is hidden from the rest of the system    Hiding the implementation details of a class/object is called information hiding or encapsulation  Encapsulation offers two kinds of protection  It protects an objectï¿½s internal state from corruption by its clients  It protects client code from being affected by changes to the internal representation and/or implementation of an object
