        On the Practical Significance of Hypertree vs. Tree Width.

              Abstract   

The recently introduced notion of hypertree width has
been shown to provide a broader characterization of tractable constraint
and probabilistic networks than the tree width. This paper
demonstrates empirically that in practice the bounding power of the
tree width is still superior to the hypertree width for many benchmark
instances of both probabilistic and deterministic networks.
