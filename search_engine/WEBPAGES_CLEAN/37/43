class OEExprBase
    
OEExprBase is an abstract class which defines an interface through
which boolean expressions can test equivalence of nodes (atoms) and
edges (bonds) during graph match processes.  The expression class
interface simplifies what is normally a binary tree representation of
attributes which atoms and bonds must (not) have in order to be called
equivalent to a corresponding node or edge.  Derived classes may be
used to extend the graph matching algorithms in OEChem to compare
attributes beyond the pre-defined expressions in OEChem.  In addition,
user-defined expression classes may take full advantage of the
arbitrary data storage mechanism which is part of the OEBase class.
Expression equivalence could then be performed on dynamic user-defined
data extensions to atoms and bonds.
