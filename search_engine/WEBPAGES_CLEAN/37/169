Cache-Concious Sorting of Large Sets of Strings with Dynamic Tries
 
Josiah Carlson
 
 
The authors present an algorithm for sorting strings that betters
previously known string sorting algorithms by a factor of at least 2,
for large input sets.  During the presentation, I'll be outlining a few
often-used algorithms for string sorting, provide the algorithm designed
by Sinha and Zobel, and give the findings of their experimental results.
