    Problem C-8.1 from Goodrich-Tamassia.  
  Problem R-13.3 from Goodrich-Tamassia.  
  
Define
SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM as the problem that takes a graph,  G , and
another graph,  H , and determines if  H  
is isomoprhic to a subgraph of  G .
That is, the problem is to determine whether there is a one-to-one mapping, 
 f , of the vertices in  H  to a subset of the vertices
in  G  such that, if ( v,w ) is an edge in 
 H , then (  f ( v ),  f ( w )) is an edge
in  G . Show that
SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM is NP-complete.

   Problem C-13.8 from Goodrich-Tamassia.  
  Problem C-13.12 from Goodrich-Tamassia.
