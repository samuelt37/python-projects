  Windowing Systems and User Interface Programming 

The rectangular geometry of most windowing user interfaces lends itself
naturally to the orthogonal range searching techniques studied in
computational geometry.  A typical problem arising in this context might
be to find a data structure for quickly determining which window or
window system object is topmost at a given screen pixel (for instance
this information is needed to process mouse clicks and to set the
mouse's appearance).  Range searching techniques can be useful even
within a single window, to speed up scrolling and redisplay by
determining which objects are visible in a region.  In my own
programming experience, I have used (a simplified implementation of)
interval trees to greatly speed up scrolling in code for displaying
large family trees.
