It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal
version.
