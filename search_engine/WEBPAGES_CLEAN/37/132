  Typical Interaction of a Chimera client (non-Applet)  

 This section demonstrates the interactions of various elements of Chimera's
architecture in supporting a client's access to a Chimera hyperweb. 

           Step one.  The client contacts the Chimera server executing within
its local-area network. It  discovers  the Chimera server by locating
the server's information file in the user's home directory. This file contains
the server's hostname and port number.          Step two.  Either the the user via the Chimera server's user-interface,
or a client via the Chimera API, specifies a URL which references a Chimera-enhanced
website. The Chimera server contacts the hyperweb manager and requests the
contact information for the site's hyperweb server.          Step three.  Having retrieved the contact information for the hyperweb
server, the Chimera server establishes a connection to it. At this point,
the Chimera server requests a list of the hyperwebs contained on the site
from the hyperweb manager. It can then present this list to the user or
pass it back to the client.          Step four.  Once the user or client has selected a hyperweb, the hyperweb
server loads it into memory and it is now accessible by all of the user's
clients.           Local Site Map
