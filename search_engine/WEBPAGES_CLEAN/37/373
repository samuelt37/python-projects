  CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_S2&lt;Traits&gt;::Sphere_point  
 

  Definition 
 

An object  p  of type  Sphere_point&lt;R&gt;  is a point on the
surface of a unit sphere. Such points correspond to the nontrivial
directions in space and similarly to the equivalence classes of all
nontrivial vectors under normalization.
  

  Types 
 

    
          Nef_polyhedron_S2&lt;Traits&gt;::Sphere_point ::RT
         
              
    ring number type.
 

     

  Creation 
 

    
          Nef_polyhedron_S2&lt;Traits&gt;::Sphere_point  p;
         
              
    creates some sphere point.
 

          
          Nef_polyhedron_S2&lt;Traits&gt;::Sphere_point  p ( RT x,  RT y,  RT z);
         
              
    creates a sphere
  point corresponding to the point of  intersection  of the ray starting
  at the origin in direction  (x,y,z)  and the surface of  S 2  .
 

     

  Operations 
 

Access to the coordinates is provided by the following operations.
Note that the vector  (x,y,z)  is not normalized.

    p.x ()
         
          
    the  x -coordinate.
                 
           
RT
         
          
         
    p.y ()

    p.z ()
         
          
    the  z -coordinate.
                 
         
    bool
