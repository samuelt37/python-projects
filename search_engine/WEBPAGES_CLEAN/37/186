  Lesson 5 - Copyright 4:  
  "Copying" Covers Many Kinds Of Copying  
  
Copyright, as we saw, generally gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to make copies of a work.  Copies include electronic copies, and copyrighted works include electronic works.  
But what does "copy" mean?  
   It covers copies of LESS THAN THE WHOLE thing:  If you write an article and I make a copy of five pages,  that might violate your copyright. 
   It covers PARAPHRASES, so long as they're close  enough:  If I translate your article into a foreign  language, or make a movie based on your book, that will  probably violate your copyright. 
   It covers MANUAL copies as well as mechanical copies:  It doesn't matter whether you make an electronic copy  of an electronic document, scan in a print document, or  hand-enter a document into the computer.  All of this is copying. 
   It covers PERSONAL copying as well as BUSINESS copying.
