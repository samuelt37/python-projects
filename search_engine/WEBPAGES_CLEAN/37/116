Multi-Pivot Quicksort: Theory and Experiments
 
 
Timothy Johnson
 

 
The idea of multi-pivot quicksort has recently received the attention of
researchers after Vladimir Yaroslavskiy proposed a dual pivot quicksort
algorithm that, contrary to prior intuition, outperforms standard
quicksort by a significant margin under the Java JVM. More recently,
this algorithm has been analysed in terms of comparisons and swaps by
Wild and Nebel. Our contributions to the topic are as follows. First, we
perform the previous experiments using a native C implementation thus
removing potential extraneous effects of the JVM. Second, we provide
analyses on cache behavior of these algorithms. We then provide strong
evidence that cache behavior is causing most of the performance
differences in these algorithms. Additionally, we build upon prior work
in multi-pivot quicksort and propose a 3-pivot variant that performs
very well in theory and practice. We show that it makes fewer
comparisons and has better cache behavior than the dual pivot quicksort
in the expected case. We validate this with experimental results,
showing a 7–8% performance improvement in our tests.
