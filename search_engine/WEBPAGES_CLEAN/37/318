10.5 Making Hydrogen Atoms Explicit 
 

 
Implicit hydrogens contained in a molecule can be made explicit using
one of the overloaded  OEAddExplicitHydrogens  functions.
Implicit hydrogens may be made explicit for only a single atom of a
molecule.  The  OEAddExplicitHydrogens  functions which take
either a single or multi-conformer conformer molecule as an argument
convert either polar or all implicit hydrogens into explicit
hydrogens.  These functions take an argument which specifies whether
energetically reasonable geometries should be assigned for the newly
added hydrogens.  If this option is not desired, the Cartesian
coordinates of the sprouted hydrogens will be assigned to the
coordinates of the parent atom to which they are attached.
