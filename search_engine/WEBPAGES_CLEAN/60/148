We apply techniques from " Quadrilateral meshing
by circle packing " to a magic trick of Houdini:
fold a piece of paper so that with one straight cut, you can form your
favorite polygon.

    The distribution of cycle lengths in graphical models for iterative decoding .  X. Ge ,
D. Eppstein, and
 P. Smyth .  arXiv:cs.DM/9907002 .  Tech.
Rep. 99-10 , ICS, UCI, 1999.  IEEE Int. Symp. Information
Theory , Sorrento, Italy, 2000.  IEEE Trans. Information Theory  47 (6): 2549–2553, 2001.
 
We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.
Note, the TR, conference, and journal versions of this paper have
slightly different titles.

    Tangent spheres and triangle centers . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/9909152 .   Amer. Math. Monthly  108 (1): 63–66, 2001 .
 
Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .

    Computing the depth of a flat .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0009024 .  
 12th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Washington, 2001, pp. 700–701 .
 
We compute the  regression depth  of a k-flat
in a set of n d-dimensional
points, in time O(n d-2 ), an order of magnitude faster than
the best known algorithms for computing the depth of a point or of a
hyperplane.
The results from this conference paper have been merged into the full
version of
" Multivariate Regression Depth ".

    Internet packet filter management and rectangle geometry . 
D. Eppstein and S. Muthukrishnan.  arXiv:cs.CG/0010018 .  
 12th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Washington, 2001, pp. 827–835 .
 
Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,
and find an O(n 3/2 ) time algorithm for testing whether
a rule set contains any ambiguities.

    Small maximal independent sets and faster exact graph coloring .

(special issue for WADS'01) 7 (2): 131–140, 2003 .
 
We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

    Optimal Möbius transformations for information visualization
and meshing .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0101006 .   7th Worksh. Algorithms and Data
Structures,  Providence, Rhode

Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  2125, 2001, pp. 14–25.
 
We give linear-time
 quasiconvex programming 
algorithms for finding a Möbius transformation of a
 set of spheres 
in a unit ball or on the
surface of a unit sphere that maximizes the minimum size of a
transformed sphere. We can also use similar methods to maximize the
minimum distance among a set of pairs of input points. We apply these
results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
 graph drawing , viewpoint selection in
 hyperbolic  browsing, and element size
control in conformal structured
 mesh generation .

    Hinged kite mirror dissection . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0106032 .
 
We show that any polygon can be cut into kites, connected into a chain
by hinges at their vertices, and that this hinged assemblage can be
unfolded and refolded to form the mirror image of the polygon.

    Topological issues in hexahedral meshing . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at
 Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science , Stanford, 2001.
 
We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

    Flipping cubical meshes .  M. Bern 
D. Eppstein, and

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.  Engineering with Computers  18 (3): 173–187, 2002.
 
We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Erickson was added as a co-author during the revisions for the journal version.

    Triangles and squares . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at EuroConf. Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Applications,
Bellaterra, Spain, 2001, p. 114.
 
Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

    Separating geometric thickness from book thickness . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0109195 .
 
We show that  geometric thickness 
and book thickness are not
asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
geometric thickness two and book thickness  &gt;   t .

    The minimum expectation selection problem . 
D. Eppstein and
 G. Lueker . 
10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.  arXiv:cs.DS/0110011 .  
 Random Structures and Algorithms  21: 278–292, 2002 .
 
We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

    Global optimization of mesh quality . 
D. Eppstein. 
Tutorial at
10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.
 
Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.
