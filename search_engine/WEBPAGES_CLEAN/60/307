VHDL Reference Guide - Exit Statement 
   Exit Statement  
       Sequential Statement 
 ---- used in ----&gt; 
 Loop For Loop While Loop 
          Syntax       
  

 
    exit;
  
   
  

 
    
exit loop_label;
  
   
  

 
    
exit loop_label when condition;
  
   
  

 
See LRM section 8.10

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
   The exit statement is used to terminate a  while, for  or
infinite  loop :
 for I in 0 to 7 loop
  if FINISH_LOOP_EARLY = '1' then
    exit;
  else
    A_BUS   
   
  

 
   The exit statement may test a boolean condition directly using the
 when  keyword
 process (A)
   variable I : integer range 0 to 4; 
begin
   Z   
   
  

 
   For an exit statement within a set of nested loops, the optional
loop label may be used to indicate which level of loop is to be exited.
The default (no label) is the innermost loop:
 L1: for I in 0 to 7 loop
  L2: for J in 0 to 7 loop
    exit L1 when QUIT_BOTH_LOOPS = '1';
    exit when QUIT_INNER_LOOP = '1';
    -- other statements 
  end loop L2;
end loop L1;  
   
  

 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

The exit statement is supported by some logic synthesis tools, with
certain restrictions.

 
        Whats New in '93       

In  VHDL -93, the  exit  statement may have an optional label
  label:  exit  loop_label;
