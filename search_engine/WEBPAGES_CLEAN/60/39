Deriving greedy algorithms and Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms
 

 Neal Young, UC-Riverside 

 
 Abstract: 
  
We will discuss how one can use randomized rounding to systematically
derive primal-dual algorithms  --- particularly greedy algorithms and
Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms --- for approximately solving
packing and covering problems such as set cover, vertex cover, and
multi-commodity flow.  The talk should be of interest to those
interested in probabilistic methods and to those interested in
approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.
