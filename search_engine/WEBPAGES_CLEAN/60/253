    Text:      
There is one required textbook for the course:  

  Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, 
Fifth Edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen (McGraw-Hill 1999).  

  The textbook explains the subject material in
detail. It is strongly recommended that you read the book. It is strongly
recommended that you read the book and attend all lectures and all meetings of
your discussion section. You will be responsible for all material covered in
the lectures and discussion sections, and for all assigned reading in the book.
This course requires no programming.  

    Course Grades:     
There will be 7-8 homework and 7-8 quizzes. Homework will be assigned each
Thursday and will be due on Thursday the following week. Quizzes will be given
every Thursday at the beginning of class. There will be one midterm and one
final. The grading criteria for the course are:  

  Homework assignments 15% 
Quizzes 35% 
Midterm 20% 
Final 30%  

  We will drop the lowest 2 quiz scores and the
two lowest homework score in determining your final grade. The midterm exam
will be given in lecture. It is scheduled for  Thursday May 19 . The final
examination is scheduled for TBA.  

  These are guidelines intended to help
students plan their work in this course. However, the instructor does reserve
the right to make changes in these evaluation criteria.  

  A work-related conflict is NOT a valid reason
for postponing an examination. The dates of the examination are being announced
now. Plan accordingly.  

  Please bring your student ID to all
examinations.  

    Obtaining Assistance:     
The best way to get your questions answered is by coming to lecture, discussion
or office hours and asking them there.  

  Any student who feels he or she may need an
accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately
to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact the DisabilityServicesCenter at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.  

    Announcements:     
Class announcements will be made in lecture and in discussion. Important
announcements will also be posted on the class Web page. The Web page will
contain the most up-to-date course information. Any corrections or additional explanations
for the homework assignments will also be posted there, so please check the Web
page occasionally to stay up to date.  

    Homework and Handouts:     
The homework assignments are regularly posted on the Web.  

  Some homework problems may be difficult. Homework
that is turned in should be legible and well-written. A badly written, poorly
presented solution to a problem is of little value even if it happens to be
correct.  

  The homework problems are an integral part of
the course. They complement the material covered in the lectures by providing
examples, applications, and extensions. You are strongly encouraged to attempt
all problems. Even if you cannot solve them, if you have tried hard to solve
them you may be more likely to understand and remember the solution. Our brains
learn something while attempting to solve a problem, even (and perhaps
especially) during failed attempts. So do not get discouraged if a problem is
difficult.  

    Discussion Section:     
You must be registered for a discussion section. The discussion section
provides you with an opportunity to ask questions about the lecture material.
It is strongly recommended that you attend a discussion section regularly. You
are responsible for all material covered there.  

   

  3.   Course Policies      (back to top)   

     Late Assignments:   
Homework assignments are due every Thursday by 3:00 PM in the distribution center. Absolutely no homework
assignments will be accepted after 3:00
 PM. If your homework is not turned by then, you will receive a 0.  

  There will be a quiz given every Thursday at
the beginning of lecture. The quiz will be handed out at 3:30 PM, sharp and will be picked up at 3:45 PM, sharp. When we tabulate
your final grade, we will drop the two lowest quiz scores and the two lowest
homework scores. However, in exchange for this, we well make absolutely no
allowances if you arrive at a quiz late or turn in your homework late. This
holds even if you have a perfectly valid reason to miss a homework assignment
or a quiz. If for some reason you fail to make it to a quiz or hand in a
homework assignment, that will count as one of your dropped quizzes or homework
assignments, no matter how legitimate your reason is.  

    Grading:     
Only parts of the homework assignments will be graded. However, you will not
know which particular problems will be graded before you hand in your
assignment.  

    Questions on Grading:     
For any questions regarding grades, please contact the TA during his office
hours or at the end of the discussion sections.  

    Collaboration:     
You are allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss the solutions to the homework
with your fellow classmates. However, you are required to sit down and write up
your own solutions independently. In addition, you need to write down the names
of any classmates with whom you have collaborated on a given assignment,
clearly indicating that they are your collaborators. Copying the homework
assignment of another student is considered cheating. Keep in mind that the
homework contributes little to your final grade in comparison to the quizzes.
Thus, it is very much in your own best interest to have a thorough
understanding of the homework assignments before the quiz.  

    Academic Honesty:     
All work done on quizzes, midterms and finals should be your own work. Cheating
on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously. Any such
incident will result in a letter describing the incident which is placed in
your file on campus. Depending on the severity of the incident, the resulting
grade can range from an F on the particular examination to an automatic F in
the course. Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the
university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in
suspension or expulsion from the university.  

    ICS Change of Grade Option Policy:     
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to change their grade option is
the end of 6th week with instructor's approval. Dean's signature (available at
the ICS Student Affairs office) will be required after the deadline and the ICS
Student Affairs office does not allow a change of grade option for any course
after 6th week, unless the student has documented a medical or financial
hardship.  

    ICS Add Deadline:     
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to add an ICS course is the end
of 3rd week with instructor's approval. Any course additions after the 3rd week
of classes requires Dean's signature and careful review by the ICS Student
Affairs office. If you are adding a course after the 3rd week, please go to the
ICS Student Affairs office.
