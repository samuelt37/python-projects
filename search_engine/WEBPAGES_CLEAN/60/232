					 The first room encountered at EVOKE is the Studio space – a gloriously huge “big black box” previously inhabited by the UCI Theater &amp; Dance Department. This is where we do our primary building of projects that have taken shape in the Lab, and get to the work of making our ideas physical and presentable. The Studio is where the 3D printing facilities live, as well as the video and audio editing stations. We have a large green screen and floor mat for filming, a high-powered projector and large screen for demonstrations and video-based telecommunication, and ample floor space for exhibitions, performances, presentations, and meetings. The Studio activities turn over rapidly, and students frequently come in to study, hang out, co-design, and tinker with our various technologies for building evocative projects! Stop in and see what we have going on in the EVOKE Studio!
