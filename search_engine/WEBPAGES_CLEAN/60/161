        Memory Intensive AND/OR Search for Combinatorial Optimization in Graphical Models

              Abstract   

In this paper we explore the impact of caching during search in the context of the recent
framework of AND/OR search in graphical models. Specifically, we extend the depth-first
AND/OR Branch-and-Bound tree search algorithm to explore an AND/OR search graph
by equipping it with an adaptive caching scheme similar to good and no-good recording.
Furthermore, we present best-first search algorithms for traversing the same underlying
AND/OR search graph and compare both algorithms empirically. We focus on two common
optimization problems in graphical models: finding the Most Probable Explanation
(MPE) in belief networks and solving Weighted CSPs (WCSP). In an extensive empirical
evaluation we demonstrate conclusively the superiority of the memory intensive AND/OR
search algorithms on a variety of benchmarks.
