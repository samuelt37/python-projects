			   Researchers at the Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction (LUCI) are interested in the challenges of designing, using and understanding the elements of a ubiquitous computing world. Some of these different facets include computing in the face of mobile computers and mobile users, understanding and exploring new patterns of socio-technical behavior, and the design and construction of technology which supports ubiquitous computing.
