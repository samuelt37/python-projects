Welcome to the COPPER Project Group at UCI.
Our group consists of four faculty members and five graduate
students.
The goal of COPPER project is to build and demonstrate a capability in
hardware (processor-memory) and software (compilers) for management of
power resources and its tradeoff against speed, accuracy and
throughput needs.
For specific information, we welcome you to browse through our web pages.
