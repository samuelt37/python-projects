3.2 Reading Molecules with Iterators 
 

 
An additional way of reading molecules in OEChem is through the use of
oemolstream iterators.  OEChem iterators syntactically resemble the  for 
loops common in most programming languages.

  
    #include "oechem.h"

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace OESystem;

int main()
{
  OEIter&lt;OEMolBase&gt; mol;
  oemolistream ims;
  oemolostream oms;

  for (mol=ims.GetMolBases(); mol; ++mol)
    oms &lt;&lt; mol;
  return 0;
}

An OEChem iterator of type  OEIter&lt;T&gt; , where T is a type, such as int,
float, or OEMol, behaves like a pointer to T once it has been assigned.  In
the example above,  mol  behaves like a  OEMolBase*  during the loop.
Iterators have functions in addition to those of the iterated type.
These iterator functions include (1) that  (bool)mol  tests whether the
iterator has reached the end (for oemolstream iterators this means the end
of the file), and (2) that  ++mol  advances the iterator to the next
position.
