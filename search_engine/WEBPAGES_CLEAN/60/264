 ICS 280, Spring 1999: 
Computational Statistics 


This quarter I will be running a graduate seminar on computational statistics,
studying problems such as point estimation, regression, clustering, and
hierarchical clustering.  The course will be structured as a reading group,
with a weekly discussion meeting Wednesdays at 1:30 in CS 243.

 In the first part of the course, we'll go over various estimation
methods, with an emphasis on robustness: what sort of errors can a given
method tolerate and still provably return an accurate estimate of the data?

  In the second part, we'll read and discuss about algorithmics:
what techniques (primarily from computational geometry) can or have been
used to implement or approximate these estimators efficiently?
