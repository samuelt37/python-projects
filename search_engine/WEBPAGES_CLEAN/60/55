122 Software Design II (4). Introduction to implementation design: designing the internals of a software application. Topics include design aesthetics, design implementation, design recovery, design patterns, and component reuse. Includes practice in designing and case studies of existing designs. Prerequisite: Informatics 121.     Book  
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series, Hardcover), Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, 1995     Grades  
All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class attendance and participation, (b) assignments, (c) the final class project, and (d) team evaluations.  
Grade distribution will be as follows (as suitably adjusted with team evaluations):       Design aesthetics: 15%  
      Design implementation: 15%  
      Design patterns &amp; refactoring: 15%  
      Design recovery: 15%  
      Component review: 15%  
      Final project: 25%  
      Completing the course evaluation on EEE: 0.5% extra credit

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Please also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.     Academic Dishonesty     Academic Dishonesty will not be tolerated in any shape or form. You will be held responsible for any and all actions whether they were performed indirectly (i.e. you left your computer unmonitored, someone stole your password, you left a printed version of your work in the lab). Remember, the burden of proof is on you. The staff must solely determine that academic dishonesty has occurred, and hope that those responsible will own up to their actions. In cases where neither student admits their participation, both will receive the same sanctions on a course-level (Note: campus-wide sanctions are determined by the Associate Dean of your department). Cheating will be detected by TurnItIn.com. Please note that instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected in the final grade because dishonesty devalues the learning experience for the whole class.          Late Work  
Late work will not be accepted, except in truly extenuating circumstances for which the student can produce documentation validating their circumstance (e.g., a doctor's note, a police report, etc.)     Copyright
