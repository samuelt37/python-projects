    Software Engineering Vs. Programming 

    A Programmer writes a complete program  a software engineer writes a software component that will be combined with components written by other software engineers to build a system  the component one writes may be modified by others  it may be used by others to build different versions of the system long after one has left the project    Programming is primarily a personal activity  Software engineering is essentially a team activity    Programming is just one aspect of software development  Large software systems must be developed similar to other engineering practices
