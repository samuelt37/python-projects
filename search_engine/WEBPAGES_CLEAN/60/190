bool SetFlavor(unsigned int format, unsigned int flavor)
    
Set the file flavor for a given format associated with this input
oemolstream.  The set of unsigned integer formats are defined by the
OEFormat namespace.  The set of unsigned integer bitmasks flavors are
defined by the OEIFlavor namespace.  The current flavor can be queried
using the oemolistream::GetFlavor method.  Each format has its own specific
flavor which must be set separately.  The oemolistream constructors set the
flavors for all of the formats to their default state.
