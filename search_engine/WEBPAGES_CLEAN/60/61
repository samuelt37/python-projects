                  Golnaz Ghiasi 
				I graduated from UCI and joined Google Brain in December 2016.
				  

        		I am a Computer Science PhD student at the  University of California Irvine  and a member   
                of  Computational Vision Group  where I am advised by Prof.  Charless Fowlkes .
		 		My research interest is Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
