This function sets torsion angle defined by atoms a, b, c and d to the
angle in the argument radians.  It is presumed that each of these atoms are
members of the molecules passed to the function.  All atoms which are
attached to c (excluding b) are rotated.  If the bond defined by atoms b
and c are in a ring, no change to the torsion will occur.  However, an
overall rotation of the molecule may be a side effect.
