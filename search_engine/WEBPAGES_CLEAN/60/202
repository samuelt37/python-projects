Morphing planar graph drawings with a polynomial number of steps
 
 
Pawe≈Ç Pszona
 

 
In a follow-up to  my talk from last quarter ,
I will present an algorithm for computing a discrete
planar morph between two straight-line drawings of a graph.
This time, the algorithm maintains straight-line edges at all times.
