 Dynamic Orderings for AND/OR Branch-and-Bound Search in Graphical Models 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
AND/OR search spaces have recently been introduced as
a unifying paradigm for advanced algorithmic schemes for graphical
models. The main virtue of this representation is its sensitivity to
the structure of the model, which can translate into exponential time
savings for search algorithms. Since the variable selection can have
a dramatic impact on search performance when solving optimization
tasks, we introduce in this paper a new dynamic AND/OR Branchand-
Bound algorithmic framework which accommodates variable ordering
heuristics. The efficiency of the dynamic AND/OR approach
is demonstrated empirically in a variety of domains.
