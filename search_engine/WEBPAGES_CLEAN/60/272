        AND/OR Importance Sampling    
        Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
The paper introduces AND/OR importance sampling
for probabilistic graphical models. In contrast
to importance sampling, AND/OR importance
sampling caches samples in the AND/OR
space and then extracts a new sample mean from
the stored samples. We prove that AND/OR importance
sampling may have lower variance than
importance sampling; thereby providing a theoretical
justification for preferring it over importance
sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates
that AND/OR importance sampling is far
more accurate than importance sampling in many
cases.
