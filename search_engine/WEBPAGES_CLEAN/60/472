  Quadtrees and Hierarchical Space Decomposition 

The basic principle of a quadtree is to cover a planar region of
interest by a square, then recursively partition squares into smaller
squares until each square contains a suitably uniform subset of the
input; for instance this can be used to compress bitmap images by
subdividing until each square has the same color value.  This and
related partitions have many applications in computational geometry and
geometric applications, including data clustering,
 shape representation , n-body simulation in
 astronomy  and  molecular
modeling , and  mesh generation .
     The
Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model  claims to be using
Voronoi diagrams as a basis for spatial subdivision, but appears to
actually be using quadtrees.

of the linear quadtree to astronomical databases , P. Barrett, NASA.
Encoding astronomical coordinates with quadtrees can provide significant
improvements in efficiency when accessing sources near a given direction
and can aid in the correlation of positions from different astronomical
catalogs.
