              Abstract   
Marginal MAP problems are known to be very difficult tasks for graphical models and are so far solved exactly by systematic search guided by a join-tree upper bound. In this paper, we develop new AND/OR branch and bound algorithms for marginal MAP that use heuristics extracted from weighted mini-buckets enhanced with message-passing updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting search algorithms against previous join-tree based approaches, which we also extend to accommodate high induced width models, through extensive empirical evaluations. Our results show not only orders-of-magnitude improvements over the state-of-the-art, but also the ability to solve problem instances well beyond the reach of previous approaches.
