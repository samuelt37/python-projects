Most of my research is in the design and analysis of algorithms,
but some of my papers are completely non-algorithmic,
instead consisting of theorems about graphs or combinatorial geometry.
Some other papers, while primarily about algorithms,
also contain non-algorithmic content of independent interest.

The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

Discusses the expected behavior of Delaunay triangulations for
points chosen uniformly at random (without edge effects).
The main result is that within a region containing  n  points,
the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,

(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a

    Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity . 
D. Eppstein. 
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.   J. Graph Th.  17: 409–416, 1993 .
 
It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
  
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
 formal
concept analysis . If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

    Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188. 
 
For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
" The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The
Computer J.  51: 292–302, 2008.

We consider several variations of the problem of
 coloring  the squares of a
 quadtree  so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
 regression depth  at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small

    Topological issues in hexahedral meshing . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at
 Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science , Stanford, 2001.
 
We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns

family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including " Algorithms for Media ", " Algorithms for Drawing Media ", " Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces ", and
" The Lattice Dimension of a Graph ".

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 384–389.  
We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

54 (4): 771–797, 2015 .  
We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L 1  plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.
  
    Densities of minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1009.5633 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  17(1), Paper R136, 2010 .
 
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
 c ( n  +  o ( n ); for instance, for
planar graphs,  c  = 3. We call  c  the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ω ω , and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.
  
    Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the

Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .

J. Reislhuber.  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 327–338 .  
A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.
  
    The graphs of planar soap bubbles . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1207.3761 .   Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36 .
 
We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.
  
   Small superpatterns for dominance drawing .  M. J. Bannister ,

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103  .
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.
