  5 May 2000: 
Shape Transformation Using Variational Implicit Functions  Sergey Kirshner , ICS, UC Irvine 

 The paper by Greg Turk and James F.O'Brien introduces a method of
creating a smooth interpolating function to build a morph between two 2D
or 3D shapes. 

 As a side note, this paper is a base for the project I am working on
with Prof. Renato Pajarola.  If time permits, I will describe the
direction of the project.
