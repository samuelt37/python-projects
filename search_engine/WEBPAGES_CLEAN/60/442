This paper deals with maintaining the topological order for a directed
 n -vertex acyclic graph as arcs are added to the graph as well as
detecting a cycle when one is created by adding a new arc.  There are
two algorithms described in the paper, the first dealing with  m 
arc additions in O( m  3/2 ) time.  This algorithm
improves the previous best bound by a logarithmic factor for sparse
networks and is within a constant factor among other algorithms
satisfying a natural locality property.  The second algorithm has an
upper bound of O( n  5/2 ) time and a lower bound of
Ω( n  2 2 √2 log  n  )
obtained by relating its performance to a generalization of
the  k -levels problem of combinatorial geometry.
