 AND/OR Search Spaces for Graphical Models 

 Rina Dechter and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper introduces an AND/OR search space perspective for graphical models that include
probabilistic networks (directed or undirected) and constraint networks. In contrast
to the traditional (OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree displays some of the
independencies present in the graphical model explicitly and may sometimes reduce the
search space exponentially. Indeed, most algorithmic advances in search-based constraint
processing and probabilistic inference can be viewed as searching an AND/OR search tree
or graph. Familiar parameters such as the depth of a spanning tree, treewidth and pathwidth
are shown to play a key role in characterizing the effect of AND/OR search graphs vs. the
traditional OR search graphs. We compare memory intensive AND/OR graph search with
inference methods, and place various existing algorithms within the AND/OR search space.
