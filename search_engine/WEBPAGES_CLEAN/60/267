        AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams for Constraint Optimization    
       Robert Mateescu, Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
				We propose a new top down search-based algorithm for compiling
				AND/ORMulti-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs), as representations of the
				optimal set of solutions for constraint optimization problems. The approach is
				based on AND/OR search spaces for graphical models, state-of-the-art AND/OR
				Branch-and-Bound search, and on decision diagrams reduction techniques. We
				extend earlier work on AOMDDs by considering general weighted graphs based
				on cost functions rather than constraints. An extensive experimental evaluation
				proves the efficiency of the weighted AOMDD data structure.
