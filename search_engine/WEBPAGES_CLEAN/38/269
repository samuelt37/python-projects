What is Courcelle's Theorem?
 
 
Michael Bannister
 
 
Courcelle's theorem is a powerful algorithmic meta-theorem, producing
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for recognizing graph families
definable in monadic second order logic. In this talk, I will cover
the background needed to understand and apply Courcelle's theorem,
including applications to typical hard graph properties, e.g., graph
coloring, hamiltonian cycle, and crossing minimization.
