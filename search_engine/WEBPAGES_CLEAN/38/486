&gt;David Durand and Fabio Vitali posted a thought-provoking draft of

Thanks!

&gt;I think the first bullet, "(Versioning) allows more efficient management of
&gt;large web sites," is a benefit that can be ascribed to facilities for the
&gt;management of configurations of versioned resources, rather than simply to
&gt;versioning individual resources.  Thus I see efficient management of large
&gt;web sites helped by CM capabilities working in tandem with versioning
&gt;capabilities, not simply by versioning capabilities alone.

To a great extent this is true. Should we be expanding this document to
cover CM, or just delete this point, for a future requirements document?
Doesn't even simple versioning help manage somewhat, if only by offering an
audit trail and improved accountability (depending on the kinds of server
logs and access control the server implements)? While I think that this is
part of the larger rationale, it could be postpond to the CM requirements,
if people agree.

&gt;The second bullet, "(Versioning) allows concurrent and controlled access to
&gt;resources by authors and editors" is at once too broad and too restrictive.
&gt;Too broad, because browsers already handle concurrent and controlled
&gt;access to resources: they serve the resource concurrently to everyone who
&gt;asks for it (excepting cases where the resource is password protected).
&gt;Too restrictive, because the potential roles of people employing versioning
&gt;capabilities is far greater than simply authors and editors.  Computer
&gt;programmers, reviewers, managers, students, etc. are all people whose roles
&gt;both fall, and don't fall under "authors and editors."
   What we meant are people who make changes and people who create
documents. Personally I don't have a problem using author to refer to
anyone who creates a web document, whether program, home page, term paper,
or novel. Shall we use the rather uglier terms "resource creators" and
"resource updaters" instead? Or should we add a definition of the terms
that stresses their wide-ranging applicability?

&gt;However, I think this bullet does get at the essence of one of the most
&gt;important capabilities versioning should provide: parallel development
&gt;support, the ability for two or more people to simultaneously edit a
&gt;resource.  The second issue alluded to in this bullet is access control, in
&gt;many versioning schemes a necessary support capability for parallel
&gt;development.

These are indeed the points we were shooting at.

&gt; Thus I think the "concurrent and controlled access" bullet
&gt;should be subdivided into two bullets:
&gt;
&gt;- Versioning provides parallel development support
&gt;- Versioning provides access control over resources

    I will make these changes without further discussion.

&gt;The bullet stating that versioning enhances annotation support due to the
&gt;preservation of the historical record merges several points which should be
&gt;separated:
&gt;- Versioning provides a consistent naming scheme for versions of a resource
The more I think about this one, the more it seems tautological (basically,
all it says is that keeping track of versions lets us keep track of
versions -- not too thrilling). I will delete this point and  rewrite your
two points:

&gt;This supports two major rationales for versioning:
&gt;- browse access to previous versions of a resource
&gt;- annotation support

We had quite some discussion of this. It's awkward because we wanted to
have the rationale provide axioms, that lead to functional requirements,
that will then constrain the architecture... So we thought that combining
them makes sense. In fact, annotation support is in a way too limiting,
since one of the virtues of versioning support is also the support of
version-aware links, and externally stored links, even in non-annotative
contexts.

   So we should change the two bullets to something like the following:
- we allow browsing through the past and alternative versions of a resource.
- we can support externally stored links, allowing annotations, and
more-flexible linking.
- we can support configuration control of consistent sets of linked resources,
