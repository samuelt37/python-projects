     Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Constraints in Temporal Reasoning

 Abstract  
This paper presents a general model for temporal reasoning that is capable of
handling both qualitative and quantitative information. This model allows the 
representation and processing of many types of constraints discussed in the literature
to date, including metric constraints (restricting the distance between time points)
and qualitative, disjunctive constraints (specifying the relative position of temporal
objects). Reasoning tasks in this unified framework are formulated as constraint 
satisfaction problems and are solved by traditional constraint satisfaction techniques, such
as backtracking and path consistency. New classes of tractable problems are characterized, 
involving qualitative networks augmented by quantitative domain constraints,
some of which can be solved in polynomial time using arc and path consistency.
