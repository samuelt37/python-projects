  Dynamic Architectures  
      Problem: How can we characterize systems that evolve during run-time?
 
     Approach: Use architectural modeling and analysis
 
     Complicating factors: Architectural reconfiguration may interact with on-going computations
 
     Claim: Need specifications that can expose the interactions between reconfiguration and other architectural properties
