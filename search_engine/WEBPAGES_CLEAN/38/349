  Principal: Organizations  
        Organizations are much like people
 

      Literally and legally, as �incorporation� suggests
         Scale has a quality all its own
 

      Easier to trust a group of people over time with internal checks and balances and standards
    Anytime trust has to be shared with a different principal
           Credentials bind people to devices
 

      It is more efficient to intermediate relationships
    Reflects the same transaction costs as optimal firm-size theory does in real world economics
