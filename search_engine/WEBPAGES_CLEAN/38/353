   Hardness of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph
drawings .  M. J. Bannister  and
D. Eppstein.  Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 367â€“378.
 
We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.
See the journal
version, " Inapproximability of
orthogonal compaction ",
for some improvements and corrections.
