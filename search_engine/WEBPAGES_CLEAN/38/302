virtual bool SetEnd(OEAtomBase *end)
    
Define the ``end'' (or ``destination'') atom of a bond.  Normally, the end
atom of a bond is defined when the bond is created with
 OEMolBase::NewBond .  However, it is occasionally useful to defer
this decision, by passing the NULL pointer,  (OEAtomBase*)0 , as the
end atom to  OEMolBase::NewBond .  The end atom should then later be
specified by calling this method,  OEBondBase::SetEnd , to resolve
the end atom before the molecule is used.  Note that it is not possible to
set/change the end atom of a bond, once it has been defined.  To
achieve the same behavior call the  OEMolBase::DeleteBond  method,
followed by  OEMolBase::NewBond , to first destroy the original and
replace it with a new bond.
