8.9.4 OEOFlavor::MDL 
 
This namespace controls the processing performed when writing
 OEFormat::MDL  format files using the  OEWriteMDLFile 
function.

 
The  OEOFlavor::MDL::PMask  set of bits controls the processing
of the MDL stereo parity bit field of each atom.  The default
behaviour, with just the  OEOFlavor::MDL::MDLParity  flag set,
is to call the function  OEMDLPerceiveParity  if the function
 OEMDLHasParity  returns false.  This determines the
parity bit from OEChem's perceived stereochemistry if the MDL parity
bits haven't already been set.  Alternatively, the
 OEOFlavor::MDL::NoParity  flag, instructs the high level writer
to clear the MDL stereo parity field of every atom to zero.  Finally,
 OEOFlavor::MDL::CurrentParity  (or neither  MDLParity  nor
 NoParity ) instructs the high-level writer to leave the MDL
parity bits alone.
