       Course Overview 
        
           The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic principles of Artificial Intelligence. 
           Topics covered Include: Heuristic search, Adversarial search, Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Knowledge representation, Reasoning and Planning.
           We will cover much of the content of chapters 1-14 in the course book.

        
         
       Assignments: 
        
           There will be weekly homework-assignments, a project, and a final.

        
         
       Course-Grade: 
        
           Homeworks will account for 20% of the grade, project 30% of the grade, final 50% of the grade.

        
         

       Project 
        
           You will be required to do a project. This includes submitting a written report at the end of the quarter :

              Due to the large number of students enrolled, each project will be a team project (2-3 stundents per team). 
             Projects can be of the following types 
              Article-centered project.
            
              
            
            A project can be centered on 1-2 primary articles selected from a recent AI conference(IJCAI, AAAI, UAI, CP, SoCS, etc.)/journal(e.g. AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, etc.).

         The idea is that the paper will open a window to a subject that the students read and explore.
         You may need to read earlier papers for background and information (that appear in the citations of the primary papers).
         Students may investigate the validity of paper by running code developed on some benchmarks whenever relevant.



         The team will
          write a project report to be handed in at the end of the course.
         The project report should include a description and evaluation of the paper and any creative independent work carried out by the team.
                   Programming project.

                 

                       A project can consist of picking a particular problem class and task (e.g. solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems),
                       and writing a computer program to solve problem instances of this class. There are repositories of benchmarks that
                       students can get problem instances, for example

                        UCI repository  
                           Cost Function Optimization problems  
                          Your own project idea, on the topic of AI (e.g., implementing an algorithm and applying to some domain).
             Students need to obtain approval before proceeding.   Each team needs to submit a written report (one report per team) at the end of the course (exact date TDB). 
             Teams should be formed and project proposals finalized/approved by early Nov at the latest.
