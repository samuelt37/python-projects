  computing technology changed some aspect of your work or play (e.g. calendar
  programs, party planner on Yahoo, palmtops and handhelds, laptops, GPS,
  email, and cell phones). Be prepared to tell a positive (beneficial) aspect
  of your story as well as a negative (detrimental) aspect; either for yourself
  or as you imagine for others. 
       
    Deadline for next
  batch of writeups!  The current topic will finish on 11/14; we return to
  the rule that narratives and short summaries are due 1 week thereafter. So,
