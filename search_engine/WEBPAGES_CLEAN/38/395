 Faculty profile 

 
 

  Anton  Burtsev</strong>  Assistant Adjunct Professor</strong>  DEGREE: PhD 2013, University of Utah  RESEARCH AREAS:  Operating Systems  RESEARCH INTERESTS:  I am interested in designing and building new operating systems.  At the
moment my research work is concentrated around three main themes: (1)
new operating systems: novel abstractions for structuring operating
systems, microkernels, virtualization, decomposed and library kernels,
application of safe languages to operating systems, security and formal
verification of operating systems; (2) security and access control:
object capability access control, practical least authority for
virtualized environments and commodity operating systems, access control
in datacenter, enterprise, and cloud networks; (3) operating system
support for datacenter environments: operating systems for the whole
datacenter, low-latency system stacks for fast networking and storage
interfaces, novel virtualization solutions, fast inter-process
communication, efficient support of non-uniform memory machines and
emerging high-density non-volatile memory servers.  CONTACT INFORMATION:
