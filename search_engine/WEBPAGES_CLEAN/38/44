 Abstract   
   
This paper provides an overview of Project RESCUE, which aims to enhance the 
mitigation capabilities of first responders in the event of a crisis by 
dramatically transforming their ability to collect, store, analyze, interpret, 
share and disseminate data. The multidisciplinary research agenda incorporates a 
variety of information technologies: networks; distributed systems; databases; 
image and video processing; and machine learning, together with subjective 
information obtained through social science. While the IT challenges focus on 
systems and algorithms to get the right information to the right person at the 
right time, social science provides the right context. Besides providing an 
overview of the nature of RESCUE research activities the paper highlights 
challenges of particular interest to the Internet imaging community.
