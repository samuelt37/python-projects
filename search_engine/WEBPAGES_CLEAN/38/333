void OEWritePDBFile(oemolostream &amp;ofs, OEMolBase &amp;mol,
                    unsigned int flavor = OEPDBOFlag::DEFAULT)
    
Write the molecule as a Brookhaven PDB format file to the output stream
ofs.  A number of different PDB format variants are supported by use of
the bits in the ``flavor'' parameter.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::BONDS  flag is used to control whether the OEChem
PDB file writer includes CONECT records to describe the connectivity of
the molecule.  If this flag is given without  OEPDBOFlag::ORDERS 
all bonds are written as ``single'' bonds.   OEPDBOFlag::BONDS  is
off by default.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::ORDERS  flag is used to control whether the PDB file
writer should use repeated CONECT records to represent multiple bond
orders ( i.e.  double and triple bonds).  If this flag is given without
 OEPDBOFlag::BONDS  only double and triple bonds are written to the
file.   OEPDBOFlag::ORDERS  is off by default.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::BOTH  flag is used to control whether CONECT records
are written bi-directionally.  Conventionally, PDB files list connect records
both from source atom to destination atom, and again from destination to
source.  This duplication doubles the number/size of CONECT records with
redundant information, as most readers (if they honor CONECT records at
all) can work with uni-directional CONECT records.  By default, OEChem's
PDB writer only output uni-directional CONECT records where the source
atom's serial number is always less than the destination atom's.  The
 OEPDBOFlag::BOTH  can be used to request full bi-directional PDB files.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::CHARGE  flag can be used to instruct the OEChem PDB
file writer to take the value for the PDB file's B-factor field from the
atom's partial charge property.  A number of applications, including
Delphi, (ab)use the PDB file format specification to store atomic
partial charges in the b-factor field rather instead of crystallographically
determined anisotropic temperature factors.   OEPDBOFlag::CHARGE  is
off by default.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::RADIUS  flag can be used to instruct the OEChem PDB
file writer to take the value for the PDB file's occupancy field from the
atom's radius property.  A number of applications, including Delphi,
(ab)use the PDB file format specification to store radii in the occupancy
field rather instead of crystallographically determined anisotropic
occupancies.   OEPDBOFlag::RADIUS  is off by default.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::DELPHI  flag is just the combination of the
 OEPDBOFlag::CHARGE  and  OEPDBOFlag::RADIUS  flags.

  
The  OEPDBOFlag::TER  flag can be used to instruct the OEChem PDB file
writer to terminate each connection table with a TER record rather than
an END record.  Some dubious molecular graphics software, such as Grasp,
requires that multiple compounds be separated by the chain/fragment
separator TER, rather than the molecule separator END.
 OEPDBOFlag::TER  is off by default.
