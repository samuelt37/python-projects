   Data Set Information:  
 Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:  CAR                      car acceptability . PRICE                  overall price . . buying               buying price . . maint                price of the maintenance . TECH                   technical characteristics . . COMFORT              comfort . . . doors              number of doors . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot . . safety               estimated safety of the car  Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see  [Web Link] ).  The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.  Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.  

   Attribute Information:
