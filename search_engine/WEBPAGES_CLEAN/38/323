 ICS Tech. Report Availability<body> A Note on Technical Report Availability 

Some of my papers have been published as ICS departmental
technical reports.  Unfortunately, the ICS department technical report
web server is never up.  If the report you want is not already available
from  my publications page ,
 send me
an email  with the title and I'll try to dig up a copy for you.
