void OEDetermineConnectivity(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
Perceive the covalent bonds of a molecule from 3D coordinates.  This
routine creates a bond between any pair of atoms that are closer than
the sum of their covalent radii plus a slop factor of 0.45 Angstroms.
The covalent radii of each atom are as defined by the Cambridge
Crystallographic Database, and are those returned by the OEChem
function OEGetCovalentRadius.  Bonds are not created by atoms
separated by less than 0.4A.  All bonds are created with bond order 1.
The OEChem function OEPerceiveBondOrders may be used to assign bond
orders from the 3D geometry and connectivity.
