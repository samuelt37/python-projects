Speeds up 3-coloring by solving a harder problem:
constraint satisfaction in which each variable can take on
one of three values and each constraint forbids a pair of
variable assignments.  The detailed solution involves
several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,
3-edge-coloring, and 3-SAT.  The 3-SAT algorithm is fixed-parameter tractible in that it is polynomial time when the number of 3-variable clauses is O(log n).
Merged into
 3-coloring in time O(1.3289^n) 
for the journal version.

    Algorithms for coloring quadtrees .  M. Bern ,

We consider several variations of the problem of
 coloring  the squares of a
 quadtree  so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

    Small maximal independent sets and faster exact graph coloring .

We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

    Choosing colors for geometric graphs via color space embeddings.   M. Dillencourt ,

14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 294–305 .
 
We show how to choose colors for the vertices of a graph drawing in such
a way that all colors are easily distinguishable, but such that adjacent
vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

    Minimum forcing sets for Miura folding patterns .  B. Ballinger ,

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.
