The OpenEye libraries provide convenient mechanisms for handling molecular
input and output using the oemolstream classes (see the Chapter on
 Reading and Writing Molecules ). However, not all file formats have
been implemented for OEChem and not all data is molecular. For these reasons,
OpenEye provides an extensive set of  oestream  classes, found in the
 OEPlatform  library, to handle input and output. These  oestreams 
were designed with the C++ standard  iostream  classes in mind and
therefore their use should be familiar to programmers who have used the
standard  iostream  classes.
