    For an important class of safety- and mission-critical software systems, such as air
    traffic control, telephone switching, and high availability public information
    systems, shutting down and restarting the system for upgrades incurs unacceptable delays,
    increased cost, and risk. Support for runtime modification is a key aspect of these
    systems.  Dynamic software architectures  represent one encouraging approach
    to mitigating these difficulties.
   

   
    These pages attempt to organize and coalesce the on-going work in the field of
    dynamic software architectures. Additions, errors, comments, etc. should be directed to

    This page hasn't been updated in since 2000 and a lot has happened since.
