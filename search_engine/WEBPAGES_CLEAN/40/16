       We are using one textbook: </strong> Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet ,   James Kurose &amp; Keith Ross, Addison-Wesley, 6th Edition. 
        You can purchase either a paper copy or an electronic copy.</strong> 
       Paper copy: Purchase at the UCI bookstore or at any other bookstore. The retail price is $155, but you can find it for considerably less. I will be assigning problems out of the book. If you buy something older than the 6th edition, you are responsible for figuring out which problems to do, since older editions may have different problems. 
       Electronic copy: Go to the  CourseSmart webpage for the book . The price is $52-$89, depending on duration. This will allow you to read the book while online. If you want to read it offline, or if find online access too slow, then download a  CourseSmart app  that supports offline access. I recommend that you also consider printing  the pages with assigned problems.
