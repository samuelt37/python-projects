 These are the five big feature areas you�ll find in today�s word processors when it comes to collaboration. The first four are in Word 6.0 and 7.0, and the last is in Lotus Word Pro 96. For each, I�ll discuss the user problem, how the feature solves the problem, and some considerations for the Web. These considerations are not in any sense exhaustive, they�re just a starting point.
