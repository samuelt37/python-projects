 Computer Science 163/265, Spring 2015: 
Graph Algorithms 

  General Course Information 

 The course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, 2:00 - 2:50
in  Steinhaus
134 .  Prof. Eppstein's office hours are Tuesdays 1:30 - 3:00 (or by
appointment) in Bren 4082.  The
T.A. is  Jenny Lam ; her
office hours are Mon 9:00 - 10:30 in Bren 4032, Wed 10:30-12:00 in Bren
4013, and Fri 10:30-12 in Bren 3013. We also have Shu "Aimery" Kong as a
reader. 

 Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final exam. Group work on homeworks is permitted;
each student should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. The
undergraduate (163) and graduate (265) courses will share lectures, and
some homework problems; however, the graduate course will have
additional homework problems and different exams. Homeworks will be due
electronically in PDF format via the eee web site. 

 The text we will be using is   Graph
Algorithms  , a collection of readings compiled from
Wikipedia. Homework solutions will be
posted  here .

  The final grade will be formed by combining the numerical scores from
the homeworks (20%), midterm (35%), and final (45%).
