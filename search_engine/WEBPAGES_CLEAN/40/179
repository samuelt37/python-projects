              Abstract   

 Bucket elimination is an algorithmic framework that generalizes dynamic programming
to accommodate many problem-solving and reasoning tasks. In particular, it can be used for any
combinatorial optimization task such as finding most probable configurations in a Bayesian network.
In this paper we present a new algorithm elim-m-opt, extending bucket elimination for the task of
finding m best solutions for an optimization task for any value of m. We formulate our algorithm using
general notion of combination and marginalization operators and show that our approach is sound. We
provide complexity analysis and compare it with related work. Potential extension to the mini-bucket
framework and its impact on heuristic-search for m-best are discussed.
