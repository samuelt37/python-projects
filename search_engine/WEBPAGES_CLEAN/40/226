              Use the input fields to filter the information
                    down to what's relevant to you.  In particular...
                  Fill in the "User / Student IDs" box with a list
                    of all the student ID numbers you want to check for
                    (one number per line).
                    You can copy-and-paste a column right out of Excel
                    to easily do this.
                  Fill in the "Record Start" date with the earliest
                    records you want to look for
                    (e.g., beginning of the quarter "27-Sep-2007").
                  Click on Submit Query to extract out a report on
                    how many problems students have completed.
                    This is further broken down into problems
                    completed per chapter as well as which non-random
                    (assigned) problems each student completed.
                     
                    If you scroll to the very bottom of the page,
                    the same data is available in tab-delimited format
                    in a big textbox.  This is suitable to do a complete
                    copy-and-paste into Excel for further analysis
                    in a PivotTable.
