What of the input can we explore besides n?

In "Interploation search for non-independent data"
by Demaine, Jones and Patrascu [SODA 2004, pp.522-523],
the complexity of a simple searching algorithm
is analyzed not by the input size  n 
but by a gap ratio Delta =
(max distance of two adjacent values)/(min distance of
two adjacent values).  Previous work on interpolation search
always assumed some distribution on the input data
and (still) used the input size  n  for complexity analysis.
  
Time allowing, there will be a discussion of
"A note on the nearest neighbor in growth-restricted metrics"
by Hildrum, Kubiatowicz, and Rao [SODA 2004, pp.553-554].
In this paper, although the complexity is represented by the
input size  n , it is based on a constraint of the input.
