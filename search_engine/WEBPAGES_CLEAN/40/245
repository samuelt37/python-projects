On the Complexity of Delaunay Triangulations on Manifolds
 

 Nina Amenta (UC Davis) 

 
 Abstract: 
  
Even more than most spatial data structures,
the Delaunay triangulation suffers from the "curse of dimensionality".
A classic theorem of McMullen says that the worst-case complexity
of the Delaunay triangulation of a set of  n  points in dimension
 d  is θ( n  ⌈ d /2⌉ ).
The point sets constructed to realize this exponential bound are
distributed on one-dimensional curves.
What about distributions of points on manifolds of dimension
1 &lt;  p  ≤  d ? 
  
We consider sets of points distributed nearly uniformly on a polyhedral
surfaces of dimension  p ,
and find that their Delaunay triangulations
have complexity O( n  ( d-k +1)/ p  ),
with  k  being the ceiling of ( d +1)/( p +1),
and we show that this bound is tight.
