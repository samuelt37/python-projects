 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Instrumented Connectors  Intent       Shared Library (DLL) mediator?   Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Instrumented connectors have the following benefits:       They are fine grained. The callee and function name            are dissernable and may be used to provide            alternative behavior.       Instrumented connectors have the following limitations:       They are platform dependent.          Composability is difficult.        Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses        Bob    Balzer  at the ISI has built an interactive, graphical    architecture editor by creating instrumented connectors for    Microsoft's PowerPoint. They have also created a virtual,    encrypted file system browsable by Netscape's Navigator using    instrumented connectors.   Related Mechanisms       The instrumented connector is a particular type of  communication    intermediation .      Backto the Adaptation home page   .
