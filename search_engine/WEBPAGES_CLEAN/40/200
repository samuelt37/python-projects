  Informatics 143 � Exploring
Many Eyes    

     

 This assignment is due on Tuesday, May 12 (before the start
of class at 3:30 as usual). 

     

 The first step is to create an account on Many Eyes. 

     

  Go to  http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home  
  Create
     an account. 
      

 The second step is to find a data set, edit it / clean it up,
upload it, and visualize it. 

     

  To
     find a dataset, go to the Census Bureau�s Statistical Abstract web page,
     at  http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/  
  Find
     an Excel file that interests you, and download it. 
  Add a
     new sheet to the downloaded Excel file for your edited / cleaned up data,
     and copy the main data onto that sheet. 
  Edit
     the copy on the new sheet, so that extraneous rows are gone and all column
     headings are meaningful. 
  Upload
     your data into Many Eyes, and give it meaningful  meta 
     data. 
  Explore
     several visualizations of your data. 
  Select
     a visualization that is particularly meaningful and interesting, and
     another that may look good but doesn�t convey any interesting
     relationships in the data. �  Publish
     each of those, with helpful names. 
      

 The third step is to upload a short report to
Checkmate. �  The report can be in Word (not
. docx ), text, or PDF format. �  Briefly describe the data and how you manipulated
the data. �  Did you remove columns or
rows? �  Give the Many Eyes names of your
two visualizations, and explain in short paragraphs why the good one is good
and the bad one is bad.
