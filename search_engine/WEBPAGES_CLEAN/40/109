Software architectures shift the focus of developers from lines-of-code 
to coarser-grained architectural elements and their interconnection structure. 
This talk will provide an introduction to software architecture: its 
elements and concepts, architecture description languages, styles, and 
domain-specific software architectures. A guiding perspective for the 
presentation will be supporting evolution of software products over an 
extended period of time.

  

 Biography:</strong>
Richard N. Taylor received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from 
the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1980. He is a Professor with the 
Department of Information and Computer Science, University of California 
at Irvine, where he has been since 1982. He is a principal investigator 
on one of DARPA's evolutionary design of complex systems (EDCS) projects. 
His research interests are centered on software architectures, user 
interface software, workflow and process technologies, and hypermedia.

  

Professor Taylor is the Director of the Irvine Research Unit in Software 
(IRUS). He was a 1985 recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator Award, 
National Chairman for ACM's Special Interest Group on Software Engineering, 
SIGSOFT (1989 - 1993), Program Co-Chair of the 1997 International Conference 
on Software Engineering (ICSE 97), and is an ACM Fellow.

  

  Bringing Software Architecture into the Software Development Process </strong>

Over the last few years there has been increasing recognition that software 
architecture is an important and distinct characteristic of software that 
merits its own specialized modeling languages and development tools. 
Researchers in software architecture have defined a number of highly 
expressive formal languages that can support powerful analyses of 
architectural models. However, there has been little effort to date on 
integrating these languages and tools with the software development 
processes used by mainstream practitioners. In this talk I will first 
discuss the proper role of architecture within the broader context of the 
software development lifecycle, and then I will describe recent work on 
integrating architectural description languages (ADLs) with the Unified 
Modeling Language (UML). UML is gaining wide acceptance in industry because 
of its rich support for object-oriented analysis and design processes, but 
it lacks support for architectural modeling and analysis. The work I will 
describe involves extending UML to support architectural modeling with C2 
and Wright, two of the most widely-studied architecture description 
languages. The extensions are defined in a way that allows them to be used 
in conjunction with existing UML tools.

  

 Biography:</strong>
 David S. Rosenblum is an Associate Professor in the Department 
of Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. 
His research interests are centered on the design and validation of 
distributed component-based software. He received a PhD in 1988 from 
Stanford University, and from 1988 to 1996 he was a Research Member of 
the Technical Staff at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He is 
the author of numerous technical papers on a variety of topics in software 
engineering. He is a member of the ACM and a senior member of the IEEE.
