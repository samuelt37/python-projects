Schramm's mathematical picture gallery  primarily concentrating in
square tilings and circle packings, many forming fractal patterns.
 
    Self-affine tiles .
Marina Khibnik computes the convex hulls and boundary dimensions of
fractal tiles such as the twin dragon and fractal red cross.
 
    Snowflake
reptile  hexagonal substitution tiling (sometimes known as the Gosper
Island) rediscovered by NASA
and conjectured to perform visual processing in the human brain.
