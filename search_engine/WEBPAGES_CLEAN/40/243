33.2 Objects and Free-Functions 
 

 
OEChem is an object-oriented library.  However, we have taken a design
philosophy that molecule objects are primarily data containers with data access
member functions.  Most powerful data analysis and manipulation routines in
OEChem are implemented as free functions rather than member functions.  This
decision is based on the realization that the abstraction of a molecule
can be neither stable nor consistent.  To one programmer, a molecule should
describe and perceive the space group of organometallic complexes, while to
another a molecule should describe the residues and secondary structure of
a macromolecule.  Both of these perspectives are reasonable and should be
supported.  Further, a nearly infinite additional list of molecule designs
can be imagined and should be supported.  In order to do this, the OEChem
molecule must be extensible, light-weights, and easily re-implemented.
Thus, can make major changes to the OEChem
molecules, without needed to re-implement more than a handful of functions.
Conversely, we can add an entire new area of chemistry to the OEChem
repertoire through free-functions  without needing to implement the
function in multiple molecules.
We
have used namespaces extensively to keep the free-functions from cluttering the global
namespace.
