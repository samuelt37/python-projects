 Implications: Circuit Blocks<body>

  Implications: Circuit Blocks  
      Frequent use of signal repeaters in block-level designs
 
  longest interconnect=2000 mu for 0.3 mu process 
       A storage element no longer (always) defines a clock boundary
 
  storage delay (=1.5x switching delay)
  multiple storage elements in a single clock
  multiple state transitions in a clock period
  storage-controlled routing
       Circuit block designs that work independently of data latencies
 
  asynchronous blocks
       Heterogenous clocking interfaces
 
  pausible clocking [Yun, ICCD96]
  mixed synchronous, asynchronous circuit blocks.
