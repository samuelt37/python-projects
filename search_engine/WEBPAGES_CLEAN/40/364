   Data Set Information:  
 This database is a standardized version of the original audiology database (see audiology.* in this directory).  The non-standard set of attributes have been converted to a standard set of attributes according to the rules that follow.  * Each property that appears anywhere in the original .data or .test file has been represented as a separate attribute in this file.  * A property such as age_gt_60 is represented as a boolean attribute with values f and t.  * In most cases, a property of the form x(y) is represented as a discrete attribute x() whose possible values are the various y's; air() is an example.  There are two exceptions: ** when only one value of y appears anywhere, e.g. static(normal). In this case, x_y appears as a boolean attribute. ** when one case can have two or more values of x, e.g. history(..). All possible values of history are treated as separate boolean attributes.  * Since boolean attributes only appear as positive conditions, each boolean attribute is assumed to be false unless noted as true.  The value of multi-value discrete attributes taken as unknown ("?") unless a value is specified.  * The original case identifications, p1 to p200 in the .data file and t1 to t26 in the .test file, have been added as a unique identifier attribute.   [Note: in the original .data file, p165 has a repeated specification of o_ar_c(normal); p166 has repeated specification of speech(normal) and conflicting values air(moderate) and air(mild).  No other problems with the original data were noted.]
