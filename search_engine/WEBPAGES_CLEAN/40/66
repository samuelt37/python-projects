         University Of California-Irvine’s Hyperloop Prototype Ready For January Weekend Competition
</strong>
           By Amanda Foster</strong>
                    
The University of California-Irvine engineering team, or the "HyperXite" team, is ready to take their prototype to the 1.25 km track on Sunday, as reported by the Orange County Business Journal. During the weekend competition, the pods will be evaluated for stability, speed, braking and smoothness. And the UCI team is ready for it.

  
With a team of 50 students from the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Sciences, they are going to present a light weight, carbon fiber-made pod that can levitate and carry passengers at high speeds safely.
