  EDUCATION     Ph.D. Information and Computer Science, University of California,
Irvine, expected June, 2000.

  M.S. Information and Computer Science, University of California,
Irvine, Dec. 1994.

  B.S. Electrical Engineering,  Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute , May 1989.

    WORK EXPERIENCE     
 Chair,  
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) 
Working Group,  Internet Engineering Task
Force , March 1997-present. 

Founded and led this working group to enable Web-based remote
collaborative authoring and versioning tools to be broadly
interoperable. Assembled a broad coalition of participants from
industry and academia, including Microsoft, Netscape, IBM, Novell,
Xerox, Rational, Merant, and OTI. Developed the WebDAV Distributed
Authoring Protocol, extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) to support remote collaborative authoring, now supported by
such industry-leading applications and servers as Office 2000,
Internet Explorer 5, Apache, Internet Information Services 5, Exchange
2000, DAV4J (IBM Alphaworks), and many others. Instrumental in the
formation of the follow-on  DASL 
(DAV Searching and Locating) and
 Delta-V  (versioning and configuration management) working groups
within the IETF.    Research Assistant, University of California, Irvine, 1993-present. 
Performed research for DARPA research projects in the areas of remote
collaborative authoring, open hypertext, hypertext
versioning, software architecture, and software
environments. Participated on several DARPA grant-writing teams.

   Teaching Assistant, University of California, Irvine, 1992-1993. 
Assisted in the teaching of the undergraduate level Software Engineering
course, and the Software Engineering Project course. Consistently
earned excellent student reviews.

   Engineer,  Raytheon  Equipment
Division, 1989-1992.  Wrote firmware in C and Ada for the German
Civilian Air Traffic Control (ATC) System (DERD), and for a prototype
Microwave Airplane Landing System (MLS). Adapted air traffic control
software to create a marketing demonstration of a vessel traffic
control system. Developed prototype touch panel displays for use
with the DERD system. Project highlights include:

   Wrote firmware using the Spark safety-critical subset of Ada
for an R3000 to monitor the control electronics of a MLS in real-time.
Wrote a C program to test a Phase Shifter Controller board. Debugged
system hardware to the component level while performing integration.

  Wrote a multi-screen textual user interface for a real-time
multiprocessor (four 68020 single board computers connected via
a VME bus) simulator of nine radars, six direction finders, and
a flight plan information system for the DERD ATC system.
