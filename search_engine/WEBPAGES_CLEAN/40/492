  October 9, 1998:  Geometric Thickness of Complete
Graphs   Michael Dillencourt , ICS, UC Irvine 

 We define the  geometric thickness     of a
graph to be the smallest number of layers such that we can draw the
graph in the plane with straight-line edges and assign each edge to
a layer so that no two edges on the same layer
cross.    The geometric thickness lies between two
previously studied quantities, the (graph-theoretical) thickness
and the book thickness.    We investigate the
geometric thickness of the family of complete graphs,
K  n  .    We show that the geometric
thickness of K  n   lies between
ceil( (n/5.646) + 0.342 ) and
ceil( n/4 ), and we give exact values of the geometric
thickness of K  n   for  n  &lt; 12 and  
n  in {15,16}. 

 This is joint work with  David Eppstein 
and  Daniel Hirschberg .
