The software community has long been awaiting the public release of the
draft of the updated Capability Maturity Model for
Software. In the first public presentation after the model's release,
members of the CMMI project will talk about the details of the
new model (termed the CMMI-SW/SE) and appraisal methods, and changes
from version 1.1.
Information on how to obtain the new model and appraisal documentation
will be provided.

  
The CMMI project is a collaborative effort sponsored by the Office of
the Secretary of Defense/Acquisition and Technology
(OSD/A&amp;T), with participation by government, industry, and the Software
Engineering Institute (SEI). The project's objective
is to develop a capability maturity model integrated product suite that
provides industry and government with a set of integrated
products to support process and product improvement. The project's
outputs include integrated model(s), assessment method(s),
and training materials.
