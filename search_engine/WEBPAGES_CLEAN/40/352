 Hyperweb Server Info Tab in the Hyperweb Manager<body>

  Home  

 Hyperweb Server Info Tab 

 This tab displays information about the website's Hyperweb Server. In
particular, it indicates if the Hyperweb server is currently active. If
so, this tab will display the name of the Hyperweb Server's host along
with the number of its communications port. Otherwise it will indicate
that the Hyperweb Server is currently inactive. 

   

 Operations 

 Two operations are available on this tab depending on the state of
the connection with the Hyperweb Server. If the Hyperweb Server is
connected, the  Unmanage Webs  command will disconnect it.
Otherwise the  Manage Webs  command will activate it. These
commands are available via the button at the bottom of the tab. It
toggles between the two operations such that both commands are available
from the same button. 

 Using the Unmanage Webs button 

 The  Unmanage Webs  operation deactivates the connected Hyperweb
Server.  It is only available when the Hyperweb Server is connected to
the Hyperweb Manager. 

 Example: Click the  Unmanage Webs  button to deactivate the
Hyperweb Server. 

   

 The tab responds by listing the Hyperweb Server as inactive. 

   

  Note:  All Chimera Servers connected to the Hyperweb Server
will be disconnected by the Unmanage command. 

 Using the Manage Webs button 

 The  Manage Webs  operation activates a new Hyperweb Server.  It
is only available when there is no active Hyperweb Server. 

 To activate a Hyperweb Server, click the  Manage Webs 
button. 

 Please be patient after clicking the  Manage Webs  button. 
Depending on your system, it may take a minute or longer to spawn a new
Hyperweb Server.
