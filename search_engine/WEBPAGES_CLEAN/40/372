 Equity &amp; Diversity 

 
 

  The UC Irvine campus is committed to supporting gender equity and diversity. There has never been a more important time to consider diversity in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. The field of computer science is changing rapidly, and an academic body with a diverse background can contribute unique ideas and perspectives to the creative development and study of new technologies for a global world. One of the ways we can achieve a more inclusive climate is to educate ourselves on the importance of diversity in our field.
