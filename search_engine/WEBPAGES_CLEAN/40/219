  CGAL::Euclidean_ring_tag  
 

  Definition 
 

The class   Euclidean_ring_tag   is used as a tag in some algorithms. It
indicates that a number type is to be considered as a model for
 EuclideanRingNumberType . Only operations defined for
 EuclideanRingNumberType  are used. For example, no divisions are
computed, even if the number type as such supports divisions.
