Buckyballs (n√©e Truncated Icosahedra)
 
The truncated icosahedron is, of course, one of the standard
Archimedean  polyhedra .
However, it and related shapes were popularized first by Buckminster
Fuller's geodesic domes, by its use in the design of soccer balls, and
then more recently by the discovery of
Carbon molecules in this shape.  The molecules were named
Buckminsterfullerene, or buckyballs
for short, and since then the name has attached itself to the geometric
shape as well.

This looks to me like a raytrace rather than a real model.
