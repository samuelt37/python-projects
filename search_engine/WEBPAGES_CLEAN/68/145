     16  Data Sets  
			   Table View    List View   
		       1.   Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer  : The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes.  2.   Character Trajectories  : Multiple, labelled samples of pen tip trajectories recorded whilst writing individual characters. All samples are from the same writer, for the purposes of primitive extraction. Only characters with a single pen-down segment were considered.  3.   Daily and Sports Activities  : The dataset comprises motion sensor data of 19 daily and sports activities each performed by 8 subjects in their own style for 5 minutes. Five Xsens MTx units are used on the torso, arms, and legs.
  4.   Dow Jones Index  : This dataset contains weekly data for the Dow Jones Industrial Index.  It has been used in computational investing research.  5.   Educational Process Mining (EPM): A Learning Analytics Data Set  : Educational Process Mining data set is built from the recordings of 115 subjects' activities through a logging application while learning with an educational simulator.  6.   ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014  : This data set contains electricity consumption of 370 points/clients.
  7.   Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations  : This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 different gases at various concentration levels.  8.   Gesture Phase Segmentation  : The dataset is composed by features extracted from 7 videos with people gesticulating, aiming at studying Gesture Phase Segmentation. It contains 50 attributes divided into two files for each video.  9.   Heterogeneity Activity Recognition  : The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) dataset from Smartphones and Smartwatches is a dataset devised to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms (classification, automatic data segmentation, sensor fusion, feature extraction, etc.) in real-world contexts; specifically, the dataset is gathered with a variety of different device models and use-scenarios, in order to reflect sensing heterogeneities to be expected in real deployments.  10.   Individual household electric power consumption  : Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.  11.   Online Retail  : This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.  12.   Open University Learning Analytics dataset  : Open University Learning Analytics Dataset contains data about courses, students and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment for seven selected courses and more than 30000 students.  13.   Synthetic Control Chart Time Series  : This data consists of synthetically generated control charts.  14.   Taxi Service Trajectory - Prediction Challenge, ECML PKDD 2015  : An accurate dataset describing trajectories performed by all the 442 taxis running in the city of Porto, in Portugal.
  15.   UJIIndoorLoc-Mag  : The UJIIndoorLoc-Mag is an indoor localization database to test Indoor Positioning System that rely on Earth's magnetic field variations.  16.   User Identification From Walking Activity  : The dataset collects data from an Android smartphone positioned in the chest pocket from 22 participants walking in the wild over a predefined path.
