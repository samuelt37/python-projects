 Cutset Sampling for Bayesian Networks 

 Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a new sampling methodology for Bayesian networks that samples
only a subset of variables and applies exact inference to the rest. Cutset sampling is a
network structure-exploiting application of the Rao-Blackwellisation principle to sampling
in Bayesian networks. It improves convergence by exploiting memory-based inference al-
gorithms. It can also be viewed as an anytime approximation of exact cutset-conditioning
algorithm (Pearl, 1988). Cutset sampling can be implemented efficiently when the sampled
variables constitute a loop-cutset of the Bayesian network and, more generally, when the
induced width of the networkï¿½s graph conditioned on the observed sampled variables is
bounded by a constant w. We demonstrate empirically the benefit of this scheme on a
range of benchmarks.
