The world of meta data and repositories which used to be the primary
 domain of data administration and development tool environments is now
 being reshaped and in fact occupies a key role in  distributed
 development and run time environments.  This session discusses the
 need for active meta data management and a distributed repository
 architecture that spans DCOM/CORBA to address the needs of enterprise
 wide meta data management.  Meta objects and meta models (OMG UML and
 MOF) are at the core of new standards being adopted by OMG.  Industry
 product development efforts at IBM, Unisys and Microsoft are finally
 coming to fruition and being deployed by customers.  This session will
 cover:
 
  

   Repository concepts and need for dynamic and extensible meta data
 management
  Evolution of repository architectures from monolithic to extensible
 distributed object repositories
  An architecture for a CORBA/DCOM based repository for the
 enterprise
  OMG efforts in repositories, components  and information models
 (UML, MOF, BOF, CORBA Component Model...) 
  Representative object repository products (IBM, Microsoft,
 Unisys...)
  Examples of object repository use in development tools integration,
 data warehousing and business objects
   

Tune in for the latest scoop from recent OMG meetings on the status of
 these evolving standards and industry products.

  

 Biography:</strong>   

Sridhar Iyengar, a Unisys Fellow leads the 
technology strategy for object technology products in Unisys.  Sridhar's 
current focus includes the integration of object frameworks, components, 
database, repository, internet and distributed object technology products for 
Unisys.  He is the chief architect of  Unisys Universal Repository (UREP)  
an extensible distributed object repository.  Sridhar represents Unisys at 
the OMG where he co-chairs the Object Analysis &amp; Design Task Force (OA&amp;DTF) 
which standardized the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Meta Object 
Facility(MOF) standards. He has a masters degree in computer science and is a 
frequent presenter in industry conferences on topics of repositories, 
databases, component software and distributed object technology.
