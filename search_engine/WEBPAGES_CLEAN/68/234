       Rules and Examples        

 
    The  for  loop defines a loop parameter which takes on the type of the range
specified. For example, the range  0 to 3  implies an integer:
 process (A)
begin
	Z &lt;= "0000";
	for I in o to 3 loop
		if (A = I) then
			Z(I) &lt;= '1';
		end if;
	end loop;
end process;
 
     
  

 
    Attributes such as  'high, 'low  and  'range  may also be
used to define the iterations of a  for  loop:
 process (A)#
	variable TMP : std_ulogic;
begin
	TMP := '0';
	for I in A'low to A'high loop
		TMP := TMP xor A(I);
	end loop;
	ODD &lt;= TMP;
end process;
  
    
  

 
    The range may be any discrete range, e.g. an enumerated type:
 type PRIMARY is (RED, GREEN, BLUE);
type COLOUR is ARRAY (PRIMARY) of integer range 0 to 255;
-- other statements
MUX: process
begin
	for SEL in PRIMARY loop
		V_BUS &lt;= VIDEO(SEL);
		wait for 10 ns;
	end loop;
end process MUX;
  
    
  

 
    The loop parameter does not need to be declared: it is implicitly
declared within the loop. It may not be modified within the loop:
 for I in 1 to 10 loop
	if (REPEAT = '1') then
		I := I-1;	-- Illegal
	end if;
end loop;
  
    
  

 
       Synthesis Issues       
The for loop is supported for synthesis, providing:
  the loop range is static (i.e. implies a definite number of iterations), and
  the loop contains no  wait  statements.
       

  
       Whats New in '93        
The for ... loop statement has not changed in  VHDL -93
