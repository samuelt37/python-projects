 Streaming  k -means on Well-Clusterable Data 
 Michael Shindler 

 One of the central problems in data-analysis is  k -means
clustering. We study the problem under the  streaming  variant,
in which we may read the input only once and must use only a small
amount of memory. Our result uses the assumption of  data
separability , which closely reflects how  k -means is used in
practice. We show a near-optimal streaming approximation algorithm for
 k -means with sublinear memory and a single pass, under the data
separability assumption. Our algorithm offers significant improvements
in both space and running time over previous work while yielding
asymptotically best-possible performance.  We also show several related
results, including a method to convert any constant approximation to be
more accurate on well-clusterable data.
