 Algorithms<body> CS 263, Winter 2017:  Analysis of Algorithms  This course covers recent topics in algorithms research: What you
need to know to do research in this area, and probably didn't learn
from your undergraduate algorithms class. It meets Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, 2:00-2:50, in  MSTB 110 . Coursework will consist of weekly homework sets and a final exam.  Previous offerings of this course have focused on randomized
algorithms ( Winter 2012 
and  Spring 2014 ) and approximation algorithms
( Spring 2015 ). For this offering we will
focus on computational hardness assumptions beyond P ≠ NP
including  3SUM ,
triangle-finding and shortest paths,
the  exponential
time hypothesis ,
and  unique
games .

  Additionally, we will not be meeting for January 27 – February
3 (four lectures).  Rough schedule, to be made more detailed as the quarter progresses:    Week 1:  
  Introduction: Why do algorithms have the time bounds they do? 
  The  subset
    sum problem  (see
    also:  Koiliaris and Xu ,
    and Section 3
    of  Woeginger ).
   The  3SUM  problem. 
   Models of computation:
    the  real RAM  and
    the  word
    RAM . 
    Homework 1, due at the start of class Friday,
    January 20 . 
     Week 2:  
   Holiday Monday (Martin Luther King Jr. Day) 
   Slightly-subquadratic
     word RAM 
    and  real RAM 
    algorithms for 3SUM. 
    Week 3:  
    Subcubic
     equivalences between path, matrix and triangle problems  
    Faster min-plus matrix
     multiplication 
     and  its
     applications in dynamic programming  
    Connections between
    triangle finding and 3SUM  
    Homework 2, due at the start of class Friday,
    February 10 . 
    Week 4:  
   (No lectures.) 
    Week 5:  
   Backtracking algorithms for NP-complete problems (example:
   3-coloring ) 
   Random walks in solution space ( original paper ;  lecture notes )
    The
  Bellman–Held–Karp dynamic programming algorithm for the
  traveling salesman problem  
    Homework 3, due at the start of class Friday,
    February 17 . 
     Weeks 6-7:  
   Inclusion-exclusion 
   Fixed-parameter tractability 
   The exponential time hypothesis 
    Weeks 8-10:  
   Approximation algorithms, primal-dual and semidefinite
    approximation, inapprobility, and the unique games conjecture
