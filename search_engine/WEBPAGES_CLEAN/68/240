Traveling salesman and hamiltonian cycle problems 
 
   Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188. 
 
For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

    Approximation algorithms for geometric problems .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  
 Approximation Algorithms for NP-hard Problems  ,
 D. Hochbaum , ed.,
PWS Publishing, 1996, pp. 296–345.
 
Considers problems for which no polynomial-time exact algorithms
are known, and concentrates on bounds for worst-case approximation
ratios, especially those depending intrinsically on geometry
rather than on more general graph theoretic or metric space formulations.
Includes sections on the
 traveling salesman problem ,
Steiner trees,
 minimum weight triangulation ,
clustering, and separation problems.

    Fast hierarchical
clustering and other applications of dynamic closest pairs . 
D. Eppstein.

San Francisco, 1998, pp. 619–628 .  arXiv:cs.DS/9912014 .   J. Experimental
Algorithmics  5 (1): 1–23, 2000 .
 
This paper shows how to use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " for some non-geometric problems including
hierarchical clustering,
 greedy matching ,
and  TSP heuristics .
Experiments show variants of my data structures to be faster than
previously used heuristics.

We find improved  exponential-time
algorithms  for exact solution of the
 traveling salesman problem 
on graphs of maximum degree three and four.
We also consider related problems including counting the number of
Hamiltonian cycles in such graphs.

We describe a new algorithm, based on
 graph matching ,
for subdividing a
 triangle mesh  (without boundary)
so that it has a
 Hamiltonian cycle  of triangles, and prove that
this subdivision process increases the total number of triangles
in the mesh by at most a factor of 3/2.  We also prove lower bounds
on the increase needed for meshes with and without boundary.

This follows on to our previous paper on
 using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip  by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.
