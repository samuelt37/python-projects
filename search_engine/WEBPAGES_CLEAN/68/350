I have now moved again. Please click  here  for my new coordinates!

I graduated with my PhD in Computer Science at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, UCI. I was a member of the  theory group at UCI ; my advisor was  Sandy Irani . After spending some time  at  Tata Research Development and Design Centre ,  an industrial research lab, I am back in academia as a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (details above).
