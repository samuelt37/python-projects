             Projects 
          


   
     At UCI, we have written a number of freely available tools to assist in development of software using sound architectural principles.  For information on older software architecture projects developed at UCI, please see our  legacy software  page.  
   

     Apigen 
   
      Apigen  is an  XML schema -to- Java  data binding generator for  xArch schemas  that automatically generate those libraries based only on the XML schemas. 
   

     ArchEvol 
   
   
      ArchEvol  unifies architectural development with implementation by providing the means of maintaining a consistent linking between  architectural and source code  entities throughout software evolution. ArchEvol does not solve the problem of consistency between architecture and implementation by itself, but instead provides the necessary tool support. 
   
   

     ArchStudio 3.0 
   
   
      ArchStudio 3  is an architecture-driven software development environment written in  Java .  It is designed to provide a number of well-integrated tools to promote sound software architecture practices. While ArchStudio is written in the  C2 architectural style , it can model many different architectural styles.  ArchStudio 3.0 contains the latest version of the  c2.fw  framework and  KLAX .  It includes support for the  xADL 2.0  architecture description language.   You may download the latest version of our software from the  Software Update  page. 
   
   

     EASEL 
   
   
      EASEL  is a layer-based design environment. While many environments have focused primarily on   documenting a design   (i.e.  after  it has been created), the goal of EASEL is to support a designer in the  activity of designing : a naturally iterative process consisting of creatively constructing, evaluating, and improving alternatives that eventually coalesce into a single, desired solution. 
   
   
  
     PACE 
   
   
      PACE  is an architectural style for  trust management in decentralized applications . PACE provides a set of principles and constraints that
provide comprehensive guidance on what trust components to include, how
to place these components appropriately within the architecture of a
decentralized entity, and how these components should interact for
effective trust management. 
   
   
  
     xADL 2.0 
   
   
      xADL 2.0  is a set of libraries that provide a convenient interface in  Java  to  xArch  and  xADL 2.0 extensions .
