   Abstract:  
Since register files suffer from some of the highest power
densities within processors, designers have investigated several
architectural strategies for register file power reduction,
including "On Demand RF Read" where the register
file is read only if the operand value is not available from
the bypasses. However, we show in this paper that significant
additional reductions in the register file power consumption
can be obtained by scheduling instructions so that
they transfer the operands via bypasses, rather than reading
from the register file. Such instruction scheduling requires
the compiler to be cognizant of the bypasses in the processor
pipeline. In this paper, we develop several bypass aware
instruction scheduling heuristics varying in time complexity,
and study their effectiveness on the Intel XScale processor
pipeline running MiBench benchmarks. Our experimental
results show additional power consumption reductions of
up to 26% and on average 12% over and above the register
file power reduction achieved through existing techniques.
