  Generating a key on a *NIX  
 

 

These instructions apply to  OS  X and Linux.
 
  ssh-keygen   -t  dsa  -C   "user@school.edu"  
 
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
70:85:4f:e5:91:b8:ab:a4:95:ce:fb:df:11:75:df:de user@school.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ DSA 1024]----+
|         ..oo.   |
|        ..o...   |
|      . .o ..   o|
|       o  o    .+|
|        S. .  . o|
|        + .    o.|
|       * .    . E|
|      . +    . . |
|        .o... .  |

  Generating a key on Windows  
 

 

Use the utility called Putty Key Generator.
 

 
Generate &gt; save private key.
 

 
To share the public key:
 
    copy the text in the text box into a clipboard 
 
   paste the text from the clipboard into a text file and save that file 
 
   share the saved file 
 
  

Remarks:
 
    For those using SourceTree as a Git client, Putty Key Generator is included under Tools. 
 
   Do not use Putty Key Generator's save public key feature, that won't work. 
 
  

  The config file  
 
   config  
  
Host redwood
    HostName redwood.ics.uci.edu
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/school_rsa   # Only need if you have multiple keys
 
     config  
  
Host family-guy
    HostName family-guy.ics.uci.edu
    User &lt;user&gt;
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/school_rsa   # Only need if you have multiple keys
