  Formatting Syntax  
 

 

 DokuWiki  supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the datafiles to be as readable as possible. This page contains all possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. Simply have a look at the source of this page by pressing the  Edit this page  button at the top or bottom of the page. If you want to try something, just use the  playground  page. The simpler markup is easily accessible via  quickbuttons , too.
 

 

  Basic Text Formatting  
 

 

DokuWiki supports  bold</strong>,  italic ,  underlined  and  monospaced  texts. Of course you can     combine   </strong> all these.

 
 DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts.
Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these. 

 

You can use  subscript  and  superscript , too.

 
 You can use &lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;, too. 

 

You can mark something as  deleted  as well.

 
 You can mark something as &lt;del&gt;deleted&lt;/del&gt; as well. 

 

 Paragraphs</strong> are created from blank lines. If you want to  force a newline</strong> without a paragraph, you can use two backslashes followed by a whitespace or the end of line.
 

 
This is some text with some linebreaks 
Note that the
two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line 

or followed by 
a whitespace \\this happens without it.

 
 This is some text with some linebreaks\\ Note that the
two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line\\
or followed by\\ a whitespace \\this happens without it. 

 

You should use forced newlines only if really needed.
 

 

  Links  
 

 

DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links.
 

 

  External  
 

 

External links are recognized automagically:  http://www.google.com  or simply  www.google.com  - You can set the link text as well:  This Link points to google . Email addresses like this one:  andi@splitbrain.org  are recognized, too.

 
 DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links. External links are recognized
automagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com - You can set
link text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to google]]. Email
addresses like this one: &lt;andi@splitbrain.org&gt; are recognized, too. 

 

  Internal  
 

 

Internal links are created by using square brackets. You can either just give a  pagename  or use an additional  link text .

 
 Internal links are created by using square brackets. You can either just give
a [[pagename]] or use an additional [[pagename|link text]]. 

 

 Wiki pagenames  are converted to lowercase automatically, special characters are not allowed.
 

 
You can use  namespaces  by using a colon in the pagename.

 
 You can use [[some:namespaces]] by using a colon in the pagename. 

 

For details about namespaces see  namespaces .
 

 
Linking to a specific section is possible, too. Just add the section name behind a hash character as known from  HTML . This links to   this Section  .

 
 This links to [[syntax#internal|this Section]]. 

 

Notes:

 
    Links to   existing pages   are shown in a different style from  nonexisting  ones. 
 
   DokuWiki does not use  CamelCase  to automatically create links by default, but this behavior can be enabled in the  config  file. Hint: If DokuWiki is a link, then it's enabled. 
 
   When a section's heading is changed, its bookmark changes, too. So don't rely on section linking too much. 
 
  

  Interwiki  
 

 

DokuWiki supports  Interwiki  links. These are quick links to other Wikis. For example this is a link to Wikipedia's page about Wikis:  Wiki .

 
 DokuWiki supports [[doku&gt;Interwiki]] links. These are quick links to other Wikis.
For example this is a link to Wikipedia's page about Wikis: [[wp&gt;Wiki]]. 

 

  Windows Shares  
 

 

Windows shares like  this  are recognized, too. Please note that these only make sense in a homogeneous user group like a corporate  Intranet .

 
 Windows Shares like [[\\server\share|this]] are recognized, too. 

 

Notes:

 
    For security reasons direct browsing of windows shares only works in Microsoft Internet Explorer per default (and only in the “local zone”). 
 
   For Mozilla and Firefox it can be enabled through different workaround mentioned in the  Mozilla Knowledge Base . 
 
  

  Image Links  
 

 

You can also use an image to link to another internal or external page by combining the syntax for links and  images  (see below) like this:

 
 [[http://www.php.net|{{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png}}]] 

 

   
 

 
Please note: The image formatting is the only formatting syntax accepted in link names.
 

 
The whole  image  and  link  syntax is supported (including image resizing, internal and external images and URLs and interwiki links).
 

 

  Footnotes  
 

 

You can add footnotes   1)   by using double parentheses.

 
 You can add footnotes ((This is a footnote)) by using double parentheses. 

 

  Sectioning  
 

 

You can use up to five different levels of headlines to structure your content. If you have more than three headlines, a table of contents is generated automatically – this can be disabled by including the string  ~~NOTOC~~  in the document.
 

 

  Headline Level 3  
 

 

  Headline Level 4  
 

 

  Headline Level 5  
 
 ==== Headline Level 3 ====
=== Headline Level 4 ===
== Headline Level 5 == 

 

By using four or more dashes, you can make a horizontal line:

 
  

  Images and Other Files  
 

 

You can include external and internal  images  with curly brackets. Optionally you can specify the size of them.
 

 
Real size:                           
 

 
Resize to given width:               
 

 
Resize to given width and height  2)  :    
 

 
Resized external image:              

 
 Real size:                        {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png}}
Resize to given width:            {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?50}}
Resize to given width and height: {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?200x50}}
Resized external image:           {{http://de3.php.net/images/php.gif?200x50}} 

 
By using left or right whitespaces you can choose the alignment.
 

 
   
 

 
   
 

 
   

 
 {{ wiki:dokuwiki-128.png}}
{{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png }}
{{ wiki:dokuwiki-128.png }} 

 

Of course, you can add a title (displayed as a tooltip by most browsers), too.
 

 
   

 
 {{ wiki:dokuwiki-128.png |This is the caption}} 

 

If you specify a filename (external or internal) that is not an image ( gif, jpeg, png ), then it will be displayed as a link instead.
 

 
For linking an image to another page see  Image Links  above.
 

 

  Lists  
 

 

Dokuwiki supports ordered and unordered lists. To create a list item, indent your text by two spaces and use a  *  for unordered lists or a  -  for ordered ones.

 
    This is a list 
 
   The second item 
    You may have different levels 
 
  
   Another item 
 
     The same list but ordered 
 
   Another item 
    Just use indention for deeper levels 
 
  
   That's it 
 
  
  * This is a list
  * The second item
    * You may have different levels
  * Another item

  - The same list but ordered
  - Another item
    - Just use indention for deeper levels
  - That's it
 

 
Also take a look at the  FAQ on list items .
 

 

  Text Conversions  
 

 

DokuWiki can convert certain pre-defined characters or strings into images or other text or  HTML .
 

 
The text to image conversion is mainly done for smileys. And the text to  HTML  conversion is used for typography replacements, but can be configured to use other  HTML  as well.
 

 

  Text to Image Conversions  
 

 

DokuWiki converts commonly used  emoticon s to their graphical equivalents. Those  Smileys  and other images can be configured and extended. Here is an overview of Smileys included in DokuWiki:

 
        8-)   
 
       8-O   
 
       :-(   
 
       :-)   
 
        =)    
 
       :-/   
 
       :-\   
 
       :-?   
 
       :-D   
 
       :-P   
 
       :-O   
 
       :-X   
 
       :-|   
 
       ;-)   
 
       ^_^   
 
       :?:   
 
       :!:   
 
       LOL   
 
       FIXME  
 
      DELETEME  
 
  

  Text to HTML Conversions  
 

 

Typography:  DokuWiki  can convert simple text characters to their typographically correct entities. Here is an example of recognized characters.
 

 
→ ← ↔ ⇒ ⇐ ⇔ » « – — 640×480 © ™ ®
“He thought 'It's a man's world'…”
 
 
-&gt; &lt;- &lt;-&gt; =&gt; &lt;= &lt;=&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; -- --- 640x480 (c) (tm) (r)
"He thought 'It's a man's world'..."
 

 
The same can be done to produce any kind of  HTML , it just needs to be added to the  pattern file .
 

 
There are three exceptions which do not come from that pattern file: multiplication entity (640×480), 'single' and “double quotes”. They can be turned off through a  config option .
 

 

  Quoting  
 

 

Some times you want to mark some text to show it's a reply or comment. You can use the following syntax:

 
 I think we should do it

&gt; No we shouldn't

&gt;&gt; Well, I say we should

&gt; Really?

&gt;&gt; Yes!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then lets do it! 

 

I think we should do it

 
  
 No we shouldn't  
  
  
 Well, I say we should  
  
  
 Really?  
  
  
 Yes!  
  
  
  
  
 Then lets do it!  
  
  

 

  Tables  
 

 

DokuWiki supports a simple syntax to create tables.

 
    Heading 1         Heading 2          Heading 3           
	    Row 1 Col 1       Row 1 Col 2        Row 1 Col 3         
	    Row 2 Col 1       some colspan (note the double pipe)  
	    Row 3 Col 1       Row 3 Col 2        Row 3 Col 3         
	   

Table rows have to start and end with a  |  for normal rows or a  ^  for headers.

 
 ^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2       ^ Heading 3          ^
| Row 1 Col 1    | Row 1 Col 2     | Row 1 Col 3        |
| Row 2 Col 1    | some colspan (note the double pipe) ||
| Row 3 Col 1    | Row 3 Col 2     | Row 3 Col 3        | 

 

To connect cells horizontally, just make the next cell completely empty as shown above. Be sure to have always the same amount of cell separators!
 

 
Vertical tableheaders are possible, too.

 
                    Heading 1               Heading 2           
	    Heading 3       Row 1 Col 2             Row 1 Col 3         
	    Heading 4       no colspan this time                        
	    Heading 5       Row 2 Col 2             Row 2 Col 3         
	   

As you can see, it's the cell separator before a cell which decides about the formatting:

 
 |              ^ Heading 1            ^ Heading 2          ^
^ Heading 3    | Row 1 Col 2          | Row 1 Col 3        |
^ Heading 4    | no colspan this time |                    |
^ Heading 5    | Row 2 Col 2          | Row 2 Col 3        | 

 

You can have rowspans (vertically connected cells) by adding  :::  into the cells below the one to which they should connect.

 
    Heading 1         Heading 2                     Heading 3           
	    Row 1 Col 1       this cell spans vertically    Row 1 Col 3         
	    Row 2 Col 1       Row 2 Col 3         
	    Row 3 Col 1       Row 2 Col 3         
	   

Apart from the rowspan syntax those cells should not contain anything else.

 
 ^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2                  ^ Heading 3          ^
| Row 1 Col 1    | this cell spans vertically | Row 1 Col 3        |
| Row 2 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        |
| Row 3 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        | 

 

You can align the table contents, too. Just add at least two whitespaces at the opposite end of your text: Add two spaces on the left to align right, two spaces on the right to align left and two spaces at least at both ends for centered text.

 
              Table with alignment            
	            right      center      left           
	   left                     right      center     
	    xxxxxxxxxxxx    xxxxxxxxxxxx    xxxxxxxxxxxx  
	   

This is how it looks in the source:

 
 ^           Table with alignment           ^^^
|         right|    center    |left          |
|left          |         right|    center    |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | 

 

Note: Vertical alignment is not supported.
 

 

  No Formatting  
 

 

If you need to display text exactly like it is typed (without any formatting), enclose the area either with  &lt;nowiki&gt;  tags or even simpler, with double percent signs  %% .
 

 

This is some text which contains addresses like this: http://www.splitbrain.org and **formatting**, but nothing is done with it.

The same is true for //__this__ text// with a smiley ;-).

 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
This is some text which contains addresses like this: http://www.splitbrain.org and **formatting**, but nothing is done with it.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The same is true for %%//__this__ text// with a smiley ;-)%%. 

 

  Code Blocks  
 

 

You can include code blocks into your documents by either indenting them by at least two spaces (like used for the previous examples) or by using the tags  &lt;code&gt;  or  &lt;file&gt; .

 
 This is text is indented by two spaces. 
 
This is preformatted code all spaces are preserved: like              &lt;-this
 
 
This is pretty much the same, but you could use it to show that you quoted a file.

&lt;/code&gt; 
 &lt;file&gt;
This is pretty much the same, but you could use it to show that you quoted a file.
&lt;/file&gt; 

 

  Syntax Highlighting  
 

 

 DokuWiki  can highlight sourcecode, which makes it easier to read. It uses the  GeSHi  Generic Syntax Highlighter – so any language supported by GeSHi is supported. The syntax is the same like in the code and file blocks in the previous section, but this time the name of the used language is inserted inside the tag. Eg.  &lt;code java&gt;  or  &lt;file java&gt; .
 
  /**
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
 */ 
 class  HelloWorldApp  { 
     public   static   void  main (   String   [  ]  args )   { 
          System  . out . println  (  "Hello World!"  )  ;   //Display the string. 
     } 
 }  

 
The following language strings are currently recognized:  abap, actionscript-french, actionscript, actionscript3, ada, apache, applescript, asm, asp, autoit, avisynth, bash, basic4gl, bf, bibtex, blitzbasic, bnf, boo, c, c_mac, caddcl, cadlisp, cfdg, cfm, cil, cmake, cobol, cpp, cpp-qt, csharp, css, d, dcs, delphi, diff, div, dos, dot, eiffel, email, erlang, fo, fortran, freebasic, genero, glsl, gml, gnuplot, groovy, gettext, haskell, hq9plus, html, idl, ini, inno, intercal, io, java5, java, javascript, kixtart, klonec, klonecpp, latex, lisp, locobasic, lolcode, lotusformulas, lotusscript, lscript, lsl2, lua, m68k, make, matlab, mirc, modula3, mpasm, mxml, mysql, nsis, oberon2, objc, ocaml-brief, ocaml, oobas, oracle8, oracle11, pascal, perl, per, php-brief, php, pic16, pixelbender, plsql, povray, powershell, progress, prolog, properties, providex, python, qbasic, rails, rebol, reg, robots, ruby, sas, scala, scheme, scilab, sdlbasic, smalltalk, smarty, sql, tcl, teraterm, text, thinbasic, tsql, typoscript, vbnet, vb, verilog, vhdl, vim, visualfoxpro, visualprolog, whitespace, winbatch, whois, xml, xorg_conf, xpp, z80 
 

 

  Downloadable Code Blocks  
 

 

When you use the  &lt;code&gt;  or  &lt;file&gt;  syntax as above, you might want to make the shown code available for download as well. You can to this by specifying a file name after language code like this:
 
 
&lt;file php myexample.php&gt;
&lt;?php echo "hello world!"; ?&gt;
&lt;/file&gt;
 
   myexample.php  
   &lt;?php   echo   "hello world!"  ;   ?&gt;  
   
If you don't want any highlighting but want a downloadable file, specify a dash ( - ) as the language code:  &lt;code - myfile.foo&gt; .
 

 

  Embedding HTML and PHP  
 

 

You can embed raw  HTML  or  PHP  code into your documents by using the  &lt;html&gt;  or  &lt;php&gt;  tags. (Use uppercase tags if you need to enclose block level elements.)
 

 
 HTML  example:
 
 
&lt;html&gt;
This is some &lt;span style="color:red;font-size:150%;"&gt;inline HTML&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;p style="border:2px dashed red;"&gt;And this is some block HTML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
 

 
 This is some  &lt;  span    style  =  "color:red;font-size:150%;" &gt; inline HTML &lt; /   span  &gt;  

 
  &lt;  p    style  =  "border:2px dashed red;" &gt; And this is some block HTML &lt; /   p  &gt;  
 
 PHP  example:
 
 
&lt;php&gt;
echo 'A logo generated by PHP:';
echo '&lt;img src="' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . '?=' . php_logo_guid() . '" alt="PHP Logo !" /&gt;';
echo '(generated inline HTML)';
&lt;/php&gt;
&lt;PHP&gt;
echo '&lt;table class="inline"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The same, but inside a block level element:&lt;/td&gt;';
echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . '?=' . php_logo_guid() . '" alt="PHP Logo !" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';
echo '&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;';
&lt;/PHP&gt;
 

 
  echo   'A logo generated by PHP:'  ; 
 echo   '&lt;img src="'   .   $_SERVER  [  'PHP_SELF'  ]   .   '?='   .    php_logo_guid   (  )   .   '" alt="PHP Logo !" /&gt;'  ; 
 echo   '(inline HTML)'  ;  

 
  echo   '&lt;table class="inline"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The same, but inside a block level element:&lt;/td&gt;'  ; 
 echo   '&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="'   .   $_SERVER  [  'PHP_SELF'  ]   .   '?='   .    php_logo_guid   (  )   .   '" alt="PHP Logo !" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;'  ; 
 echo   '&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;'  ;  
 
 Please Note</strong>:  HTML  and  PHP  embedding is disabled by default in the configuration. If disabled, the code is displayed instead of executed.
 

 

  RSS/ATOM Feed Aggregation  
 

 
 DokuWiki  can integrate data from external  XML  feeds. For parsing the  XML  feeds,  SimplePie  is used. All formats understood by SimplePie can be used in DokuWiki as well. You can influence the rendering by multiple additional space separated parameters:

 
    Parameter     Description  
	    any number    will be used as maximum number items to show, defaults to 8  
	    reverse       display the last items in the feed first  
	    author        show item authors names  
	    date          show item dates  
	    description   show the item description. If  HTML  is disabled all tags will be stripped  
	     n [dhm]    refresh period, where d=days, h=hours, m=minutes. (e.g. 12h = 12 hours).  
	   

The refresh period defaults to 4 hours. Any value below 10 minutes will be treated as 10 minutes.  DokuWiki  will generally try to supply a cached version of a page, obviously this is inappropriate when the page contains dynamic external content. The parameter tells  DokuWiki  to re-render the page if it is more than  refresh period  since the page was last rendered.
 

 
 Example:</strong>

 
 {{rss&gt;http://slashdot.org/index.rss 5 author date 1h }} 
    An error occurred while fetching this feed:   http://slashdot.org/index.rss     

  Control Macros  
 

 

Some syntax influences how DokuWiki renders a page without creating any output it self. The following control macros are availble:

 
    Macro              Description  
	    ~~NOTOC~~      If this macro is found on the page, no table of contents will be created  
	    ~~NOCACHE~~    DokuWiki caches all output by default. Sometimes this might not be wanted (eg. when the &lt;php&gt; syntax above is used), adding this macro will force DokuWiki to rerender a page on every call  
	   

  Syntax Plugins  
 

 

DokuWiki's syntax can be extended by  Plugins . How the installed plugins are used is described on their appropriate description pages. The following syntax plugins are available in this particular DokuWiki installation:
 
    orphanswanted plugin   2012-12-05  by  Doug Edmunds, Cyrille37, Federico Ariel Castagnini, Andy Webber, Matthias Schulte  Display Orphans, Wanteds and Valid link information     MathJax plugin   2012-12-08  by  Mark Liffiton  Enables MathJax (http://mathjax.org/) parsing of TeX math expressions in wiki pages     Info Plugin   2008-09-12  by  Andreas Gohr  Displays information about various DokuWiki internals

This is a footnote 
   2)   
when the aspect ratio of the given width and height doesn't match that of the image, it will be cropped to the new ratio before resizing
