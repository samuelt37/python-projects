    1.   (a)   Below is a partially completed table giving A u B,
    A n B, |A u B|, and |A n B| for various 
    sets A and B.  (Assume that a,b,c,... refer to distinct objects. Note 
    that I am using n and u as a rough approximation to the union and 
    intersection symbols due to limitations in web browser technology.
    Complete the table.

 Can you give a formula for |A u B| in terms 
of |A|, |B|, and |A n B|?  If so, explain why it is true.

   
Answer: |A  u  B| = |A| + |B| - |A  n  B|.

  If you add |A| + |B|, everything in A u  B gets
counted at least once, but some members get counted twice.
The elements counted twice are the ones in both A and B, so subtracting
|A  n  B| makes up for this overcounting and counts
everything in A  u  B exactly once.
    
 
        2.   We discussed the power set P(S) of a set S in class. An 
example of a power set is
 
P({black,white}) = { Ø, {black}, {white}, {black,white} }.
       (a)   List the elements of the power set of 
{blue,red,yellow}.

   
Answer: Ø, {blue}, {red}, {yellow}, {red,yellow}, {blue,yellow},
{blue,red}, {blue,red,yellow}
   
      (b)   What is the size of the power set of 
{puce,turquoise,taupe,khaki,lime,cyan,emerald}?  (You do not have to list 
all the elements of the power
set, just give its size.)

   
Answer: the set has 7 members, so its power set has
2 7  = 128 members.
   
         3.   Write out the mathematical notation used as 
shorthand for the following phrases.      (a)   x is not a member of the empty set.      (b)   The empty set is a subset of the powerset of U.      (c)   The intersection of A and B is equal to the union 
of C and D.      (d)   The complement of X is a superset of Y.      (e)   X is the set of ordered pairs in which the first 
item in the pair is taken from set Y and the second item is taken 
from set Z.

   
Answer:
      
         4.   Let R be the relation between people and the cars 
they own; that is, the pair (x,y) is in R if x is a person, y is a car, 
and x owns y.  Does R represent a function?  Why or why not?        
   
Answer: No, because a relation on two sets X and Y is only a function when
each member of X is on the left hand side of exactly one pair.
But in this example, some people are not in any pairs
(they don't own any cars), or are in more than one pair
(they own more than one car).
