 Geometry in Action<body>
 
   
 

   This page collects various areas in which ideas from discrete
and computational geometry (meaning mainly low-dimensional
Euclidean geometry) meet some real world applications. It contains
brief descriptions of those applications and the geometric
questions arising from them, as well as pointers to web pages on
the applications themselves and on their geometric connections.
This is largely organized by application but some major general
techniques are also listed as topics. Suggestions for other
applications and pointers are welcome.
