 ICS Alumni Hall of Fame 

 
 

   
 In 2015, UCI celebrated its 50th anniversary as one of the nation’s leading universities. To honor those who made a significant impact in their profession, or in other ways have brought distinction to their alma mater, the Samueli School of Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences recognized 54 illustrious alumni by inducting them into the 2015 Hall of Fame. Now as ICS continues the tradition, we are once again asking you to  nominate an exceptional alumnus or alumna who has made a significant impact in their profession or, in other ways, have brought distinction to ICS.   
    
   The deadline to submit a nomination is January 1, 2017.</strong>
