            This page represents a checklist of the major criteria
            needed to satisfy different class credit requirements.
            Each requirement can have 3 different status codes:
               Pending  (not yet complete, due date has not passed),
               Complete  (completed before the due date),
               Incomplete  (not completed by the due date and the due date has passed)
              
            Presently there are two major requirement types:
               Assigned Problems :
            Listed on the right.  Each is identified by a number
            and has a corresponding due date and completion status.

               Random (Non-Assigned) Problems :
            Listed in the middle-left, are a set of time periods
            and problem counts.  You must complete the specified
            number of problems within each time period to satisfy
            each requirement.  Note that the assigned problems
            completed on the right do not count towards this total,
            but any other problems will (assuming they fulfill other
            specified criteria, such as having "max steps" set to
            at least 2).
