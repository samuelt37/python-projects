     Biography 
     
           
         
             
                I am a research scientist at Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL). 
                Before that, I obtained my Ph.D in computer science at UC Irvine in 2016, under the supervision of Prof.  Alexander Ihler . 
                Prior to UCI, I received my B.S. in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology, and M.E. in software engineering from Tsinghua University.
