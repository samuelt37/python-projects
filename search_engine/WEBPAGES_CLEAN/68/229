 Abstract  
Complete algorithms for solving propositional satisfiability fall into two main
classes: backtracking search (e.g., the Davis-Putnam Procedure [1]) and 
resolution (e.g., the original Davis-Putnam Algorithm [2] and Directional Resolution
[4]). Backtracking may be viewed as a systematic "guessing" of variable 
assignments, while resolution is inferring, or "thinking". Experimental results show
that "pure guessing" or "pure thinking" might be inefficient. We propose an 
approach that combines both techniques and yields a family of hybrid algorithms,
parameterized by a bound on the "effective" amount of resolution allowed. The
idea is to divide the set of propositional variables into two classes: conditioning
variables, which are assigned truth values, and resolution variables, which are 
resolved upon. We report on preliminary experimental results demonstrating that
on certain classes of problems hybrid algorithms are more efficient than either
of their components in isolation.
