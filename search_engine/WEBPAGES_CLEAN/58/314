 On Space Efficient Two Dimensional Range Minimum Data Structures 
 Darren Strash 

 The two dimensional range minimum query problem is to preprocess a
static two-dimensional matrix  A  with  N  elements so that reporting
the minimum element in a rectangular range can be done efficiently. We
show that every algorithm enabled to access  A  during the query
and using O( N / c ) bits additional space requires
Ω( c ) query time, for any  c  where
1 ≤  c  ≤  N . This lower bound
holds for any dimension. In two dimensions, we complement the lower
bound with an indexing data structure of size O( N / c ) bits
additional space which can be preprocessed in O( N ) time and
achieves O( c  log 2   c ) query
time. Taking  c  to be O(1), this is the first O(1) query time
algorithm using optimal O( N ) bits additional space.
