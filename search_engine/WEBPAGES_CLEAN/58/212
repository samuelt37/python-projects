 Abstract  
Local consistency has proven to be an important concept in
the theory and practice of constraint networks. In this paper, we present
a new definition of local consistency, called relational consistency. The
new definition is relation-based, in contrast with the previous definition of
local consistency, which we characterize as variable-based. We show the
conceptual power of the new definition by showing how it unifies known
elimination operators such as resolution in theorem proving, joins in relational 
databases, and variable elimination for solving linear inequalities.
Algorithms for enforcing various levels of relational consistency are 
introduced and analyzed. We also show the usefulness of the new definition
in characterizing relationships between properties of constraint networks and 
the level of local consistency needed to ensure global consistency.
