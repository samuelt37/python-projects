Title: 
Dynamic Point Location with Sub-Logarithmic Local Updates
 

 
Presenting ongoing work with Maarten and Darren.

  
Abstract: 
We consider the problem of dynamic point location among imprecision
regions. That is, we are given a set of n points whose location we
only know approximately, and
we maintain a set of n regions whose size depends on the precision of
the corresponding point.
We support point location queries among these regions and insertions
and deletions of regions in O(log n) time. We also support local
updates to re-size or move a region in sub-logarithmic time.
