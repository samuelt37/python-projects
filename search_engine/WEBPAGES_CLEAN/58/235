 COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
 The course will provide a basic introduction to modern time series analysis. We will cover time series regression and exploratory data analysis, ARMA/ARIMA models, model identification/estimation/linear operators, Fourier analysis, spectral estimation, and state space models. The Analyses will be performed using the freely available package astsa, which accompanies the book. Both R and RStudio will be required for this class. 
 
 
 
 OBJECTIVES: 
 Learn basic analysis of time series data; learn basic concepts in time series regression; learn auto-regressive and model averaging models; learn basic concepts of spectral analysis and space-time models; utilize R for computation, visualization, and analysis of time series data. 
 
 REQUIREMENTS: 
 Corequisite: STATS 200C.
