  Abstract  

The development of user interfaces for large applications is subject to 
a series of well-known problems including cost, maintainability, and 
sensitivity to changes in the operating environment.  The  Chiron 
(pronounced  ky-ron ) user interface management sytem (UIMS) has been 
built to address these software engineering concerns.  Chiron has been
designed with the following goals in mind:
   Architectural extensibility and flexibility.
   Robustness in the presence of change.
   Facilitation of software reuse.
   Support for concurrency.
   Performance.
