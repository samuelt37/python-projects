  Ipe tutorial  
 

 
This is more of a random list of how-to topics than a tutorial.
 

 

  Warning: never put quote characters (") in the name of a layer; Ipe will die.  
 

 

  How to fix it:  
 

 
Internally, Ipe saves files as xml. Even if you save it as a pdf, Ipe will embed the xml inside the pdf. Ipe must be able to parse this xml in order to properly load a file. However, if you put (”) characters in places that get written as metadata, Ipe will not be able to parse the xml. You will get poorly formatted xml that looks like this:
 
 
&lt;page title="&amp;apos;this&amp;quot; is fixed for titles"&gt;
&lt;layer name="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;view layers="don't_do_"this"" active="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;text layer="don't_do_"this"" transformations="translations" pos="128 704" stroke="black" type="label" width="36.862" height="6.128" depth="0" valign="baseline"&gt;test text&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
 

 

When you try and open this file, you will get an error like this:

 
   Document '/home/jsimons/Desktop/bad_ipe.ipe' could not be opened
  Parsing error at position 6051 

 

Ipe is helpfully trying to tell you which character the xml parser failed on. To fix it, you have to manually edit the xml. If you saved as .ipe, then just open up the file in your favorite text editor and remove the extra quotes from the xml. If you saved it as a pdf, you first have to extract the xml from the pdf (since in the pdf its saved as a byte stream, you can't see the plain text). One easy way to do this is to  run ipetoipe.</strong>
 

 

  Stylesheets  
 

 

Stylesheets are text files that can be included in an Ipe document to customize or add functionality not available directly through Ipe. Stylesheets work a bit like preambles in LaTeX. Multiple stylesheets can be used in one Ipe document. They can be used to customize a document or define general-purpose objects to be reused over multiple documents. 
 

 
The workflow of using stylesheets:

 
    Create or open a stylesheet in a text editor. Here is a barebones example:    my-stylesheet.isy  
    &lt;ipestyle   name = "my-stylesheet"  &gt;  
 &lt;!--ipe customization--&gt; 
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   
 
   Edit it. Some examples of things to add can be found in this tutorial. 
 
   Save it. 
 
   Include it in the Ipe document: in Ipe, go to  Edit &gt; Style sheets &gt; Add</strong>. 
 
   Update it: in Ipe, click  Edit &gt; Update style sheets</strong>. This must be done everytime an included stylesheet is modified. 
 
  

  LaTeX packages  
 

 

To include a LaTeX package in Ipe, go to  Edit &gt; Document Properties &gt; Latex preamble</strong> and add the LaTeX command  \usepackage{my-package} .
 

 
Alternatively, add the following in a stylesheet:
 
   &lt;preamble &gt;   
\usepackage{my-package}
  &lt;/preamble &gt;    

 
You can also put whatever LaTeX commands usually go in the preamble of a LaTeX document in the  &lt;preamble&gt;  tags, such as  \input{} ,  \newcommand{} , etc.
 

 

  Transparency  
 
   transparency.isy  
    &lt;ipestyle   name = "transparency"  &gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "75%"   value = "0.75"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "50%"   value = "0.5"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "25%"   value = "0.25"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "10%"   value = "0.1"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "20%"   value = "0.2"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "30%"   value = "0.3"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "40%"   value = "0.4"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "60%"   value = "0.6"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "70%"   value = "0.7"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "80%"   value = "0.8"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "90%"   value = "0.9"  /&gt;  
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   

  Gradient  
 

 
Here is an example code snippet to include in your stylesheet:
 
   &lt;gradient   name = "mygradient"   type = "axial"   extend = "yes"   coords = "0 0 0 600"  &gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.25"   color = "0.8 0.9 0.8"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.48"   color = "1 1 1"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.58"   color = "1 1 1"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.75"   color = "0.8 0.9 0.8"  /&gt;  
  &lt;/gradient &gt;    

 
Axial means the gradient is along a single direction. The other option is radial (needs to checked). The coordinates specify the two endpoints of the direction vector. The stops represent the different points along the direction vector at which color should change.
 

 
Once the stylesheet uploaded, the gradient option should show up in the context menu of objects that can have a gradient fill.
 

 

  Ipe presentation background  
 

 

To use an Ipe drawing as a background:

 
    group the objects of the drawing 
 
   copy the  XML  code of the group object 
 
   paste it inside the following code snippet in your Ipe stylesheet:   &lt;symbol   name = "Background"   xform = "yes"  &gt;  
 &lt;!--insert XML here--&gt; 
  &lt;/symbol &gt;    
 
 
  
The symbol name has to be  Background</strong> spelled exactly that way. The xform option allows you to only store a single copy of the background in the  PDF  file.
 

 
To turn off the background on a specific page, add a layer called  BACKGROUND</strong>. Setting that layer to visible/invisible seems to have no effect.
 

 

  Ipe presentation title  
 

 
Add something like this to your stylesheet.
 
   &lt;color   name = "titlecolor"   value = "1 0.5 0.5"  /&gt;  
  &lt;textsize   name = "titlesize"   value = "\large\bf"   /&gt;  
  &lt;textstretch   name = "titlesize"   value = "2.8"   /&gt;  
  &lt;titlestyle   pos = "25 554"   size = "titlesize"   color = "titlecolor"   halign = "left"   valign = "baseline"   /&gt;   

 

The  textsize  allows you to specify the LaTeX code for the font you want to use. The  textstretch  specifies how much to magnify the LaTex generated text, which is useful to enlargen text in a presentation. The  titlestyle  is where you specify the appearance and position of your title text.
 

 
The  textsize  and  textstretch  can be used alone to define a text style (size and shape). They simply have to have the same  name  attribute. This is a little hacky because this was only meant to define a text size and not text style.
 

 

  CGAL ipelets  
 

 
This is assuming that ipe is already installed and runs successfully.
 

 
On debian:
 
 0. Make sure you have cmake
    * $ sudo apt-get install cmake 
1. Get the required cgal library packages and all their dependencies
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
2. Get the demos and examples files
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-demo
    * For me, the demo was installed to /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/
3. Unpack the demo tar somewhere reasonable
    * $ mkdir ~/CGAL
    * $ cd ~/CGAL
    * $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/demo.tar.gz
4. Prepare the demos to be compiled
    * $ cd demo
    * $ cmake .
5. Compile the demo(s). 
To make just the ipelets, go to the ready-to-compile subdirectory (yes, it's another nested level, demo/demo/), and make.
It will take a few minutes to compile all the ipelets
    * $ cd ~/CGAL/demo/demo/CGAL_ipelets/
    * $ make
6. Copy the compiled output '*.so' files and the '*.lua' into the ipelet directory. 
   On the default 7.1.3 ipe installation, the command is:
    * $ sudo find . -name '*.so' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
    * $ sudo find ~/CGAL/demo/CGAL_ipelets/lua/ -name '*.lua' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
