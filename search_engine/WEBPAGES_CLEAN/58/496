 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Jimage CLASSPATH setup for Windows NT<body>
 

 Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include jimage 

  
This section will explain how to set the CLASSPATH environment variable.
CLASSPATH is used by the Java interpretor to
determine where it looks for java byte-code.  The screen shots below show
the setting of CLASSPATH for the file chimera.zip, but you can use 
the same procedure to add jimage to the variable.
 

 Setting the CLASSPATH Environment Variable 

  Follow the following steps to access the area in NT where the
environment variables are located.
 

   Open the Control Panel.
           

       Double click the System icon from the Control Panel window.
           
	The Systems Properties window should appear.  

       Click on the Environment tab.  This will display the
        information about the environment variables used.
           
	Add the variable CLASSPATH and type in the location of 
	jimage. (Note: The screen shot shows chimera.zip as the
	file added to CLASSPATH, you should add the 
	location of jimage instead.)
    You now should have the jimage set for your Java interpretor.
