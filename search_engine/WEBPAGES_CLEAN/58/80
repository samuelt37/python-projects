&gt; Sometimes you can get people to agree on the answer even when they
&gt; can't agree on the question. So I'm not so worried about divergent
&gt; goals. On the other hand, a Functional Requirements document would be
&gt; the right way to deal with the issue of common goals. Does someone
&gt; (not me) want to draft a Functional Requirements document and submit
&gt; it by next Thursday as an Internet Draft? (Mainly just to raise
&gt; awareness of the issue.)

Larry, this sounds like a good idea.  My only question is, under
who's aegis will the ID be posted?  Is it an "individual
submission", or will it be posted as an HTTP WG ID?
