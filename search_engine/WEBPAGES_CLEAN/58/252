    Separating thickness from geometric thickness . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0204252 . 
10th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Irvine, 2002. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  2528, 2002, pp. 150–161. 
In  Towards a Theory of Geometric Graphs , AMS, 2004, Contemporary
Math 342, J. Pach, ed., pp. 75–86.
 
We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments
similar to those in
" Separating book thickness from thickness ".

J. Meng.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212046 .

Algorithms and Applications 
(special issue for GD'03) 9 (1): 31–52, 2005 .
 
We describe a new method of
 drawing graphs , based on allowing the edges to
be merged together and drawn as "tracks" (similar to train tracks).
We present heuristics for finding such drawings
based on my previous  algorithms
for finding maximal bipartite subgraphs , prove that several
important families of graphs have confluent drawings, and provide
examples of other graphs that can not be drawn in this way.

    Tiling space and slabs with acute tetrahedra . 
D. Eppstein,
 J. M. Sullivan ,
and  A. Üngör .  arXiv:cs.CG/0302027 .  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  27 (3): 237–255, 2004 .
 
We show it is possible to
 triangulate  three-dimensional space using only
tetrahedra with acute dihedral angles. We present several constructions
to achieve this, including one in which all dihedral angles are less
than 77.08 degrees, and another which tiles a slab in space.

a lazy deletion mechanism, and show in experiments that the results are
an improvement on the unmodified structures.

    Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0304018 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006 .
 
We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 
  
The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

    Quasiconvex programming . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at DIMACS Worksh. on Geometric Optimization, New Brunswick,
NJ, 2003. 
Plenary talk at  ALGO 2004 ,
Bergen, Norway, 2004.  arXiv:cs.CG/0412046 .  Combinatorial and Computational Geometry , Goodman, Pach, and
Welzl, eds., MSRI Publications 52, 2005, pp. 287–331.
 
Defines  quasiconvex programming , a form of generalized linear
programming in which one seeks the point minimizing the pointwise
maximum of a collection of quasiconvex functions.
Surveys algorithms for solving quasiconvex programs either numerically
or via generalizations of the dual simplex method from linear
programming, and describe varied applications of this geometric
optimization technique in meshing, scientific computation, information
visualization, automated algorithm analysis, and robust statistics.

    Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0307023 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

We describe an efficient streaming-model construction of epsilon-nets
and epsilon-approximations, and use it to find deterministic streaming-model
approximation algorithms for iceberg range queries and for various
robust statistics problems.

We describe a new algorithm, based on
 graph matching ,
for subdividing a
 triangle mesh  (without boundary)
so that it has a
 Hamiltonian cycle  of triangles, and prove that
this subdivision process increases the total number of triangles
in the mesh by at most a factor of 3/2.  We also prove lower bounds
on the increase needed for meshes with and without boundary.

Computing Systems  39 (6): 903–928, 2006 .
 
Studies the resilience of distributed computation networks against
adversarial and random fault models; shows that, in both models,
certain networks can withstand constant fault probabilities and
still contain a large subnetwork with similar expansion to the original.
  
    The lattice dimension of a graph.

Describes a polynomial time algorithm for isometrically embedding graphs
into an integer lattice of the smallest
possible dimension.  The technique involves
 maximum matching 
in an auxiliary graph derived from a
 partial cube  representation of the input.

    Algorithms for drawing media.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0406020 .  12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , New York, 2004. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3383, 2004, pp. 173–183.
 
We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
 partial cubes :
one based on
 finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph  and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.
  
Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book  Media Theory , making journal publication moot.

    All maximal independent sets and dynamic dominance for sparse
graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0407036 .  16th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Vancouver, 2005, pp. 451–459.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(4):A38, 2009 .
 
We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets
in bounded-degree graphs in constant time per set, in graphs from minor
closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

    Minimum dilation stars.  
D. Eppstein and
 K. Wortman .  arXiv:cs.CG/0412025 .  21st ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Pisa, 2005, pp. 321–326.   Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  37 (1): 27–37, 2007 .
 
We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2 α(n)  log 2 n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
 quasiconvex programming , and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

    Comment on "Location-Scale Depth".  
D. Eppstein.   J. Amer. Stat. Assoc.  99 (468): 976–979, 2004 .
 
Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional  hyperbolic
space .  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.
