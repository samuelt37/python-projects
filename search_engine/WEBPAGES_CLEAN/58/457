         I'm a  Ph.D. candidate</strong> in Network Systems at the 
Donald Bren School of Information and 
Computer Science,  University of California Irvine , working with Prof. 
 Nalini
Venkatasubramanian  in  
Distributed System Middleware(DSM)  group.    I received my 
 Bachelor's degree</strong> from the School of 
Telecommunication Engineering at  
Beijing Univerisity of Posts and Telecommunications , China, and my 
 Master's degree</strong> from the department of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineering at  
Imperial College London , United Kingdom.

         I'm now working on the
 Societal 
&amp; Geographical Notification and Alerting (SIGNAL)  project, and 
interested in researches in the following areas:  
	 Content dissemination with distributed and P2P systems, publish/subscribe 
	notification systems  
   
     Online social networks and crowdsourcing 
   
   
     Cloud services and applications 
   
 
	 Wireless and mobile systems, delay tolerant 
	networks (DTNs)

       Next Generation Community Notification and Alerting   the information needs of people are usually goegraphical correlated as well as socially correlated: (a) people are
often interested in events and information within their immediate
vicinity, and (b) people are often interested in events and information
of others who are socially related to them. In this project we explore
techniques to enable efficient and scalable community notifications by exploring knowledge of users'  geo-social contexts they exposed through online social networks and personal devices and knowledge of physical network environments and communication channels. We study and develop approaches in two conceptual layers: (a) content-layer foucsing on providing personalized information and contents
to users and (b) delivery-layer focusing on improving content delivery performance by considering different channels and devices (e.g., mobile networks and DTNs) the users connect to the
system with.
