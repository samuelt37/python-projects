	    About Me 
 I am a recent Ph.D. graduate (Fall 2014) from University of California, Irvine.  My adviser at UCI was  Padhraic Smyth  from the  UCI Datalab  research group, a group whose research interests involve probabilistic modeling and analysis of datasets.  I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics at California State University San Bernardino in 2009, and my M.S. degree in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine in 2011.
