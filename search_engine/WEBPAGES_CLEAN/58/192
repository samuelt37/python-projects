Confluent Orthogonal Drawings of Syntax Diagrams
 
 
Michael J. Bannister
 

 
We provide a framework for generating syntax diagrams (also
called railroad diagrams) for context-free grammars. Syntax diagrams
are a graphical representation of a context-free grammar, similar to how
a drawing of an NFA is a graphical representation of a regular gram-
mar. The typical style used when drawing syntax diagrams is based on
confluent orthogonal drawing. We provide several heuristic to optimize
the drawings of the syntax diagrams produced within our framework.
