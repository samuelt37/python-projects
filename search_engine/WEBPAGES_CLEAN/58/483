  papers we have discussed to date, but including at least one from the �Work
  in Context� lectures. You may include other references (web sites or external
  papers as you desire).  And you will

    Assignment 6 Due
  (Models/Theory) �  Choosing a theoretical or analytic framework to match a
  problem situation is critical but many of the papers we have read provide
  both frameworks and some example applications. Focusing on the papers from
  Weeks 1, 8, and 9, identify what were the critical characteristics of the
  authors� analyses / theoretical frameworks and in your own words, what sorts
  of applications these analyses and frameworks apply to best.
