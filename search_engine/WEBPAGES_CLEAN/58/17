  Convex Hulls 
     Castalia  and
 Deimos .
Philip Stook at U. Western Ontario
mentions an application of 3d convex hulls in mapping the surfaces
of these two asteroids.
 
    Convex hull,
Voronoi diagram, and Delaunay triangulation software 
from  
Nina Amenta's CG software directory .
 
    Convex hulls and interpolation .  Ken Clarkson describes some implementation
details of algorithms for convex hulls, alpha shapes, Voronoi diagrams,
and natural
neighbor interpolation.
 
    Image
Processing and Pattern Recognition in Soil Structure .  D. Luo of
Glasgow uses convex hulls and other geometric techniques to analyze
images of soil particles.
 
    Pneumonea
and tuberculosis diagnosis .  Jason Everhart of Los
Alamos uses convex hulls as part of a heuristic for estimating the
percentage of lung volume occupied by a pneumonea infection.
This initial guess of the lung contour is then iteratively refined
to a more accurate representation.
 
    US
Patent 4704694  uses convex hulls to recognize objects from video images.
 
    US
Patent 5086482  seems to cover gift-wrapping methods of computing convex hulls in bitmap images.
 
    US
Patent 5159645  performs character recognition by using convex hulls
to find the counters in each character. A similar idea also occurs in 
 Patent
4817166 .
 
   US Patents
 5317681  and
 5428717  cover methods for finding convex hulls of
polyhedra based on flipping reflex edges, along with an animated version
of this procedure that creates a smooth morph of the polyhedron to its hull.
 
    US
Patent 5463721  describes the use of convex hulls in a method for finding a
path for a radiation-beam scanner so it can get enough data
to reconstruct object shapes. Patents
 4888693 ,
 4969110 ,
and
 5053958 
also use convex hulls for computerized tomography.
 
    US
Patent 5465221  describes a part inspection system including the use
of convex hulls to determine stable orientations.
 
    US
Patent 5483606  describes a method of registering (lining up) copied
pages with each other in a copying machine, using the convex hulls of
images of the pages.
