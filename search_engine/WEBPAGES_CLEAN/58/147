  Lubomir  Bic</strong>  Professor</strong>  DEGREE: Ph.D. 1979, UC Irvine  RESEARCH AREAS:  Networks and Distributed Systems  RESEARCH INTERESTS:  Dr. Bic's current project, called Messengers, focuses on developing a new programming paradigm for distributed systems based on the principle of autonomous messages. A Messenger carries its own behavior as it propagates through a network of interpreter nodes. At each node, a Messenger can perform arbitrary computations, hence the collection of Messengers comprising an application may be viewed as a coordination layer, which triggers the execution of node-resident programs and carries data.
