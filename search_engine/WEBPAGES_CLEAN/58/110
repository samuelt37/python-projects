class OEAbsoluteConfTest : public OEConfTest
    
This implementation of OEConfTest combines subsequent connection tables
into a multi-conformer molecule if they:

   Have the same title (optional)
 
 Have the same number of atoms and bonds in the same order
 
 Each atom and bond must have identical properties with its order
correspondent in the subsequent connection table
 
  
This conformer test sets all fully specified isomeric values to UNDEFINED.

  
    
OEAbsoluteConfTest(bool compTitles = true)
    
The constructor for OEAbsoluteConfTest has a default argument for whether
or not to compare titles.  If the constructor is called with no arguments
or with the argument true, the titles will be required to be the same.
Otherwise, the titles will not be compared.  In the latter instance, each
conformer will have the individual title of its original connection table
and the multi-conformer molecule will reflect the title of the active
conformer.
