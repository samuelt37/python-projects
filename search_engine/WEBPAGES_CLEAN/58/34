    An object has state, behavior, and identity  A class is a set of objects that share common structure (I.e., attributes) and common behavior (I.e., operations)  Every object is created as an instance of some class  Its class �affiliation� does not change during its lifetime  At any time, a class has zero or more instances    Classes are usually static  Their existence, semantics, and relationships are defined before program execution    Objects are dynamic  They can be created and destroyed during program execution    Hiding the implementation details of an object is called information hiding or encapsulation
