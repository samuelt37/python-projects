virtual OEAtomBase *GetBgn() const
    
Return the ``begin'' (or ``source'') atom of a bond.  The begin atom of a
bond is defined either when the bond is created with
 OEMolBase::NewBond , or possibly by a call to the
 OEBondBase::SetBgn  method.  If the begin atom was specified as the
NULL pointer,  (OEAtomBase*)0 , when the bond was created, this
method may return a NULL pointer.
