 ICS Minors 

 
 

 A minor is an established set of courses which together take a student beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or discipline. They are a way to pursue a focused study in an additional subject that complements your major, career goals, or is an area of personal interest. 
 A minor in the computer science field, for instance, can help prepare students for a profession, career, or academic pursuit in which computer science is an integral part but is not the primary focus.

        »</strong>  Adding/Declaring a Minor</strong> 
 Most minors, including all minors within Bren ICS, do not need to be officially declared. However, a few minors at UCI do have specific declaration procedures. Students should speak with a counselor or peer advisor in the School of their intended minor to clarify any questions about the process and requirements. 
 Some major/minor combinations are not allowed. This applies to some ICS programs, and is outlined in this  Majors and Minors Restriction Chart . 
 To have the minor added to your degree audit, notify your academic counselor in the School of your major. To officially receive a minor, you must successfully pass all the requirements and you must list it on your Application for Graduation. 
 Important details to note: 
  Pass/Not Pass and Minor Requirements  
 
  No more than two courses may be taken P/NP and applied to any minor on campus.
