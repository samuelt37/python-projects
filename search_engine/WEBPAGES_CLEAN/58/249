        I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine.   Padhraic Smyth  is my advisor.  My research interests reside in both the theory and application of Bayesian latent variable models, including neural networks.  I've done research internships at Amazon, Microsoft Research / Bing, and Twitter Cortex.  I graduated from  Lehigh University  (Bethlehem, PA) where I worked with  Henry Baird .
