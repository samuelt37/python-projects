  Yaming  Yu</strong>  Associate Professor</strong>  DEGREE: Ph.D. 2005, Harvard University  RESEARCH AREAS:  Statistics and Statistical Theory  RESEARCH INTERESTS:  Dr. Yu's research interests include (a) Bayesian modeling, e.g., as applied to astrophysical data obtained by today's high resolution telescopes; (b) missing data problems, e.g., multiple imputation of public-use databases by iteratively fitting conditional models based on monotone missing data patterns; (c) statistical computing, e.g., numerical analysis tools to accelerate the EM algorithm, and efficient data augmentation schemes to speed up Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.
