 Do you find yourself using a complex word processor or
spreadsheet to keep track of small tables of text, such as: 

  Lists of books or DVDs you own or wish to get? 

 Account names for the different web sites you visit? 

 Long-running computations on multiple computers and their
results? 

 Wine tasting notes? 
  If so, Tabulizer may be for you.
Tabulizer provides an easy-to-use interface for editing and
displaying tables.  To make a new
row, simply press the return key, and start typing, using the tab key to
move from cell to cell. You can also edit
existing rows, sort the rows, rearrange columns, copy and paste, and
perform many
other operations, as described in  Tabulizer's
online help file . 
 
      
    
  
 

 Tabulizer is freeware, distributed with full source code.
