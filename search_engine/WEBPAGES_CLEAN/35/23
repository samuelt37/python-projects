 Computer Law Seminar Readings<body>

 Computer Law Seminar Readings
 
 This list will grow as the quarter progresses.
Many of these materials were written for lawyers, which means
they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring
them to class so I can (try to) clarify them.
 
 
I have made the non-Web references
listed below available in the grad course materials file
(the upper left drawer in the filing cabinet outside the ICS kitchen).
 
There won't be as many readings on other topics as there are on 
intellectual property;
there's more settled computer law in IP than in most other areas.
