    Term Topics from
  Winter 2002    
         
    These project titles
  and abstracts from the Winter Quarter 2002 offering of this class are for
  motivation only. The class focus is more theoretical so this quarter�s term
  projects should reflect that at least in their presentation and discussion of
  a theme.     
       
    Wearable
  Technologies and their Social Impacts    
   People are becoming increasingly dependent on computers,
  yet they often lack access to their machines. Wearable computers solve this
  accessibility problem by following their users wherever they may go. As
  technology improves more of these  wearables  are
  being incorporated into modern societies. This paper discusses advantages and
  disadvantages of  wearables . Also, the social
  impacts of some of today�s wearable are presented as well 
    as  a brief look into the future
  of wearable computers. 
       
    Real-time
  Interactive Applications in Ubiquitous Computing    
   This paper will introduce some of the issues that is
  involved in a particular area of ubiquitous computing, which is real-time
  interactive applications. �  These are
  applications hat allows one to interact with multiple people in a real-time
  manner. �  Furthermore, any one of the
  participant should have the ability to change the global state at any
  moment. �  First we will discuss some of
  the requirements that are involved in these kinds of applications,  then  we will look at some of the applications that is
  currently being developed. �  Finally, we
  will examine the proposed architecture for real-time interactive  applications( RIA) and some of the interesting challenges
  that are present within these architectures. 
       
    Ubiquitous
  Computing: �  The Past, the Present and
  the Future    
   This paper is a brief survey the existing field of
  ubiquitous computing. �  It touches on
  the high level detail on research fields that are closely related to
  ubiquitous computing. �  This paper
  begins with an investigation of the origin of ubiquitous computing �  ubicomp  (the past). �
   Then it discusses the efforts in computer research across multiple
  disciplines (the present). �  Next the paper
  presents a brief discussion of the challenges in ubiquitous computing (a
  bridge to the future). �  At last a
  summary of the key aspects is given in the conclusion section. 
       
    Ubiquitous
  Computing: Are Agents the Future?     
   Intelligent agents for long have been proposed as the
  future of computing. In many computing scenarios we have intelligent agents
  playing important roles and trying to ease peoples� life. This paper looks at
  ubiquitous computing � proposed as one the futures of computing and how
  intelligent agents fit the scenario or if they do. The approach taken is the
  study of various different types of agents and then relating it to the ideal
  scenarios in ubiquitous computing as stated by the father of ubiquitous
  computing, Mark  Weiser . 
       
    User Modeling and
  Ubiquitous Computers    
   Ubiquitous Computing is a paradigm in which lightweight
  computers are incorporated into everyday things and accomplish tasks with
  minimal explicit human interaction. The possibilities of ubiquitous computing
  has gained a lot of interest for a wide range of disciplines, and is the
  focus of a major initiative in Europe where the European Union has charged
  its Commission on Future and Emerging Technologies with the task of making
  ubiquitous computing a reality in the near future. The goal of ubiquitous
  computing is to become �ready-to-hand,� or to be an invisible medium for the
  user�s intent. While many ubiquitous computers will never interact with the
  user directly, they all will in one way or another carry out the user�s
  wishes. To do so effectively, these devices must have some idea of what the
  user needs; they must have some form of user model that they can use to
  predict the user�s desire. 
       
    Technical aspects
  of realizing a vision of ubiquitous computing    
   Ubiquitous computing often gives visions of how they
  expect the device or the environment the user is in to behave. The paper
  focuses on the needs for today�s  consumers ,  being
  easily accessible everywhere, easy to use, low maintenance , portable and
  very convenient. Most of the �visions� that exist often fail to conceive the
  backbone infrastructure and architecture that they expect the applications to
  run on. The paper walks through a vision of ubiquitous computing and deals
  with the technical aspects that constrain the efficient realization of
  Ubiquitous computing. The paper also gives solutions to what could be the
  efficient backbone structure for ubiquitous computing. 
       
    Ubiquity and
  Business: INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF UBIQUITOUS IT SOLUTIONS IN BUSINESS MODELS    
   This paper discusses the state of art in implementing
  pervasive computing solutions in the finance industry, the issues involved,
  and varied approaches. It then discusses the  EasyWinWin 
  requirements gathering model, discussing its features and applicability to
  projects involving cutting edge technology. It then proposes the additional
  issues that need to be discussed in  WinWin 
  negotiations when it is applied to implementing pervasive solutions in the
  finance industry 
       
    WEARABLE COMPUTING
  �What Lies Ahead?    
   This project aims to discuss the distinction between
  ubiquitous and wearable computing; the status of wearable computers; the
  challenges faced by software and hardware manufacturers in developing
  effective and widely accepted wearable devices; and the commencement of a new
  paradigm for how wearable technology can create value for consumers and
  enterprises. 
       
    Survey of Biometric
  Authentication System    
   Based on the survey, many companies will still use
  traditional security solutions, but the market of biometric authentication is
  getting its ground step by step. After September 11, security issue concerns
  more and more people. In fact, for many organizations, implementing the right
  biometric user identification technique can improve data security and lead to
  significant cost savings by reducing help desk calls. As long as the
  biometric technology become  maturer  and the cost
  will become less, we will see more applications will biometric
  authentications appear in our life. 
       
    Augmented Reality:
  A Brief Survey and its Relation to Ubiquitous Computing    
   Augmented reality is the term applied to systems that seek
  to combine a physical view of the world with digital information. �  This additional data is superimposed on
  this physical view, with the intent of enhancing the performance of human
  beings in the world due to the additional information now available. �  Augmented reality has found application in
  many domain areas ranging from military training purposes to entertainment,
  and initial systems have shown great promise.  � However, the technology is not without its
  problems; important issues that need to be solved include the density of data
  displayed, the accurate alignment of images, and the exact tracking of
  physical locations of objects. �
   Augmented reality technologies have the potential to change the way
  people live their lives with information readily available to them; this
  matches the goals of research in ubiquitous computing. �  An examination of the principles and
  practical considerations of ubiquitous computing technologies reveals that
  augmented reality could very well be the ideal technological implementation
  of  Weiser's  ubiquitous vision. 
       
    HUMAN
  COMPUTERIZATION: THE CYBORG    
   In addition to smart rooms and mobile Internet access
  Ubiquitous computing circles need to accept the imminent usefulness and need
  for human computerization. By placing computational devices within a
  biological entity, in most cases a human, one vision of ubiquitous computing
  is realized. Popularized as a feature of science fiction literature, the
  concept has grown into a scientific reality with tremendous market potential.
   Cyborg  technology is truly an invisible
  ready-at-hand computer system available everywhere a person could venture. 
       
    Challenges Faced in
  a Nomadic Computing Environment    
   The number of people accessing their computing resources
  away from the desktop and while in motion has soared over the past few years.
  People now wish to have access to their information and resources anytime and
  anywhere. Advances in the field of networking and the advent of smaller
  computing and communicating devices have served to assist this trend further.
  All this has heralded the 'nomadic computing' era in which users can wander
  from one location to another and have instant access to their personal
  information, in an environment that closely mimics their personal preferences
  and settings. This nomadic era, however, faces a number of challenges with
  respect to performance, reliability, speed, security and consistency. The
  current state of nomadic computing resources, devices and networks is not
  advanced enough to provide the nomad with services comparable to their
  desktop counterparts. This paper is an attempt to survey the state of art in
  nomadic computing environments and to identify some of the challenges faced
  by nomads. 
       
    Context Aware
  Applications    
   Ubiquitous Computing aims to make the computer� invisible�
  to the user and enhance the level of services offered to him. Computers are
  not intelligent enough to make use to context information while interacting
  with users or other computing devices. Such context information could be used
  by applications to make interactions flexible, adaptable and user-friendly
  for the user. This term paper talks about such context-aware applications. It
  discusses the framework required for such applications and provides
  descriptions about the various existing context-aware applications. It takes
  a special look at such applications in mobile computing domain.
