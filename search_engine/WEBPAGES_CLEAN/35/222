Minimum Dilation Stars 
David Eppstein and Kevin Wortman
 
The dilation of a Euclidean graph is defined as the ratio of distance
in the graph divided by distance in  R d  .  We consider
the problem of positioning the root of a star such that the dilation
of the resulting graph is minimal.  We present a deterministic
 O ( n  log  n )-time solution
to the decision problem, as well as a randomized
 O ( n  log  n )
expected-time solution to the optimization problem.
 
The talk will cover selected results from a paper currently under 
preparation.
