 Improving Bound Propagation 

 Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
This paper extends previously proposed bound propagation
algorithm [11] for computing lower and upper bounds on
posterior marginals in Bayesian networks. We improve the bound
propagation scheme by taking advantage of the directionality in
Bayesian networks and applying the notion of relevant subnetwork.
We also propose an approximation scheme for the linear optimization
subproblems. We demonstrate empirically that while the resulting
bounds loose some precision, we achieve 10-100 times speedup
compared to original bound propagation using a simplex solver.
