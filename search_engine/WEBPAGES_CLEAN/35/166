  (  kay@uci.edu )  Rich Pattis  
  (  pattis@ics.uci.edu )
 

  
  Course Goals and Plans 
The three main goals of ICS 90 are to help new students make a successful 
transition to UCI, to build a sense of community in ICS, and to introduce  
new undergrads to the school, some of the faculty, the majors we offer, 
and the work we do.
 
In a typical class session, two faculty members will speak for half an hour 
each, about their work and background; David and Rich will then also spend 
a half hour addressing more general issues about college life, the field of 
computing, and strategies for success in ICS.


  
  Student Expectations 

ICS 90 is a one-unit course graded Pass/Not Pass. We have designed it  
not to require work outside of the class meetings, but we do expect every 
student to attend every class. If you cannot attend a class for any reason, 
send an email explanation to
 Rich Pattis 
as soon as possible. 
  It's in class where the learning happens, so you should be present. Before 
the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we 
will record attendance electronically.
  
For issues that come up between class meetings, we have set up a forum at 
piazza.com.
 Sign yourself up  and then
 participate  by posting
questions or 
supplying answers. We may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class 
for polls and surveys.
  You may bring your phone, tablet, or laptop for attendance-taking and for 
using Piazza, but do not use it for other purposes, unless asked by the speaker. 
After you check in, please turn off your devices and put them away.
  

  Seating: Two Classrooms
 
ICS 90 meets in two rooms at the same time:  BS3 1200 and HSLH 100A. 
You are officially enrolled in one section or the other, but  ignore which 
room you're enrolled in  and instead attend in the following room:
 
* If your class level is  FR  or  SO , come to BS3 1200. 
* If your class level is  JR  or  SR , come to HSLH 100A.
  
This is your official "class level" as shown on WebReg at UCI.
  
Most weeks, one faculty member will speak starting at 5:00pm and another 
will speak starting at 5:30pm. All students are required to be present for 
these talks. The third half-hour of each week's class will be devoted to 
broader information about college-level work and ICS. This material 
is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class 
level is  FR  or  SO . We will have these discussions in BS3 1200 only. 
Upper division students (from HSLH 100A) are welcome to attend this 
third half-hour (the room is just three minutes away), but they may also 
choose to skip it.
  

  Recording Attendance
 
Bring a phone, tablet, laptop, smart device to class that allows web browsing.
 
During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to the ICS-90 Checkin page 
and record that you are attending class by following the Checkin link at the 
top of this web page. There you will see a message with instructions about 
how to continue. There, You will enter a special word that we will announce 
in class. On some days there might be multiple checking words.
  
It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this App and then leave 
class early, unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission 
beforehand with Rich Pattis. Likewise, you cannot check in for other 
students, but you may allow present students to use your device to run 
the App.
