3.1.13 GetIdx 
 
   
virtual unsigned int GetIdx() const
    
Return the atom index of an atom.  This value is assigned by OEChem
when an atom is created.  The atom index is unique for the atoms of a
given molecule, and is stable (not reused) for the lifetime of that
 OEMolBase .  These values may not be assigned sequentially, and
may contain gaps.  Atom indices are guaranteed to be less than
 OEMolBase::GetMaxAtomIdx .  Atom indices are typically only used
for efficiently storing data in arrays (or vectors) externally to the
 OEMolBase .  They arrays can be conveniently indexed via
 OEAtomBase::GetIdx() .  For iterating across the atoms of a
molecule, use  OEMolBase::GetAtoms()  and for keeping track of a
particular atom use an  OEAtomBase* .
