    Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 96-15 , ICS, UCI, 1996.  arXiv:cs.CG/9907031 .  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  23: 43–52, 2002 .
 
Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for  empirical
network analysis  and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n c ), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

    Algorithms for coloring quadtrees .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and
B. Hutchings.  arXiv:cs.CG/9907030 .  Algorithmica  32 (1): 87–94, 2002.
 
We consider several variations of the problem of
 coloring  the squares of a
 quadtree  so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

    Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/9912013 .  
 16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  28 (1): 1–17, 2002.
 
We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".

    Searching for spaceships . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.AI/0004003 . 
MSRI Combinatorial Game Theory Research Worksh., July 2000.  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 433–453 .
 
We describe software that searches for
 spaceships in Conway's Game of
Life and related two-dimensional cellular automata .
Our program searches through a state space
related to the de Bruijn graph of the automaton,
using a method that combines features of breadth first and
iterative deepening search, and includes fast
bit-parallel  graph reachability 
and  path enumeration  algorithms
for finding the successors of each state.
Successful results include a
 new 2c/7
spaceship in Life , found by searching a space with 2^126 states.

    One-dimensional peg solitaire, and duotaire .  C. Moore 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0006067  and
 math.CO/0008172 . 
MSRI Combinatorial Game Theory Research Worksh., July 2000.  Santa Fe Inst. working paper 00-09-050 , September 2000.  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 341–350 .
 
We describe by a regular expression the one-dimensional peg-solitaire
positions reducible to a single peg, and provide a linear-time algorithm
(based on finding  shortest paths  in an
associated DAG) for
reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg
solitaire moves in an attempt to be the one to move last.

    Phutball endgames are hard .  E. Demaine ,
 M. Demaine ,
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CC/0008025 .  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 351–360 .
 
We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's
Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the
current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In
contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.  Engineering with Computers  18 (3): 173–187, 2002.
 
We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.
  
Note that the Meshing Roundtable version was by Bern and Eppstein.
Erickson was added as a co-author during the revisions for the journal version.

    The minimum expectation selection problem . 
D. Eppstein and
 G. Lueker . 
10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.  arXiv:cs.DS/0110011 .  
 Random Structures and Algorithms  21: 278–292, 2002 .
 
We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

    A steady state model for graph power laws . 
D. Eppstein and
 J. Wang .  2nd Int.
Worksh. Web Dynamics , Honolulu, 2002.  arXiv:cs.DM/0204001 .
 
We propose a random graph model that (empirically) appears to have a
power law degree distribution.  Unlike previous models, our model is
based on a Markov process rather than incremental growth.  We compare
our model with others in its ability to predict web graph clustering
behavior.

    Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres . 
D. Eppstein,
 G. Kuperberg ,
and
 G. Ziegler .  arXiv:math.CO/0204007 .  Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday ,
Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.
 
We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Separating thickness from geometric thickness .

10th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Irvine, 2002. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  2528, 2002, pp. 150–161. 
In  Towards a Theory of Geometric Graphs , AMS, 2004, Contemporary
Math 342, J. Pach, ed., pp. 75–86.
 
We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments
similar to those in
" Separating book thickness from thickness ".

    Algorithms for media .

 J.-C.
Falmagne .  arXiv:cs.DS/0206033 .  Int.
Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis , Irvine, 2003.   Discrete Applied Mathematics  156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008 .
 
Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
 medium , a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

    Dynamic generators of topologically embedded graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0207082 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 599–608 .
 
We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

    Reference caching using unit distance redundant codes for
activity reduction on address buses . 
D. Eppstein and
 T. Givargis .  Worksh. Embedded System
Codesign (ESCODES'02) , San Jose, 2002, pp. 43–48.   J. Microprocessors &amp; Microsystems  29 (4): 145–153, 2005. 
 
We study the problem of minimizing transitions in address signals
on a bus.  The UDRC part of the title refers to an algorithm for coding
signals with at most one transition per signal (using an increased number of
wires); we combine this with a scheme for caching previously coded addresses
and use trace data to compare our technique with previous approaches.

    Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212007 .  
 19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281 .
 
We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

Algorithms and Applications 
(special issue for GD'03) 9 (1): 31–52, 2005 .
 
We describe a new method of
 drawing graphs , based on allowing the edges to
be merged together and drawn as "tracks" (similar to train tracks).
We present heuristics for finding such drawings
based on my previous  algorithms
for finding maximal bipartite subgraphs , prove that several
important families of graphs have confluent drawings, and provide
examples of other graphs that can not be drawn in this way.
