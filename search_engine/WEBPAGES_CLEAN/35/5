  Approach  
      Explore multi-version hardware synthesis
 
  low-overhead hardware for validation
  high-overhead hardware for validation
       Invariants
 
  Explore automatic derivation of invariants
  Exploit hardware invariant annotations for test
  (still need automatic synthesis for dynamic adaptation)
