8.4.8 Valence 
 

 
Valence flag.  When set, the values returned by the
OEAtomBase::GetValence method of the query atom and potential graph
match will be tested for equivalence.  The OEAtomBase::GetValence
method includes the valence contribution from implicit hydrogens,
therefore, the expression test may return successfully even when the
explicit valence of two corresponding atoms differ.
