  1. Section Headings 
   You can create headings by starting and ending a line with up to five equal signs. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.       Headings can be automatically numbered, you can enable or disable this for each page (see  #pragmaÂ section-numbers  on  HelpOnProcessingInstructions ) and for the whole site (see  show_section_numbers  on  HelpOnConfiguration ).       For more information on the possible markup, see  HelpOnEditing .            Headings may not contain wiki markup.         You cannot indent headings.         
  1.1. Example 
                   = Heading =
  == Subheading ==
  === Level 3 ===
  ==== Level 4 ====
  ===== Level 5 =====

     Note that proper section numbering requires you to order sections according to a valid structure, i.e. correctly nested. Our sample doesn't do this, so you get a different numbering scheme than you might expect.       
  4. section-numbers 
     Switches automatic numbering of section headers.           #pragma section-numbers off    off or 0 disable numbering, on or 1 enables numbering. The default mode is set by the show_section_numbers config option.       When enabling numbering, its possible to use specific heading level:           #pragma section-numbers 2    Only displays section numbers for headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6).
