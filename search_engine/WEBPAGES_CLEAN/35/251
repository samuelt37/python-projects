       This page lets you customize your personal settings for this site.
      These settings are stored on the server and are identified by a session
      key stored in a browser cookie. That cookie allows your settings to be
      restored on subsequent visits.

       Session key:
         
       The session key is used to identify stored custom
      settings and session data on the server. Although it is
      automatically generated by default, you may change it to something
      easier to remember at any time if you wish to load your settings
      in a different web browser. 
     
       
       Restore session:
         
       You may load a previously created session by entering the
      corresponding session key below. This lets you share settings between
      multiple computers and web browsers.
