The Parity of the Number of Spanning Trees in a Graph  David Eppstein , ICS, UC Irvine 

Every bipartite Eulerian graph has an even number of spanning
trees. More generally, a graph has evenly many spanning trees if
and only if it has an Eulerian edge cut, and if B is any edge cut
in a graph G, the gcd of vertex degrees in B divides the number of
spanning trees of G. The proofs of these facts are based on a new
algebraic characterization of the number of spanning trees of G,
due to  
Bacher, de la Harpe, and Nagnibeda .
