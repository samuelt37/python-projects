    UC IRVINE - ICS 125 PROJECT IN SYSTEM DESIGN 
     PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
     
      

Recent trends in computing have made its way into hand held, wireless
devices.  These exciting new devices present new opportunities in the
area of software engineering.  The same applications that use to reside
on desktops can now reside on portable and ubiquitous devices.  However,
their size and limited resources can make it difficult to implement
certain applications.

You will be designing a email client and server that will work over a
(simulated) wireless phone.  Since email is primarily used on desktop
machines, you will need to specify and design a new email interface
which will work effectively in this new mobile environment.  

A Nokia WAP server and toolkit will provide you with both the server and
client on a Windows NT workstation.  Java will be used to integrate and
implement the services above.
