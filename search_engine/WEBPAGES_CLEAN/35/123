				 Four SDCL members visited Lincoln, NE for the SCALE meeting, joining collaborators at Carnegie Mellon and UNL in the cornfields. SDCL presented work on several ongoing projects including crowdsourced programming, tagging code, and triaging bugs. Andre gave a talk surveying the past, present, and future of SDCL. And we discussed ways of further involving industry partners in our work.
