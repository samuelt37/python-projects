  C OURSE  S CHEDULE
AND  I NFORMATION    
 
  Instructor:    David G. Kay ,
406B Computer Science.  Stop by any time, or send electronic mail to "   kay   ".  
 
  Meeting time and place:   Wednesdays
2:00 to 4:50 p.m., in room 101 ICF.  Since this is a two-unit
course, we may adjust the times slightly or skip the occasional class meeting.  
 
  Course goals:   In this course we will
cover teaching computer science at the college level, from the instructor's
perspective.  This perspective is useful even for students, as consumers
of instruction, but we presume that participants in this course have some
(perhaps tentative) plans to teach computer science, whether through University
Extension, Summer Sessions, or their own academic job.  We will look at
(and in most cases practice) designing and running one's own course,
designing assignments and exams, setting grades, preparing teaching portfolios
(records of your teaching for use in job applications and promotion cases),
making curricular decisions, and other related issues.  
 
  Course requirements:   This seminar
is not designed to impose a large time burden on the participants beyond
the class meetings themselves.  Grading is satisfactory/unsatisfactory or
pass/not-pass.  But it is important that you attend the class meetings,
participate in the discussions, and prepare for the various activities,
which will include some readings and a variety of informal presentations
leading towards your own complete design of a course.
