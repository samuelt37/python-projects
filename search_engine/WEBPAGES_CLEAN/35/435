Halving lines and k-sets
 
   Sets of points with many halving lines . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-86 , ICS, UCI, 1992.
 
I used genetic algorithms to search for small configurations of points
bisected by lines in many combinatorially distinct ways.

    Improved bounds for intersecting triangles and halving planes . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 91-60 , ICS, UCI, 1991.  J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A  62: 176–182, 1993.
 
Reduces the polylogarithmic term in an upper bound for
the three-dimensional  k -set problem.
  
A bug in the proof was  corrected by Nivasch and Sharir .

    Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-11 , ICS, UCI, 1995.   27th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing,  Las Vegas, 1995, pp. 662–671 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  20: 463–476, 1998 .
 
Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.

    Choosing subsets with maximum weighted average . 
D. Eppstein and 
 
D. S. Hirschberg .  Tech. Rep. 95-12, ICS, UCI, 1995 .  
 5th MSI Worksh. on Computational Geometry , 1995, pp. 7–8 .   J. Algorithms  24: 177–193, 1997 .
 
Uses geometric optimization techniques to find, among  n  weighted values,
the  k  to drop so as to maximize the weighted average of the remaining values.
The feasibility test for the corresponding decision problem involves
 k -sets in a dual line arrangement.
