 The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry Sejnowski, now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with Ning Qian of Johns-Hopkins University. 

   Data Set Information:  
 This is a data set used by Ning Qian and Terry Sejnowski in their study using a neural net to predict the secondary structure of certain globular proteins [1].  The idea is to take a linear sequence of amino acids and to predict, for each of these amino acids, what secondary structure it is a part of within the protein.  There are three choices: alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and random-coil.  The data set contains both a large set of training data and a distinct set of data that can be used for testing the resulting network.  Qian and Sejnowski use a Nettalk-like approach and report an accuracy of 64.3% on the test set, and they speculate that this is about the best that can be done using only local context.  There is also a domain theory in the folder, donated and created by Jude Shavlik &amp; Rich Maclin
