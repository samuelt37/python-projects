Non-Isomorphic Graph Generation 
Brad Hutchings, ICS, UC Irvine 

Time and space efficient non-isomorphic graph generation may have
applications in graph compression, generating graph catalogs, and
computationally looking at properties of sets of graphs.  Brendan McKay 's paper   
Isomorph-Free Exhaustive Generation   presents an abstract
framework that can be applied to many interesting graph and
non-graph generation problems. I will discuss two graph generation
problems, Maximal Planar Graphs and Triangle Free Graphs. I will
then explain how McKay's general method applies to graph problems
and compare with selected graph generation schemes.
