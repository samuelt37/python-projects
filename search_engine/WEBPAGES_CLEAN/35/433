  Review of current distributed web authoring systems and the

  Ron Fein on collaborative web authoring in Microsoft Word

  Henrik Frystyk on Amaya, PUT model

  Dave Long on GNNpress/GNNserver

  Andy Schulert on FrontPage

     Afternoon (1:30 PM) 

  Identification of key areas in which existing systems are
unable to interoperate

  Discussion of which key areas can be profitably addressed
by this working group, and a rough prioritization of the areas

  Solicitation of volunteers for coordinating work on improving
interoperability in key areas

  Development of criteria for evaluating the success of key
area work groups

  Establishing timelines for action

   Notes 

 
As sometimes happens, aggressive schedules slip.  In the case
of this meeting, Dave Long and Andy Schulert actually gave their
presentations after lunch.  This resulted in a more compressed
time for discussion.  The topic of the working group's purpose
and sponsorship was revisited in the afternoon session, immediately
after the talks.
