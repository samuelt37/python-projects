     Constraints
 
  Many useful constraints modeled in type system
  Some additional static analysis may be needed
  Research into expanded type systems with constraints
       Need representations where the abstraction is explicit.  
 
  You do not want to recover abstraction by analysis
  Abstractions come down from the top, not up from the bottom
       Leverage component technologies (CORBA, COM)
