 How DAV Differs from Normal HTTP<body>

  How DAV Differs from Normal HTTP  
      Request Vs. Action
 
  GET/PUT/DELETE - Cause a Result
  COPY/MOVE/DAV DELETE/LOCK/CHECK IN/OUT/ETC. - Request a Result
       Multiple Actions - One Request
 
     Client to Server Communication not Server to Server (How does one copy a resource anyway?)
