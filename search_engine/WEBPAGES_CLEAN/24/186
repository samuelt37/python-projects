 Exponential Algorithms: Homework 4<body>

  ICS 280, Fall 2000:
Exponential Algorithms  
Homework Assignment 4
 


 
Projects like  distributed.net ,
 SETI@Home ,
 Entropia ,
and  others ,
have attempted to apply the large number of computers available via the 
internet to perform massive computational tasks.  The model of computation 
is that a problem is broken up into tasks, and each computer in the project 
requests a task from a central coordinator.  When it finishes computing the 
task, it returns the results to the coordinator and requests a new task 
until the project is completed.  In order to keep network bandwidth to a 
minimum, the description and results of a task should be short, and each 
task should take a moderate amount of time (say an hour or a day). 

 Which of the exponential-algorithm paradigms we've seen in this course 
(e.g. generate-and-test, backtracking, dynamic programming, random-walk, 
and quantum computing) would be suitable for application in such a 
distributed system?  For each paradigm, explain how it could be partitioned 
into tasks or why it might be difficult to partition it into tasks.
