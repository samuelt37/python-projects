 Impact of Memory Stalls<body>

  Impact of Memory Stalls  
      A statically scheduled processor with a blocking cache stalls, on average, for
 
  15% of the time in integer benchmarks
  43% of the time in f.p. benchmarks
  70% of the time in transaction benchmark
       Possible performance improvements due to improved memory hierarchy without technology scaling:
 
  1.17x, 
  1.89x, and 
  3.33x 
       Possible improvements with technology scaling 
 
  2.4x, 7.5x, and 20x
