 Research 

 
Thomas A. Alspaugh's research focuses on
requirements methods and tools for
getting the right software solution
to the right human problem. 
Prominent themes within his work are
the interactions between law and requirements,
OSS licenses,  
privacy,
effective use of scenarios and narrative requirements,
bidirectional connection between
stakeholder requirements
and
later development phases,
empirical studies and requirements research,
and
how stakeholders understand requirements (or fail to).
