												Article: Power Failure: The Battered Legacy of Leaded Batteries, by Oladele A. Ogunseitan for Environmental Science &amp; Technology   
											 
											 
												 
													 
														
															 
														
														
														The history of automobiles is inextricable from the story of one of the most pervasive toxic chemical exposures in modern human history. Globally, billions of people1 were poisoned by lead (Pb) between 1921, when General Motors Corporation introduced tetraethyl lead as an antiknock agent in gasoline-powered cars, until 2015, when leaded gasoline was scheduled to be phased out in Algeria, the last country still using leaded gasoline.

												Webinar Series: Black Carbon - Featuring UCI Prof. Rufus Edwards   
											 
											 
												 
													 
														
															 
														
														
														Black carbon is the sooty material emitted from combustion processes, and it can affect human health and the climate. Its role in the atmosphere is broad and complex. In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) STAR program awarded ten grants to universities and organizations to address Black Carbon’s Role in Global to Local Scale Climate and Air Quality. Grantees focused on various black carbon research issues, such as better accounting for emissions and uncertainty, tracking how black carbon “ages” or reacts in the atmosphere, and better representing its ability to impact cloud droplet formation.? Highlights from the research findings will be summarized in this webinar series.
