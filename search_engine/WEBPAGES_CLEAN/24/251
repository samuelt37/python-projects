  February 11,  2016</strong>      Dean Stern to speak at AAAS symposium on stronger science behind forensics</strong>      
Dean  Hal Stern</strong>, professor of statistics at UCI and co-director of the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence ( CSAFE ) that is based at  Iowa State , is part of a panel of experts who will be discussing "Forensic Sciences: Toward a Stronger Scientific Framework" during the annual meeting of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science  on Feb. 14, 2016 in Washington, D.C. Stern will specifically be speaking about probability models to assess the value of evidence. He will be joined on the panel by Christophe Champod, a professor in the Institute of Police Science at the  University of Lausanne  in Switzerland; and Karen Kafadar, commonwealth professor and chair of statistics at the  University of Virginia  and a co-director of CSAFE. The National Institute of Standards and Technology established CSAFE last year with a five-year grant of up to $20 million. The center's primary goal is to build a statistically sound and scientifically solid foundation under two branches of forensics: pattern evidence (including fingerprints and bullet marks) and digital evidence (including data from cell phones and computers).
