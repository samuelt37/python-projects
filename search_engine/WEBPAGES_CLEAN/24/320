Packing Stretchable Bins  George Lueker , ICS, UC Irvine 

 We consider a variation of the bin packing problem in which a
fixed number of bins can be filled to a level exceeding 1. The goal
is to minimize the total cost of the bins used, where the cost of a
bin filled to level L is defined to be max(1,L). We discuss
approximation algorithms for this problem.
