 Thunderbird Setup for ICS Gmail 

 
 

  This tutorial is based on Thunderbird 24.3.0. If you're using a different version, the naming convention may differ, but the settings will remain the same.  
   
 This guide shows how to setup and access your ICS Gmail account via a web browser and/or Thunderbird. 
 Activating your ICS Gmail Account 
  If you have not changed your ICS password recently (since summer 2013), go to  My Account</strong> at  elnino.ics.uci.edu  to change it.  You may skip Steps 1 and 2 if you already completed them as illustrated  here .  
 Set your email forwarding to ICS Gmail by selecting  ICS Gmail</strong> at  elnino.ics.uci.edu , too.  Save your new settings.  The changes can take up to two hours to propagate. 
 Activate your ICS Gmail by visiting  www.gmail.com  and entering your ICS credentials (username@ics.uci.edu and your ICS password).  If you already have a personal Gmail account, you will need to click  Add an Account</strong> to proceed.  If your password was successfully changed, you should be able to log in and will receive a welcome agreement/screen.  Please accept and continue to UCI Gmail's inbox.  If you wish to read your ICS mail only via a web browser, you can stop here. Otherwise, continue.   
 If you will be using Thunderbird (or any other mail client) to read your ICS Gmail mail, you need to enable Gmail's IMAP feature at  www.gmail.com .  Select the  Gear symbol</strong> on your top right corner,  Settings</strong>,  Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong>,  Enable Map</strong>, and  Save Changes</strong>. 
 Now, choose which folders you want to display on your email client.  Select the  Gear symbol</strong> on your top right corner,  Settings</strong>,  Labels</strong>, and click on  Show</strong> and  Show in IMAP </strong>as needed.  
 Next, you will add your newly-created ICS Gmail account to Thunderbird.   
  Configuring Thunderbird for ICS Gmail 
  Start Thunderbird for the first time or go to  Tools</strong>,  Account Settings</strong>, down to  Account Actions</strong>, select, and  Add Mail Account</strong> if you have existing accounts configured on Thunderbird. 
 In the  Mail Account Setup  window, enter your name and email address.  Enter your password here if you want to have it remembered. Click  Continue</strong>. 
 Thunderbird will now attempt to look for the IMAP information. Please make sure that you have  IMAP </strong>selected. 
 Click on  Manual config  in the lower left corner.  Enter the information as follows:
  Incoming
  IMAP 
 Server hostname:  imap.gmail.com</strong> 
 Port:  993</strong> 
 SSL:  SSL/TLS</strong> 
 Authentication:  Normal password</strong> 
  
 Outgoing
  Server hostname:  smtp.gmail.com</strong> 
 Port:  587</strong> 
 SSL:  STARTTLS</strong> 
 Authentication:  Normal password</strong> 
 Username:  username@ics.uci.edu</strong> 
  
   
    
 Click  Re-test</strong> and then  Done</strong>. 
 If you  did not  choose to have your password saved, you will now be prompted to enter your email password.
   
  
 Go to  Tools </strong>and select  Account Settings</strong>. Under your new account's  Server Settings</strong>, click on the  Advanced  button to your right.
  Make sure that  IMAP server directory  is empty.  
 Uncheck  Show only subscribed folders  if checked.  
 Uncheck  Allow server to override these namespaces  if checked. 
  
   
    
 If you have multiple accounts, you might want to display your ICS Gmail account first.  To do so, on  Account Settings</strong>, select your ICS Gmail account from the left pane,  Account Actions</strong> at the bottom,  Set as Default</strong>.  Please restart to have the changes applied. 
 If you want multiple accounts and want to use ICS Gmail to send emails, on  Account Settings</strong>, select  Outgoing Server (SMTP)</strong> at the bottom of the left pane.  Select  smtp.gmail.com</strong> and click on  Set Default</strong>.  Make sure that your SMTP username is listed as username@ics.uci.edu.  Click  OK</strong>.  
   
 You may copy signatures between accounts.  On  Account Settings</strong>, select the account you want to copy the signature from on the left pane, go to  Signature text</strong> on the right and copy whatever text/file path you have set there.  Now select the account you want to copy the signature to and paste whatever text/file path you copied. 
 This last step is optional. If you have many email messages, you may want to disable Message Synchronizing so that your email loads more quickly. 
  On  Account Settings</strong>, select  Synchronization &amp; Storage</strong> for your new account.   
 Uncheck  Keep messages for this account on this computer</strong>. 
  
 
Now you may start drag and dropping messages and folders within your accounts.  Please note that if your folders contain thousands of messages, it will take a long time to complete the transfer.  Plan accordingly.  If you have any questions, email helpdesk@ics.uci.edu.
