 Stride Prefetch<body>

  Stride Prefetch  
      Mainly used to eliminate compulsory/capacity miss
 
     Prediction: if a memory address is missed, an address that is offset by a distance from the missed address is likely to be missed in near future
 
     Scenario for prediction to be useful: stride access
 
     Architecture implementation: when an address miss, prefetch address that is offset by a distance from the missed address. When there is a hit in buffer, also prefetch the address that is offset by a distance from the hit address.
