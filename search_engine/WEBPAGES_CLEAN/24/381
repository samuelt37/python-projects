Meldable RAM priority queues and
minimum spanning trees
 
Jeremy Yu Meng
 
 
The authors describe two general techniques for transforming
non-meldable priority queues into meldable ones.  Using the resultant
priority queues of the first type, they obtain improved algorithms
for finding minimum directed spanning trees in graphs with integer
weights.
  
From Meldable RAM priority queues and
minimum spanning trees, from SODA '04, by Ran Mendelson, Mikkel
Thorup, and Uri Zwick (pages 40--48 in the proceedings).
