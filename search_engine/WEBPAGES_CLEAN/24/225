        CLIQUES' main objective is to fill a gap in the area 
            of secure group communication by investigating group security services, 
            designing a family of flexible and efficient cryptographic mechanisms, 
            realizing it in a general-purpose toolkit and demonstrating its 
            functionality by integration with diverse group-oriented applications. 
             
             CLIQUES is concerned primarily with group-oriented security services 
            such as:     
            Key Agreement in Peer Groups   
            Authentication   
            Group Membership Changes   
            Membership Non-repudiation
