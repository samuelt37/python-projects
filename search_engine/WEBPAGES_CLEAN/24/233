4.27 OEChemGetVersion 
 
   
unsigned int OEChemGetVersion
    
Return the version number of the OEChem library being used.  This is
an unsigned integer value indicating the date on which the library was
built, for example 20020903, for the 3rd September 2002.  This value
should be used when reporting problems, and unlike the release string
returned by the OEChemGetRelease function, may be used in comparisons
if needed.
