&gt; &gt;Well, there's already precedent for form URLs, for example, e.g.,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   http://host.dom/form-handler?x=a+y=b+z=c 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;even though the client treats any URL it receieves as 'opaque', they
&gt; &gt;can still be constructed. I see some value in just continuing this
&gt; &gt;tradition for versions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In fact, how about making a "version" just a special kind of
&gt; &gt;query?
&gt;
&gt; Dan Connolly agreed, stating:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Fair enough. ?version=xxx seems reasonable for (a)
&gt;
&gt; Thus, there appears to be some agreement that employing the URL parameter
&gt; or URL query field would be useful for specifying the version of an entity.
&gt;
&gt; However, it is not entirely clear to me what the tradeoffs are between
&gt; using the URL parameter mechanism (e.g., ";version={version identifier}")
&gt; versus using the URL query mechanism (e.g., "?version={version
&gt; identifier}").  Can any members of the list shed some light on the intent
&gt; of these two mechanisms?  This information is unavailable in either the
&gt; HTTP specification or RFC 1738 (Uniform Resource Locators).


I also agree that the "?version={version identifier}" mechanism is a good
choice,
for practical reasons - regardless of the original intent of the spec ;-).
(I also looked for a hard distinction between "parameter" and "query" in
the RFCs and found nothing
conclusive - Dan, any thoughts on this?).

While both "?version={version identifier}" and ";version={version
identifier}" appear to be valid
constructs, forms submission capability might be a consideration here.
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" forms submission causes current forms
supporting user-agents to construct a
URL using the query mechanism.
The query mechanism would therefore give us the added benefit of allowing
either the user to specifiy the
version identifier via a form element *or* the author to "hardcode" the
version identifier into the URL within
the tag (anchor,img etc...).
So, I'd say the query mechanism looks slightly more preferable.
