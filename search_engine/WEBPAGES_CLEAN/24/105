       CompSci 271: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2014 
         
        



  
       Project Outline  
     

        

        Students should form teams of 2-3 (preferably 3) per project. 
         Projects can be of the following types 
          Article-centered project.
           For details see below.    Programming project.
           For details see below.    Your own project idea, on the topic of AI (e.g., implementing an algorithm and applying to some domain). 
           Students need to obtain approval before proceeding.   Each team needs to submit a written report (one report per team) at the end of the course (exact date TDB). 
         Teams should be formed and project proposals finalized/approved by early Nov at the latest. 
         
         

       Article-centered project 
        

         A project can be centered on 1-2 primary articles selected from a recent AI conference/journal. A list of selected conferences is below, as well as a list of selected papers.

         The idea is that the paper will open a window to a subject that the students read and explore.
         You may need to read earlier papers for background and information (that appear in the citations of the primary papers).
         Students may investigate the validity of paper by running code developed on some benchmarks whenever relevant.



         The team will 
          write a project report to be handed in at the end of the course.
         The project report should include a description and evaluation of the paper and any creative independent work carried out by the team.

        
         

       Programming project 
        

           A project can consist of picking a particular problem class and task (e.g. solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems),
           and writing a computer program to solve problem instances of this class. There are repositories of benchmarks that
           students can get problem instances, for example

              UCI repository  
                 Cost Function Optimization problems
