 DEDICATION 
 
To 
my parents, 
 
Pete and Kathleen Fielding, 
 
who made all of this possible, 
for their endless encouragement and patience. 
 
  
 
And also to 
 
Tim Berners-Lee, 
 
for making the World Wide Web an open, collaborative project. 
 
  
 
   
 
What is life? 
It is the flash of a firefly in the night. 
It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. 
It is the little shadow which runs across the grass 
and loses itself in the sunset.  -- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator. 
 
     
    
 
Almost everybody feels at peace with nature: listening to the ocean waves against the shore, by a still lake, in a field of grass, on a windblown heath. One day, when we have learned the timeless way again, we shall feel the same about our towns, and we shall feel as much at peace in them, as we do today walking by the ocean, or stretched out in the long grass of a meadow.  -- Christopher Alexander, The Timeless Way of Building (1979)
