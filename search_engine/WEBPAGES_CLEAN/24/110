   On nearest-neighbor graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. S. Paterson ,
and F. F. Yao.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  17: 263â€“282, 1997 .
 
Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things
that any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter  D  has O( D  9 ) vertices.
This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists
of improving that bound to O( D  5 ), which is tight.
