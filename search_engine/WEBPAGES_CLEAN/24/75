 Guidelines for Menu Hierarchies<body>
    Guidelines for menu hierarchies   
      Submenus of the currently 
touched menu item should be automatically shown (30% less search time and 50% 
less errors for beginning users, Snowberry et al., 1985).           
  Menus should not be deeply nested (2-3 
levels only).       The 
menu lenght should not exceed 3-12 items. Menus may be longer if they are grouped 
or if items have a natural sequence.       On 
the top level and particularly on the bottom ("leaf") level, menus should be longer 
than in the middle of the hierarchy (Norman &amp; Chin, 1988).     
  Longer menus are better when working 
under time pressure (Wallace, 1988)       The 
total number of  different  menus in a hierarchy should be low (Norman 1991). 
If possible, combine two or more intermediate menus into a single one and deactivate 
those menu items that do not occur in the respective navigation path.     
  All entries of the same level should 
fit on a screen (no scrolling should be necessary).       The 
hierarchy should be constructed thematically. Sometimes menu hierarchies can be 
constructed based on which items are frequently selected together.     
  Constructing hierarchies top-down or 
bottom-up? (Chin, 1986):       Top-down 
approach yields broader trees (more menu entries on the top level) and deeper 
trees. The emphasis lies on the discrimination of the differences between items.     
  Bottom-up approach yields narrower 
trees with broad lowermost level. The emphasis lies on the clustering of related 
items.     *     Use 
a combined approach.         Consider 
menu shortcuts to deeper hierarchy levels.       External 
consistency (with previous program versions or competitive programs): changing 
the hierarchical position of menu entries is o.k., as long as lexical identity 
is preserved (Foltz et al., 1988).    </body>
