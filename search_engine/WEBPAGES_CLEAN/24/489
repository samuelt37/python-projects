  Observations/Conclusions  
      Requirements/Observations for a Process Isolation Scheme
 
  Out of line implicit checking through modes, external units (e.g. addressing)
  Complex schemes *not* used (e.g. protection rings, capabilities, ACL�s, etc.) at the hardware level
  Nearly all of the hardware within a conventional processor core is potentially configurable� more sensitive is the TLB/Address checking, a few choice bits of machine state (e.g. privilege level) and a few key instructions
  novel operations, instructions, use of registers, datapath, caches, and anything else?
         Plans: Complete analysis and write an architecture requirements / capabilities document for protected execution in the presence of reconfigurable hardware
 
  Can we make all of the useful distinctions yet? (unclear)
