          The 
        Workshop series on    
        Internet-scale 
        Software Technologies (TWIST)  
       The TWIST series aims to gather participants from industry and academia 
        who are researching or developing software technologies that scale to 
        the Internet. TWIST provides a forum for discussion and enables quick 
        dissemination of current ideas within a well-targeted audience. The goals 
        of the workshop series are developing a better understanding among the 
        different communities of interest, improved definition of requirements 
        for scaling to the Internet, better appreciation of the application domains 
        that require or benefit from this approach, and suggestions for fruitful 
        research directions.
