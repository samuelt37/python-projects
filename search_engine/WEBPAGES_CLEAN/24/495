Thanks for putting the list together Jim.  This'll make it
simpler to compose new messages :-).

Your WG page looks good.  It pointed out several resources that I
hadn't heard of yet.

Right now, I'm trying to figure out if I want to go to Montreal
for the IETF meetings at the end of june.  The plus is that it
will actually be a domestic business trip for me (first one in
about 8 years).  The minus is that it's a week away from the
office.  Do we want to schedule a BOF for the group, or add an
agenda item to the HTTP WG meetings?  If nobody else is going to
be there, I'm not going to bother.
