A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.
  
Merged with
" Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts "
to form the journal version, " Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts ".
