        AND/OR Branch-and-Bound Search for Combinatorial Optimization in Graphical Models    
        Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
    	  We introduce a new generation of depth-first Branch-and-Bound algorithms
    	  that explore the AND/OR search tree using static and dynamic variable
    	  orderings for solving general constraint  optimization problems. The virtue of
    	  the AND/OR representation of the search space is that its size may be far
    	  smaller than that of a traditional OR representation, which can translate into
    	  significant time savings for search algorithms. The focus of this paper is
    	  on linear space search which explores the AND/OR search tree rather than
    	  the search graph and therefore make no attempt to cache information.
    	  We investigate the power of the mini-bucket heuristics within the AND/OR
    	  search space, in both static and dynamic setups. We focus on two most
    	  common optimization problems in graphical models: finding the Most
    	  Probable Explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks and solving Weighted
    	  CSPs (WCSP). In extensive empirical evaluations we demonstrate that the
    	  new AND/OR Branch-and-Bound approach improves considerably over the
    	  traditional OR search strategy and show how various variable ordering
    	  schemes impact the performance of the AND/OR search scheme.
