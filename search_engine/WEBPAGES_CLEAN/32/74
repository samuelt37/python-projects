 Dynamic Architecture Resources<body>  Software Adaptation Repository   This site serves as a continuation of the work begun by theadaptation group at the  Workshopon Compositional Software Architectures . Our goal is todiscuss and catalog different software adaptation mechanisms. Inour context,  adaptivity  means changing systems in waysthat were not anticipated by their designers, and for which theright "hooks" are not present in the design.         Catalog of various                adaptation mechanisms     A growing catalog of adaptation                mechanisms. Use  this                template  to propose new mechanisms.              Glossary of terms    (available soon)             Bibliography    (available soon)             Adaptation Mailing List    The mailing list serves as a forum for                discussing adaptation mechanisms.
