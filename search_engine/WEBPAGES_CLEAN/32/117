 Abstract  
It was recently shown that the problem of decoding messages transmitted through a noisy
channel can be formulated as a belief updating task over a probabilistic network [14].
Moreover, it was observed that iterative application of the (linear time) belief 
propagation algorithm designed for polytrees [15] outperformed state of the art 
decoding algorithms, even though the corresponding networks may have many cycles.
This paper demonstrates empirically that an approximation algorithm approx-mpe
for solving the most probable explanation (MPE) problem, developed within the
recently proposed mini-bucket elimination framework [4], outperforms iterative belief
propagation on classes of coding networks that have bounded induced width. Our 
experiments suggest that approximate MPE decoders can be good competitors to the 
approximate belief updating decoders.
