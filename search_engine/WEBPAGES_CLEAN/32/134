   “ A NEW VISION OF INNOVATION ”</strong> 
    
 Abstract: 

 In this talk Sanjay will discuss how SAP, a large global software company, is experimenting with a radically different innovation concept called HanaHaus which was successfully launched in the 

Silicon Valley under his leadership. The idea and vision for HanaHaus was conceptualized by Dr. Hasso Plattner, Co-founder and Chairman of SAP, to create an ecosystem to foster a vibrant culture of technology, innovation and entrepreneurship beyond the boundaries of SAP. 
     Sanjay Shirolé</strong>  is a Vice President at the SAP Innovation Center Silicon Valley where he heads the SCALE effort. Sanjay and his team help build and launch new products for early adopter customers. Before joining SAP, Sanjay spent over 15 years as an entrepreneur successfully founding and leading two software startups in the Silicon Valley, including Xora, a global leader in mobile, cloud based,  location aware workforce management solutions. He is very passionate about entrepreneurship, especially as it relates to the democratization of technology for small and medium businesses. He continues to mentor and provide advice to technology entrepreneurs worldwide.

   " TO BOT OR NOT: HOW BOTS CAN SUPPORT COLLABORATION IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT "</strong> 

        
 Abstract: 

 Software development stakeholders require a constellation of tools to support their communication, collaboration and coordination activities. But poor tool integration can lead to gaps in knowledge flow, or worse, to an overabundance of shared communication and information. The software development community is witnessing the rise of "social bots" to integrate diverse development and communication tools and to address the challenge of information overload. A bot is a conversational user interface that can automate rote or tedious tasks. It may fetch or share information, extract and analyze data, detect and monitor events and activities in communication and social media, connect developers with each other or with other tools, or it may provide feedback on individual and collaborative development tasks. Some bots are emerging as important team members, providing support for individual and team task management and for the automation of dev-ops and customer support. However, the rapid adoption of bots and the platforms that support them brings possible drawbacks. Designing effective platforms for bots is challenging and bots may introduce alienation among stakeholders or lead to other technical challenges. In this talk, I will discuss the emerging role of bots in software development and describe some of the advantages and challenges that may lie ahead. 
     Dr. Margaret-Anne Storey</strong>  is a Professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Software Engineering program at the University of Victoria.  She holds a Canada Research Chair in Human and Social Aspects of Software Engineering. Her research goal is to understand how technology can help people explore, understand, and share complex information and knowledge. She evaluates and applies techniques from knowledge engineering, social software, and visual interface design to applications such as collaborative software development, program comprehension, biomedical ontology development, and learning in Web-based environments.

   " THE ABCs OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: AFFECT, BIOMETRICS, AND COGNITION  "</strong> 
            
 Abstract: 

 Researchers have long investigated how people read, write, and speak about software on their computers to identify the skills, education, and practices needed need to acquire expertise and perform development duties effectively and efficiently. However, until now the methods used to study developer comprehension, expression, and communication have been limited and coarse-grained because there was no way to identify what a developer thought or felt unless it was expressed out loud. 

 The world has changed. With the introduction of low-cost, widely available, high-fidelity biometric sensors, we can now more directly observe a software developer's cognitive and affective (emotional) processes. The ABCs of Software Engineering is a set of techniques that modernize classic approaches to program comprehension and human interaction by combining (A) principles governing the influence of human *affect* on behavior, (B) *biometric* sensors, and (C) models of *cognition* informed by advances in cognitive neuroscience. Technologies like electroencephalography (EEG), electro-dermal activity sensors (EDA), capacitive sensors, and eye trackers can reveal a software developer's internal emotional states, for example identifying when the developer is confused, frustrated, surprised, stressed, fatigued, or in a highly productive flow state. These affective states can be correlated with code quality, software complexity, development productivity, and effective communication --- the same software outcomes already correlated with developer activities in other research areas such as mining software repositories (MSR) and cooperative and human aspects of software engineering (CHASE). By developing a better understanding of what programmers think and feel when they create and maintain software, we can design tools and interventions to improve their productivity and reduce the impact of their errors. 
     Andrew Begel</strong>  is a Senior Researcher in the VIBE group at Microsoft Research. Andrew studies software engineers to understand how communication, collaboration and coordination behaviors impact their effectiveness in collocated and distributed development. He then builds software tools that incentivize problem-mitigating behaviors. Andrew’s recent work focuses on the intersection of social computing and software engineering, and on the use of biometrics to better understand how software developers do their work.
