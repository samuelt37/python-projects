    Most of
  the modern large point data sets are produced by devices that sample the
  object/scene regularly in the device space. We are seeking to detect,
  characterize and exploit the regularity patterns that arise in sampling due
  to the characteristics of the scanning device, enabling applications such as
  efficient compression and watermarking. We're also investigating novel
  approaches for rendering such point clouds efficiently.     
         
     
    A pseudo-regular 3D scanned point
  data set created by merging multiple scans from a translational scanner is
  decomposed into three scans (top row), and the three 2D chart
