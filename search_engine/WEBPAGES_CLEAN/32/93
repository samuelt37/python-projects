 Geometry in Action: Motion Planning<body>

 
 
  
 
  
  Robot Motion Planning 

The study of exact algorithms for robot motion planning
forms a major subarea of computational geometry,
with connections also to symbolic and algebraic computation.
Note that motion planning is useful not only for computer control of
actual robots; in his invited talk at FOCS 1995, Jean-Claude Latombe
showed impressive videos of applications of the same techniques
in assembly planning and to
 computer animation .

methods  for following the evolution of interfaces, J. Sethian,
Berkeley.  The basic idea is to solve various "advancing front" type problems
such as finding shortest paths around obstacles, by evolving a surface
in one higher dimension that describes the dynamics of the front.
Includes movies and Java applets describing applications to
VLSI design, medical image processing, noise removal from images, and
robot motion planning.
