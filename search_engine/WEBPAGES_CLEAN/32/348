At the San Mateo meeting there was some discussion regarding HTTP/1.1
Entity Tags, and their potential use in distributed versioning schemes.
There was some belief that Entity Tags could be useful in this context, and
an action item was taken to investigate whether this was true.

Entity tags are described in the HTTP/1.1, Rev. 6 specification in section
13.3, "Validation Model", and also 14.20, "ETag."

I'm looking for volunteers to investigate this issue and give a short
decription to the group on this topic.  Any takers?
