 ICS 269, Spring 2005: Theory Seminar 
 11 Mar 2005: 
Skip Graphs and Family Trees: Two Ordered Dictionaries for Distributed
Systems 
Presented by Michael Nelson
 

 
Abstract: The talk will focus on two solutions to the problem of storing
a dynamic ordered dictionary over a distributed set of nodes.  Both of
these data structures can support efficient search operations as well as
range queries.  The talk will include definitions of the two data
structures, an outline of their fundamental routines, and a discussion of
their theoretical performance.  

  
The content of the talk is taken from the following two papers: 
"Skip Graphs" by James Aspnes and Gauri Shah, appeared in SODA 2003 
"Family Trees" by Kevin C. Zatloukal and Nicholas J. A. Harvey, appeared
in SODA 2004  </body>
