        How to create a new Translation Layer 

    	    Introduction 
	    	 
	    		In this section we will explain which are the steps for creating and using
	    		a new translational layer. So, let's start.
	    	 
    	 

    	    Extend AbstractStorageServer 
    		 
    			The first step is to create a StorageServer extending the class org.itr_rescue.dataGuard.StorageServer.AbstractStorageServer.
    			The methods  connect ,  disconnect ,  fetch ,  store ,  delete  must be
    			override in such a way to interact with the server.
    		 
    	 

    	    Add the layer in DataGuard 
    		 
    			Now, you have to crate a JLinkLabel; The JLinkLabels are the components which are visible when you start
    			DataGuard on the right panel. There is one JLinkLabel for each translational layer. The JLinkLabel provide
    			an hyperlink to the service, a service description and a service icon if available.
    			So, you have to:
    		 
    		 
    			   Create your JLinkLabel extending org.itr_rescue.dataGuard.ui.JLinkLabel 
    				 Override the method  mouseClicked  defining what to do when the object is clicked 
    				  Facultative  - Override methods that define the service description and the service icon 
    				 Add the service name and the your JLinkLabel's name into resources/properties/services.props 
    			  

    	    Creating a new Remote View 

		  	The current prototype of DataGuard contains only one Remote View. With this view DataGuard represents
		  	the hierarchical structure of a file system. So, the view contains file and folder organized in a tree
		  	structure.


    			If you want a different object's representation, feel free to define other remote view. For instance, you can
    			create a remote view of images based of thumbnails as well as a remote view with a calendar interface.
    			The Remote View is only the virtual representation of your objects at the server, hence, there are no
    			limit in the number of different view we can build.
