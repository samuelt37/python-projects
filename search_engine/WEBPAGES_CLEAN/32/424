 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Binary Transformations  Intent       Binary transformations rewrite portions of an application    to introduce new functionality.   Also Known As       Binary Patch files.   Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Binary transformations have the following benefits:        They don't require source code . Since the            transformation is performed on object or executable            code, the source code of the application is not            required for adaptation.           They can be used for fault isolation .            Applications can be modified to prevent certain            undesireable behavior during execution. This is            commonly refered to as sandboxing (executing the code            in an a restricted environment).       Binary transformations have the following limitations:       They are low-level.          They are difficult to compose.        Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses       EEL from University of Wisconsin, Pure Atria's  Purify     and  Quantify     are examples of binary transformations.   Related Mechanisms        What mechanisms are closely related to this one? What    are the important differences? With which other mechanisms    should this one be used?        Backto the Adaptation home page   .
