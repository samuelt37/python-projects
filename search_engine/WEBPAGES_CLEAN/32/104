    As you take the next step in your academic career by applying to colleges and universities this fall, we would like to invite you to consider the   Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences</strong>  (Bren:ICS) at UCIrvine. 
 Computer science was once perceived merely as programming, but those days are long gone. In this modern age, computer science has become a very diverse field, with its impact being felt in how we experience and transform medicine, transportation, entertainment, the environment, finance, business, and many others. The opportunities for cross-disciplinary engagement are boundless.

 Plus, we continue to innovate. For example, we are currently developing a new major in  Computer Game Science</strong>. At Bren:ICS, your curiosity will lead you beyond your coursework ­– engaging in undergraduate  research </strong>with our  nearly 70 faculty, </strong>and  interdisciplinary collaborations </strong>with other students and faculty across campus ­– to help shape the future of computer science.   
 A Bren:ICS education provides you with a blend of science, scholarship, technical skills, and practical experience. You will leave prepared for the real world ­– whether you are interested in technology, computer games, the environment, medicine or the law.  
    With 1.5 million new information technology jobs to be created in the United States over the next ten years*, there is no better time to join us and prepare you for an exciting career ahead.
