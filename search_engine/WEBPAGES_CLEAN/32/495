We will attempt to identify the key open topics,   assess their importance in the long term, and develop a research agenda for   tackling those issues.  The class will operate as a research seminar: I will lecture occasionally,   but there will be numerous presentations by students. The focus of class time   will be discussion of what's been learned outside of class.  Grading will be based on participation in the class, and a term paper +/- a   project. (That means, you'll almost assuredly have to write a term paper, and   that paper in many cases will reflect work you've done in a project.) Projects   can certainly be worked on in teams. We might even be using p2p technologies   to support the teams! It is highly unlikely that there will be a final exam.  Prerequisite Knowledge  Students should have some background in software engineering including exposure   to the basic ideas of software architecture. This is a research seminar and   students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions and presentations.   Some form of project will take place and to be successful with that students   will need to be able to independently acquire, install, adapt, and experiment   with externally developed p2p systems. Students will also need to independently   discover, obtain, and analyze publications germane to the topic, and present   the results of those investigations to the class.  Research Issues  There's a lot of research issues in this domain. The following list gives you   some idea.   The relationship between requirements and architecture-based development,     with a focus on mapping between them, or transformation, or development: all     this as applied particularly to the P2P domain    Supporting  groups  of people with peer-to-peer (p2p) infrastructure.     "WebDAV grows up." Supporting little processes; social issues; quick setup     and tear-down.      Search  technologies in the p2p world.     Designing, modeling, and implementing p2p applications       formal models         an architecture based approach; xADL + richer groups, process, and security         responsibility, ownership, and intellectual property models           Analyzing p2p architectures     Pervasive p2p applications. Think ubiquitous computing as implemented by     p2p applications and micro-networking.     P2P infrastructures and network issues/security issues.     Instant messaging, p2p, and process. Protocols for this, infrastructure,     and interoperability.     Events: XML rep and interchange in the p2p space and beyond    The Ultimate Peer-to-Peer Protocol (TuP3)   Comparison Factors  The following list is incomplete, but illustrates the kinds of factors we'll   be looking at in evaluating peer-to-peer architectures   Overview       Contact Information         Overview         Best Feature         Most Telling Criticisms         Business Model         Target Companies         Investors         Terms and Conditions         History         Product Trajectory         Source of Info           Peer Applications       Searching         Synchronization         Collaboration         Decentralized Work         Remote Control         Dispatching         Backup         E/M-commerce         Home Networking          Clients       Main GUI         Coupled/Decoupled         Others         Ease of Use         Installation         Learning Curve         Drag &amp; Drop         Auditing         Extensions         Electronic Wallet          Networking       Disconnected         Mobile         Security         Firewall         Writeable         Two-way Routing         Replication         Discovery         Wireless Access          Scalability       Broadcast/Anycast         Namespaces         Event Notification         Web Integration         Publish/Subscribe         Embedded         SyncML/XML         WML/XHTML           Robustness     Extensibility     Open Source    Example P2P systems and infrastructure  We'll categorize and examine several of these...    Magi       Groove.Net  (and since their site is     such a mess, you might zip to  http://devzone.groove.net/library/      )      eMikolo       Lightshare       Flycode  (Apple Soup)      Kalepa       MojoNation       Napster       Gnutella       Freenet       Aimster  1.0      Scour      Static (is now  Blue Falcon )     GameSpy      a bit off-beat, I'll admit, but you might try looking at this link      iMesh       Pointera       GoneSilent  (Infrasearch)      Popular Power  (now out of business,     but the  original site      is still there)    United Devices       Radio Userland       KnowNow      Infraworks      Agranat      US Software      Enfish       Engenia  (and they have     now acquired the assets of Roku)     Kazaa      Morpheus/MusicCity      Omniprise     Think Desk    Avaki    HotComm       Textbooks  Required:     Peer-to-Peer: Harnessing     the Power of Disruptive Technologies  , Edited by Andy Oram.

Nonetheless   I suppose someone might plagiarize sooner or later. Thus: "Cheating in   ICS 280 will be punished in accordance with  University   policy  and     ICS policy.  Please familiarize yourself with those documents. Note that   University policy states that faculty have the responsibility of "assigning   an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty."   That appropriate grade, for this class, is an F. Cheating is wrong. Don't do   it."      Citations  Here's some background documents that may be relevant to your projects.   " Peer-to-peer:     A security nightmare or a secure opportunity " The Magi folks.    "An efficient and open implementation of the  Minstrel      broadcasting infrastructure" Stefan Haberl, TU Wien.
