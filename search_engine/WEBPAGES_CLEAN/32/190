   Here are some resources for finding papers not directly
  linked from the class home page, including resources you might use for your
  term paper. 
       
   Please note, that many of these only give you �full text
  access� when you are using a computer that has a UCI IP address or that you
  have logged on outside of UCI using the VPN capability (see NACS at  http://www.nacs.uci.edu/security/vpn.html ).
