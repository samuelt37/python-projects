   I have moved to Arizona State University.  
 Please visit me   there   
 

 

My research interests lie in the broad area of   Software for 
Embedded Systems  with a particular focus on the
processor architecture - compiler boundary. 
I have developed a software toolkit for automatic Compiler-in-the-Loop
exploration of Embedded Systems. 
My other interests are in CAD algorithms and high-level synthesis.
