   Data Set Information:  
 The dataset could contain missing values. The data was sampled every minute, computing and uploading it smoothed with 15 minute means. The header of the data file is a commentary (begins with #) indicating which data is stored at which column (in Spanish). The data is time information is in UTC. 

   Attribute Information:  
 The attributes are:  1. Date: in UTC. 2. Time: in UTC. 3. Indoor temperature (dinning-room), in ÂºC. 4. Indoor temperature (room), in ÂºC. 5. Weather forecast temperature, in ÂºC. 6. Carbon dioxide in ppm (dinning room). 7. Carbon dioxide in ppm (room). 8. Relative humidity (dinning room), in %. 9. Relative humidity (room), in %. 10. Lighting (dinning room), in Lux. 11. Lighting (room), in Lux. 12. Rain, the proportion of the last 15 minutes where rain was detected (a value in range [0,1]). 13. Sun dusk. 14. Wind, in m/s. 15. Sun light in west facade, in Lux. 16. Sun light in east facade, in Lux. 17. Sun light in south facade, in Lux. 18. Sun irradiance, in W/m2. 19. Enthalpic motor 1, 0 or 1 (on-off). 20. Enthalpic motor 2, 0 or 1 (on-off). 21. Enthalpic motor turbo, 0 or 1 (on-off). 22. Outdoor temperature, in ÂºC. 23. Outdoor relative humidity, in %. 24. Day of the week (computed from the date), 1=Monday, 7=Sunday.
