3.34.6 GetFragmentNumber 
 

 
    
int GetFragmentNumber() const
    
Return the fragment number property of a residue.  Fragment numbers
are integer indices that define connected components of a
macromolecule.  When reading from a PDB file, the first atom is placed
in fragment number 1.  Each time a ``TER'', ``END'' or ``ENDM'' record is
encountered within a single connection table, the fragment number is
incremented.  Similarly, when writing a PDB file, a TER record is
written between any consecutive pair of atoms with different fragment
numbers.  The fragment number property may be set using the
OEResidue::SetFragment number property.
