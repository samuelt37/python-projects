The objective of the Electronic Systems Test Workshop (ESTW) is to
bring together researchers in all of the fields related to the test of
entire systems. The heterogeneous nature of electronic system design
necessitates the integration of different research communities to
address the system test problem. Currently research in each related
field is performed by largely distinct research communites including
digital IC test, mixed-signal test, embedded system test,
hardware/software coverification, and software test. As a result,
there has been little effort towards the development of a coherent
science of system test. This workshop will act as a forum for the
broad collaboration required to establish a research foundation for
the field of system test.
