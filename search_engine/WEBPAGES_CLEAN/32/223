              Abstract   
              This paper provides algorithms for predicting the
              size of the Expanded Search Tree (EST) of Depth-first Branch and Bound algorithms (DFBnB) for
              optimization tasks. The prediction algorithm is implemented and evaluated in the context of solving
              combinatorial optimization problems over graphical models such as Bayesian and Markov networks.
              Our methods extend to DFBnB the approaches provided by Knuth-Chen schemes that were designed
              and applied for predicting the EST size of backtracking search algorithms. Our empirical results
              demonstrate good predictions which are superior to
              competing schemes.
