 Versioning Protocol<body>

  Versioning Protocol  
      A protocol document on how to perform remote versioning and variant authoring via HTTP
 
     A placeholder at the moment, since versioning was removed from the DA protocol draft
 
     Goal is to have a final document by June, 1998.
 
     There is a �V� in WebDAV :-)
