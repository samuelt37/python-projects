    Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   2nd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Durham, North Carolina, 1997.   6th Int. Meshing Roundtable,  Park
City, Utah, 1997, pp. 7–19 .  arXiv:cs.CG/9908016 .  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  10 (4): 347–360, 2000.
 
We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

This paper shows how to use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " for some non-geometric problems including
hierarchical clustering,

    Geometric thickness of complete graphs .  M. Dillencourt ,
D. Eppstein, and 
 
D. S. Hirschberg .   6th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, 
Montreal, August 1998 . 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  1547, 1998, pp. 102–110.  arXiv:math.CO/9910185 .   J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications  4 (3): 5–17, 2000 
(special issue for GD98).
 
We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
" The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The
Computer J.  51: 292–302, 2008.

    Incremental and decremental maintenance of planar width . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/9809038 .  
 10th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 1999, pp. S899-S900 .   J.
Algorithms  37 (2): 570–577, 2000 .
 
We show how to maintain the width of a planar point set, subject to
insertions or deletions (but not both) in time
O( n   c  ) per update for any  c  &gt; 0.
The idea is to apply our  dynamic closest pair
data structure  to an appropriate measure of distance between
pairs of convex hull features.

    Regression depth and center points .  N. Amenta ,
 M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and
 S.-H. Teng .  arXiv:cs.CG/9809037 .   3rd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Brown Univ., 1998.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  23 (3): 305–323, 2000 .
 
We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
 regression depth  at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

    The distribution of cycle lengths in graphical models for iterative decoding .  X. Ge ,
D. Eppstein, and
 P. Smyth .  arXiv:cs.DM/9907002 .  Tech.
Rep. 99-10 , ICS, UCI, 1999.  IEEE Int. Symp. Information
Theory , Sorrento, Italy, 2000.  IEEE Trans. Information Theory  47 (6): 2549–2553, 2001.
 
We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.
Note, the TR, conference, and journal versions of this paper have
slightly different titles.

    Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/9912013 .  
 16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  28 (1): 1–17, 2002.
 
We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".

MSRI Combinatorial Game Theory Research Worksh., July 2000.  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 433–453 .
 
We describe software that searches for
 spaceships in Conway's Game of
Life and related two-dimensional cellular automata .
Our program searches through a state space
related to the de Bruijn graph of the automaton,
using a method that combines features of breadth first and
iterative deepening search, and includes fast
bit-parallel  graph reachability 
and  path enumeration  algorithms
for finding the successors of each state.
Successful results include a
 new 2c/7
spaceship in Life , found by searching a space with 2^126 states.

We describe by a regular expression the one-dimensional peg-solitaire
positions reducible to a single peg, and provide a linear-time algorithm
(based on finding  shortest paths  in an
associated DAG) for
reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg
solitaire moves in an attempt to be the one to move last.

 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 351–360 .
 
We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's
Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the
current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In
contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

 12th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Washington, 2001, pp. 827–835 .
 
Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,
and find an O(n 3/2 ) time algorithm for testing whether
a rule set contains any ambiguities.

(special issue for WADS'01) 7 (2): 131–140, 2003 .
 
We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.
