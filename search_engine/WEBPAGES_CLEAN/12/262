&gt; VTML can be lock-free, in which case you're not guaranteed what version
&gt; you'll get on check-in.

You can get consistent semantics without locking by using entity tags
and if-match: that is, do a POST to update the resource but only if
the entity had not changed since the last time you did a GET and the
entity tag matched. This is probably useful to get standard.
