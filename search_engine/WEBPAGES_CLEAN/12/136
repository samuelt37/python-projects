4.4 OEAddExplicitHydrogens 
 
   
void OEAddExplicitHydrogens(OEMol &amp;mol,
                            bool polarOnly=false, bool set3D=true)
void OEAddExplicitHydrogens(OEMCMolBase &amp;mol,
                            bool polarOnly=false, bool set3D=true)
void OEAddExplicitHydrogens(OEMolBase &amp;mol,
                            bool polarOnly=false, bool set3D=true)
    
Convert the implicit hydrogens on the atoms of a molecule to explicit
hydrogen atoms.  Zero or more new atoms are created with atomic number
 OEElemNo::H , and new bonds are created to connect these to the parent
atom with a single bond.  This function also resets the implicit hydrogen
count to zero.  If the ``polar only'' argument is true, this function
does nothing if the atom is not polar,  i.e.  when
 OEAtomBase::IsPolar  returns false.

  
The sprouted hydrogens are initially given the same co-ordinates as their
parent atom.  However, if the ``set3D'' parameter is true, the default,
and the given molecule has three dimensional co-ordinates ( i.e. 
 OEMolBase::GetDimension  returns a value of three or more), this
routine automatically calls the  OESet3DHydrogenGeom  function.

  
    
bool OEAddExplicitHydrogens(OEMolBase &amp;mol, OEAtomBase *atm);
    
The form of the  OEAddExplicitHydrogens  function operates only on
the specified  OEAtomBase .  This function creates a new
 OEAtomBase  for every implicit hydrogen on ``atm'', as given
by  atm-&gt;GetImplicitHCount() .  The new hydrogen atoms are given
the same co-ordinates as their parent, ``atm''.  This function
currently always returns true.  To set the 3D geometry of these atoms,
call the  OESet3DHydrogenGeom  function.
