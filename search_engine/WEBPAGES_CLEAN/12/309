operator bool() const
    
This method is used to test for successful initialization of an
 OESubSearch  object.  If initialization was attempted with an
invalid SMARTS pattern or query molecule then this method will return
false.  If initialization was completed successfully this method will
return true.  An instance of  OESubSearch  is considered to be
uninitialized when constructed with the default constructor.
