 Your own wiki homepage 
   After creating an account you can see your own name in the navigation area, which is linked to a page of the same title: your personal homepage!        If you click on this link, you can see one of the unique characteristics of wikis for the first time: instead of getting a  404 not found  error when a non-existent page is called, the wiki helps you create the page.       After following the instructions displayed, the wiki will display a template of your own homepage in a form.       You can change this template, give an optional comment, and then save the page by clicking  save</strong>.
