 Together/J<body>

  Together/J  
     Code is central. The user sees model and code and both are kept in sync. You can compile from within TJ. The find command only searches code, not the model.      Some screenshots were taken from a presentation describing Together/J from Object International. It can be downloaded from www.togetherj.com.
