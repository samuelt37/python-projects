  DAOOPT-UAI12 
   An exact AOBB solver for Most Probable Explanation/MAP in Bayesian/Markov networks. This is a version of the solver with all the features used in the  PASCAL2 Probabilistic Inference Challenge  in 2012.       
  Author 
    Lars_Otten  and  Alex_Ihler        
  Description 
   This is a version of the  DAOOPT  solver using MBE code by Alex Ihler. In addition to the features of the DAOOPT, it includes cost-shifting schemes to tighten the problem formulation (MPLP/JGLP) and the bounds produced by MBE algorithm (MBE with moment-matching). See [1] for details on these methods.       
  Input format 
   The graphical model instance has to be specified in the  UAI file format .       
  Parameters 
   See  DAOOPT  for parameters, or run the exectuable with  --help</strong>.   The following additional parameters are also available in this version.          --match</strong>: Apply moment-matching between mini-buckets        --mplp</strong>: (integer) specifies the maximum number of iterations to run MPLP preprocessing.        --mplps</strong>: (double) specifies the maximum time (in seconds) to run MPLP preprocessing.        --jglp</strong>: (integer) specifies the maximum number of iterations to run JGLP preprocessing.        --jglps</strong>: (double) specifies the maximum time (in seconds) to run JGLP preprocessing.         Note that JGLP is always run with an i-bound equal to half of the i-bound used for mini-bucket.
