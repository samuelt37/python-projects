    Please,
fill out your student evaluations for CS-171.    

              ****
Every student who fills out a course evaluation for CS-171 will receive a bonus
of 1% added to their final grade, free and clear, off the curve, simply a
bonus.    EEE will return to me the
names of students who fill out evaluations (but not the content, which remains
anonymous), provided that enough students fill out evaluations so that
anonymity is not compromised.    I
will add 1% free bonus to the final grade of each such named student. ****    

              These
evaluations are important to UCI in monitoring our quality and success in
fulfilling our educational mission, and they are important to me in improving
the CS-171 experience.    

              Knowing
what positive features you found good and strong helps me know what to repeat
and emphasize.    Many of the positive
features in the current offering of CS-171 were suggested as improvements by
previous year's students.    

              Please,
fill out your student evaluations for CS-171.

    According
to the UCI Registrar quarter calendar website ( http://www.reg.uci.edu/calendars/quarterly/2014-2015/quarterly14-15.html ),
“Instruction ends” occurred yesterday, Fri., Dec 12. Consequently,
no discussion sections will occur Monday or Tuesday of next week (Dec. 15 or 16).
Instead, please schedule an office  hours  appointment
with your TA or me by email.

    Please
note that  P( A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B).    

  If,
and only if, A and B are independent, then and only then  P( A
and B) = P(A)*P(B).    

  If
A and B are disjoint then  P( A and B) = 0.    

  If
A and B are synonyms (i.e., co-occur exactly) then P(A and B) = P(A) = P(B).

    The
following seminar will be of interest to students interested in machine
learning:    

  “Never-Ending
Language Learning” --- the AI/ML seminar in Bren Hall 4011 from 3 to 4pm.

   ABSTRACT:    We will never really understand the process
of learning from experience, until we can build machines that learn many
different things, over years, and become better learners over time.    

  We
describe our research to build a Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL) that runs
24 hours per day, forever, learning to read the web.    Each day NELL extracts (reads) more
facts from the web, into its growing knowledge base of beliefs.    Each day NELL also learns to read better
than the day before.    NELL has been
running 24 hours/day for over four years now. The result so far is a collection
of 70 million interconnected beliefs (e.g.,  servedWtih (coffee,
 applePie )), NELL is considering at different levels
of confidence, along with millions of learned phrasings, morphological
features, and web page structures that NELL uses to extract beliefs from the
web. NELL is also learning to reason over its extracted knowledge, and to
automatically extend its ontology. Track NELL's progress at
http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu, or follow it on Twitter at @CMUNELL.    

   BIO:    Tom M. Mitchell founded and chairs
the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is the
E.  Fredkin  University Professor.    His research uses machine learning to
develop computers that are learning to read the web, and uses brain imaging to
study how the human brain understands what it reads.    Mitchell is a member of the U.S.
National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a Fellow and Past President of the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).    He believes the field of machine
learning will be the fastest growing branch of computer science during the 21st
century.

    The
Quiz #3 key has been posted below, and also is available  here .    

   v  
    Mid-term
exams will be passed out at the end of class Tues., Nov. 25, for those students
who have not yet gotten them. Otherwise, you may get them from  Sridevi , the Reader, during her office hours Wednesday
4:00-5:00pm, or anytime by appointment, in DBH-3221. The deadline for the
Mid-term Pedagogical Device is the beginning of class, Tuesday, 2 Dec. See
instructions on the new page 2 of the Exam key posted below.    

   v  
    Dr.
Lathrop’s office hours for  Weds.,  26 Nov., are
canceled due to a death in the family.    

   v  
    As
announced in lecture and on the class mailing list, the Mid-term Exam is now a
designated Pedagogical Device.    You
can receive 50% of your missed points back by repairing the bugs in your
knowledge base that led you to miss points. The deadline for the Mid-term Pedagogical
Device has been extended to the beginning of class, Tuesday, 2 Dec. See
instructions on the new page 2 of the Exam key posted below.    

   v  
    The
Reader,  Sridevi , kindly has provided a break-down of
the fraction of students who got zero, partial, or perfect credit on each
question of the Mid-term Exam and Quiz #2. Quiz #1 will follow.    I have inserted this analysis as the new
page 1 of those keys posted below.    

   v  
    The
Mid-term Exam key has been posted below, and also is available  here .    

   v  
    As
a suggestion, please arrive a few minutes early for the Mid-term Exam, spread
out, and take your seat quickly. Doing so will allow us to pass out the exam
quickly and give you the most possible time to work the exam.    

   v  
    If
you drew a line across branch arcs instead of crossing out leaf nodes for Quiz
#2, problem #2, your answer will be considered correct if the inferred leaf
nodes to be pruned are correct. Please check your quiz if so, and ask the
Reader about any problems.    But,
next time, please cross out the leaf nodes; it is faster and more accurate to
grade.    

   v  
    A
kind and helpful student has brought it to my attention that the PDF reader on
a Mac (iPad) sometimes has difficulty reading the previous CS-171 tests
correctly. For example, in Quiz #2 from SQ’2004, problems #3a and #3b,
the erroneous “Y” on the key was corrected by an overlay in the PDF
file of a red X through the Y, and next to it a red N. However, this overlay is
invisible on a Mac (iPad), leading to incorrect understanding of the right
answer. Sometimes the Mac PDF software is incompatible with the PC PDF
software. If you are using a Mac to read the previous CS-171 test PDF files and
something looks wrong, please bring it to my attention and then look at it
again with a PC.

   v  
    Several
interested students have asked what AI-related courses beyond CS-171 might be
taught next quarter ( Winter’2015 ). Although the
schedule is still tentative and subject to change and revision, these courses
appear in the current tentative schedule:    

               COMPSCI 116.   Computational Photography and
Vision.  (Prof.  Ramanan )    

               COMPSCI 172B.   Neural Networks and Deep
Learning.  (Prof.  Baldi )    

               COMPSCI 175.   Project in Artificial
Intelligence.  (Prof. Smyth)    

               COMPSCI 178.   Machine Learning and
Data-Mining.  (Prof.  Ihler )    

   v  
    A
kind and helpful student has contributed a search strategy visualization tool,
which appears below in the Search material of Week 2 under “Interesting
search algorithm visualization web page” and is also available  here .    

   v  
    Some
students were unclear about the  Tabu  Search wrapper
and implementation, so I added a slide on that topic to the Local Search
lecture slides.    

   v  
    The
lecture of Tue., 25 Nov., Probability, Uncertainty, Bayesian Networks, will be
given by Robert Hasselbeck.    

   v  
    Coding
shells for Monster Sudoku (Chapter 6, Constraint Satisfaction) and Maze Path-finding
(Chapter 3, State Space Search) have been posted to the Project section below.
These shells are for students who are interested and want to have fun with the
class material, “just for fun on an optional ungraded basis.” I may
award Bonus Points to students who contribute bug fixes or otherwise improve
the projects.    

   v  
    Please
plan to attend the  ICS Faculty Panel on
Improving Your Grad School Application , Tuesday, 21 October, noon-12:50pm
in DBH-6011.    (If you have a time
conflict, note that the video will be posted on the ICS SAO website.)    Please review the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics chart on “ Earnings
and unemployment rates by educational attainment .”    

   v  
    Office
hours update: The Reader,  Sridevi   Maharaj ,
will hold office hours Wednesday 4:00-5:00pm, or anytime by appointment, in
DBH-3221. Rick Lathrop’s office hours have changed to Wednesday
2:00-3:00pm, or anytime by appointment, in DBH-4224.    

   v  
    A
“just for fun on an optional ungraded basis” coding shell for Game
AI (Adversarial search) has been posted below. I hope to get shells for Sudoku
(Constraint satisfaction) and maze path-finding (Heuristic search) posted
shortly. I have no people resources available to fix problems if they come up,
but I will give Bonus Points to motivated students who do so.    

   v  
    Accommodations
for missed quizzes or exams have been extended to include field maneuvers of
the US military or National Guard (I require a copy of your official orders).  

   v  
    The
lecture of  Thu.,  23 Oct., start Constraint
Satisfaction, will be given by Mahdi Tehrani. A lecture by Robert Hasselbeck
will be scheduled sometime later in the term.  

   v  
    If
you are an Exchange student, or for any other reason are not on the EEE class
mailing list, please let me know so that I can make other arrangements for you
to get class email.  

   v  
    Several
students have expressed an interest in doing one or more coding projects
“just for fun” on an optional ungraded basis, so the coding shells
will be posted shortly.

    Goal:      

  The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic
principles of artificial intelligence. You will l  earn  some
 basic AI techniques, the problems for which they are applicable, and
their limitations.    

  The
course content is organized roughly around what are often considered to be
three central pillars of AI: Search, Logic, and Learning. Topics covered
include basic search, heuristic search, game search, constraint satisfaction,
knowledge representation, logic and inference, probabilistic modeling, and machine
learning algorithms.     

 

  

    Class Setup:      

  The
course will be primarily lecture-based.  
 There will be a Mid-term and a Final Exam.    On every second Tuesday, the first 20
minutes will be an in-class pop quiz, followed by lecture.    The frequent quizzes are intended to
encourage you to stay current with the course material.    All exams and quizzes may cover all
material presented in class, including lectures and assigned textbook
reading.    Quizzes will cover mostly
material presented since the last quiz, and also may include questions that
many students missed on the previous quiz.  
 The Final Exam will cover mostly material since the Mid-term Exam, and
also will include some questions intended to encourage you to remember the
earlier material.    

  Normally
I require an AI coding project, but this quarter there are 190 enrolled
students and I have been assigned only one Reader, so it is not logistically
feasible.    If any students are
interested in doing an AI coding project “just for fun” then I will
make the coding project shells available (you have to write the
“smarts” that goes into the shell).    I have shells for constraint
satisfaction (Sudoku), game playing/adversarial search (Connect-K), and
heuristic search (path finding in a maze). All these shells were written by
former CS-171 students who became interested in AI and signed up for CS-199 in
order to pursue their interest and write interesting AI project shells.    Please let me know if this is of
interest to you (CS-171 grade of A- or better required).    

  Homework
will be assigned, but is not graded. The reason is that prior student course
evaluations alerted me to the existence of student cheating by way of copying
the homework answers.    I deplore
this degree of personal degradation in dishonest students, but I cannot control
it, and so I avoid the opportunity.  
 I remain determined to create a fair and honest educational experience
for all students, as best I can.    

  

   

    Textbook      

  Required:    
 Russell &amp;   Norvig    :  Artificial Intelligence; A Modern Approach, 3 rd 
edition.    

  The
course is based on, and the UCI bookstore has, the 3 rd  edition. The
assigned textbook reading is required, and is fair game for quizzes and
exams.       You place
yourself at a distinct disadvantage if you do not have the textbook.        I expect that you have a personal copy
of the textbook, and quizzes and exams are written accordingly.       

  Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook for the quarter (and then resell it
back to the UCI Bookstore at the end if you don't want it for reference). 
  Please do not
jeopardize your precious educational experience with the false economy of
trying to save a few dollars by not having a personal copy of the textbook.       

  Also, for
your convenience, I have requested that a copy of the textbook be placed on
reserve in the UCI Science Library.    There is a two-hour check-out limit.  </strong>However,
please understand that with high student enrollments, it is unrealistic to
expect that these thin reserves will always be available when you need
them.    Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook.       </strong> 

   I do deplore the high cost of textbooks.    You are likely to find the book cheaper
if you search online at EBay.com, Amazon.com, and related sites.   </strong> 

   A
student kindly contributed link(s) to a PDF of the course textbook, for which I
cannot vouch:   </strong>

   A
student kindly contributed the following suggestion, for which I cannot vouch: </strong>     </strong> 

  Hello,  
I just wanted to point out that there does  exist  an
international edition of the book which can be bought for around $40-50. I
cannot comment on what specific differences there are for this particular book,
though they are usually very small (exercises moved around,  etc ).
Obviously, it is in paperback.                 http://www.valorebooks.com/affiliate/buy/siteID=e79mzf/ISBN=0136042597 
                http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=4161131466&amp;cm_ven=sws&amp;cm_cat=sws&amp;cm_pla=sws&amp;cm_ite=4161131466&amp;afn_sr=para&amp;para_l=1 
                http://www.biblio.com/books/360025589.html 
 
Personally I plan on using this book for a while so I bought the hardcover
version, but I just wanted to point out that this is an option for those
looking for a more 'economical' route.

    Grading:      

  Your
grade will be based on the bi-weekly   quizzes
(30%), a mid-term exam (35%), and a final exam (35%).      Homework is assigned but ungraded.    

   ·        
    Quizzes will be given the first 20 minutes of class on the
dates listed in the syllabus below.  
 Your lowest quiz score will be discarded in computing your grade.    It is not possible to make-up missed quizzes,
but one missed quiz may be discarded as your lowest quiz score.    

   ·        
    The mid-term exam will be given in class on Thursday,
November 13, and is closed-book, closed-notes.    It is not possible to make-up a missed
mid-term exam.    

   ·        
    The final exam will be given on Tuesday, December 16,
7:00-9:00 p.m., and is closed-book, closed-notes.    The final exam will cover all course
material from the entire quarter, but mostly the second half.    It is not possible to make-up a missed
final exam.    

                Dates
and times for all final exams are set by the UCI Registrar ( Final Exam
Schedule 2013-14 ).    

  I make exceptions for genuine medical conditions (I require
a note from your doctor on official letterhead), deaths in the family (I
require a copy of the death certificate), or field maneuvers of the US military
or National Guard (I require a copy of your official orders).    Also, I honor all requests made by the
UCI Disability Services Center.    

   ·        
    Every student who fills out a course evaluation
for CS-171 will receive a bonus of 1% added to their final grade, free and
clear, off the curve, simply a bonus.      

            EEE will
return to me the names of students who fill out evaluations (but not the
content, which remains anonymous), provided that enough students fill out
evaluations so that anonymity is not compromised.    I will add 1% free bonus to the final
grade of each such named student.  

            Student
course evaluations are very important to me for monitoring and improving the
course content, and very important to UCI for evaluating our success at our
educational mission.    *Please* fill
out your student course evaluations.    

       

   ·        
    “Bonus Points” will be awarded, at my sole
discretion, (1) to the first student who spots a genuine technical error (typos
don’t count) in any of the course materials before I spot it too, and (2)
for helpful contributions to the class as we go along.    One bonus point is equivalent to one
quiz point.    

       

                Your
Bonus Points, if any, should be visible to you in EEE  GradeBook .
If for some reason you have been awarded a Bonus Point, but you did not get a
notification from me or it did not appear in EEE  GradeBook ,
please do not hesitate in emailing me as a reminder just to avoid an unlikely
error.

comments, “One thing to possibly discuss with the last slide is that the
itinerary it settles on does stay at a higher energy for a little bit until it
passes closest to Europa, maximizing the velocity before the insertion sequence
to the lower energy.    This is indeed
optimal behavior, as opposed to immediately reducing its energy as a Greedy
Best First algorithm using this heuristic would want to do.”

    Projects:        

    Connect-K Game.       
 This project corresponds to Game Search (Chapter 5 in your book). Your
job is to write an AI agent that can beat you at Connect-K, i.e., to write the
adversarial search (game search) controller for a video game world. Shells will
be available in C++ and Java.    I
expect to be able to run a tournament within which your AI controllers will
compete against each other for Bonus Points. Everyone’s AI will be
entered in the tournament automatically; the bonus points are simply free,
based on how many games your AI wins against other AIs.        

         

   The Project Report template
is available here [ Word ;  PDF ].     

         

   An  example
dumb game is available ; an  example
smart game is available ; a  Project Specification
is available ; a Report Template is available [ Word ;  PDF ]; a
collection of  student coding
resources is available .      

         

   The coding resources
include:     

   (1) A Java shell.     

   (2) A C++ shell.     

   (3) A tournament shell,
which will let you play different versions of your AI against themselves to
refine your evaluation function.     

   (4) Three example AIs,
which you or your AI can play against: a good AI, an average AI, and a poor AI.     

   (5) The “ DummyAI ” source code, which your cleverness and
ingenuity will make smart.     

   (6) Several readme*.txt
files: readme.txt, readme-cPlusPlus.txt,  readme -tournament.txt.     

   (7)  ConnectK 
hints, caveats, and heuristics.     

   (8) A changelog.txt.     

         

   Note: We'll run the
tournament on SGE or a lab machine. The C++ target platform should be x86. You
should write your code to run on any x86  machine . The
OS is CentOS 6. We most likely will need to compile your code with CentOS 6
(RHEL 6) x86_64. Machines in the openlab.ics.uci.edu (family-guy.ics.uci.edu)
are CentOS 6.     

         

   Several of my various
CS-171 projects were written by former CS-171 students who became interested in
AI and signed up for CS-199 in order to pursue their interest and write
interesting AI project shells.  
 Please let me know if this is of interest to you (CS-171 grade of A- or
better required).

    Sudoku:       This project corresponds      to Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(Chapter 6 in your book). Your job is to write an AI agent that can solve
“Monster Sudoku” better than you can.       

         

   Standard Sudoku is
played on a 9x9 grid subdivided into nine 3x3 boxes. Every row, column, and box
must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. Monster (or Mega) Sudoku is
similar, but the grid and boxes are bigger. 12x12 puzzles are played with the
numbers 1 to 12 (or 1 to 9 and A, B, and C) in each row, column, and 3x4 box.
16x16 puzzles are played with 1 to 16 (or 1 to 9 and the letters A to G) in
each row, column, and 4x4 box. In general,  NxN 
puzzles are played with the numbers 1 to N (or 1 to 9 and the letters A to Z)
and  pxq  boxes, where N =   pq  . Sometimes zero is added to the digits. The Sudoku
community has developed many clever variants and encodings based on this
general idea.     

         

    See for example:      

     http://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/archive.shtml?type=monster       

     http://www.universaluclick.com/games/sudokumonster       

     http://www.knightfeatures.com/KFWeb/content/features/kffeatures/puzzlesandcrosswords/KF/Sudoku/Sudoku_Monster/sudoku_monster.html       

     http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/sudoku/mega       

     or        just do a Web search for      Monster (or Mega) Sudoku.           

           

    A previous offering of CS-171 coded a
Sudoku solver using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) methods we will
study, but the methods proved to be too powerful for Sudoku and even the basic
methods could solve hard Sudoku puzzles easily.    I hope Monster Sudoku will provide more
of a challenge.      

       

   The coding resources
include:      

   (1)  A Java shell 
(I do not yet have a shell in any other language; but would like to).     

   (2)  A Project
Specification.      

   (3)  Shell
documentation  (incomplete).     

         

   A former CS-171 student
wrote the shell in Spring Quarter, 2014, so it has not yet been tested
“in action.” I will give Bonus Points to students who find and fix
bugs. He ran out of time in the quarter before he finished the documentation. I
will give Bonus Points to students who improve the documentation.     

         

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

   Maze
Solver:      
 This project corresponds to Informed Search Problems (Chapter 3 in your
book). Your job is to write an AI agent that can find paths through a maze better
than you can.   

         

   You are employed by a company that
makes interactive video games. The game's 2D world has a large number of fixed
polygonal obstacles of various shapes and sizes on the screen. You are assigned
to write the controller for one of the moving figures on the screen. Whenever a
gold coin appears on the screen, your figure is to walk to the coin as rapidly
as possible, avoiding all obstacles. Input is the screen locations of your
figure, the gold coin, and the locations and shapes of all obstacles. Output is
to be the path your figure will follow to the coin. [ Click
here for solved examples. ]     

         

   This is the same basic problem as
robot navigation through a crowded workspace without colliding with any objects
in the workspace. In general, this problem is representative of a whole class
of related planning and navigation problems.     

         

   Demonstrate, benchmark, and compare
Breadth-First, Depth-First, Uniform Cost, Bidirectional (using Uniform-Cost),
Iterative Deepening, Greedy Best First, and A* search on this route-finding
problem.     

         

   The coding resources include:     

   (1)  A Java shell .     

   (2)  A C++ shell .     

   (3)  An example game .     

   (4)  Examples
of maze agents in mazes .     

   (5) Test mazes (to appear soon).    I will give Bonus Points to students who
contribute difficult mazes (should be harder than the mazes here).     

         

   It is easy to prove to yourself that
the shortest path through a maze must be a sequence of straight line segments
from polygon corner to polygon corner (apply the Triangle Inequality). The
shell is set up to facilitate finding such a solution.     

         

   Clever students have discovered that
the  isVisible  function is buggy, in the sense that it
is only correct for polygon corners, and sometimes allows a search path to
“tunnel through” a polygon if a candidate point is placed in the
interior of a polygon ( example 1 ;  example 2 ).    Such paths are not considered valid
solutions.    I will give Bonus Points
to students who find and fix such bugs (must be an efficient bug fix, i.e., not
slow things down too much).

  As an
incentive to study this material, at least one question from a previous Quiz or
Exam will appear on every new Quiz or Exam. In particular, questions that many
students missed are likely to appear again. If you missed a question, please
study it carefully and learn from your mistake --- so that if it appears again,
you will understand it perfectly.     

       

  Also, a
student has recommended ‘quizlet.com’ as a good online study
resource. While I cannot vouch for it, apparently it contains several good
study aids for your textbook.

    Academic Honesty:         

   Academic dishonesty is unacceptable
and will not be tolerated at the University of California, Irvine. It is the
responsibility of each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic
honesty policies. Please take the time to read the current  UCI
Senate Academic Honesty Policies  and the  ICS
School Policy on Academic Honesty .   

   The
policies in these documents will be adhered to scrupulously. Any student who
engages in cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, or collusion in
dishonest activities, will receive an academic evaluation of ``F'' for the
entire course, with a letter of explanation to the student's permanent file.
The  ICS Student Affairs
Office  will be involved at every step of the process. Dr. Lathrop seeks to
create a level playing field for all students.
