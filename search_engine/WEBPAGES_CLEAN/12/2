            Single-Precision Dot Products in Matlab    
        
           
               I was running some Matlab functions for stochastic gradient descent SVD, and I was surprised to find that while my code worked perfectly in the Windows environment, it was giving incorrect results when I ran it on the Linux machines.   After some debugging, I found out that the dot product calculation on single-precision vectors is the source of the problem:  &gt;&gt; a = [1 2 3]; &gt;&gt; b = [3 4 5]; &gt;&gt; a * b'  ans =  26  &gt;&gt; single(a) * single(b)'  ans =  1.0737e+09   One way to get around this is to just convert the single-precision vectors into double-precision.  It's probably better to just use the "dot" function instead:   &gt;&gt; dot(single(a),single(b))  ans =  26    This was a pretty subtle bug!
