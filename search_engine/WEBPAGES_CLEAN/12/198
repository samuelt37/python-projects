 Fault Containment (just beginning)<body>

  Fault Containment (just beginning)  
      Develop an Architectural Framework for Fault Containment
 
  Simple software, synthesis, and hardware fault models
  Exploit Process Isolation and Validation mechanisms for fast-fail
  Design hardware and software structures which enable containment and reconfiguration
  Controlled synthesis and hardware mapping
  Synthesis of Hardware structures which provide modularization
