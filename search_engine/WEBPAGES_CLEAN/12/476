We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.
