&gt;Certainly the document itself could carry information
&gt;along with it, in a META tag or on any tag that we can
&gt;legitimately propose. This would allow arbitrary 
&gt;authoring tools to have access to whatever information
&gt;the RCS provides -- without having to inspect any cookies
&gt;that might be associated with the document. I am including 
&gt;Notepad in my definition of arbitrary authoring tools.
&gt;For debugging purposes, I think that it will be useful
&gt;to carry info in the document. 

Sounds good, but do we ask that the versioning system be
able to place this information in PNG files and Word
documents as well as HTML files?  It might be more
consistent to have this information available for all
media types through a browser query.

Embedding the checkout info in the document does have
the great benefit that any authoring tool (not just the
original) could be used to check it back in.
