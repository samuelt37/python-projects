 E. Bozorgzadeh ,
and D. Eppstein.  IEEE Trans. CAD  26 (10): 1803–1817, 2007.
 
We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.
  
    Graph-theoretic solutions to computational geometry problems . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk  at the 35th International
Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2009),
Montpellier, France, 2009. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5911, 2009, pp. 1–16.  arXiv:0908.3916 .
 
We survey problems in computational geometry that may be solved by
constructing an auxiliary graph from the problem and solving a
graph-theoretic problem on the auxiliary graph. The problems considered
include the art gallery problem, partitioning into rectangles, minimum
diameter clustering, bend minimization in cartogram construction, mesh
stripification, optimal angular resolution, and metric embedding.

Shows both theoretically and experimentally that the number of times a
random line crosses a road network is asymptotically upper bounded by
the square root of the number of road segments.
  
    Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1870 .  21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms , Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.
 
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n ε -approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n 1 − ε  for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

    Windows into relational events: data structures for contiguous
subsequences of edges .  M. J. Bannister ,
 C. DuBois ,
D. Eppstein, and
 P. Smyth .  NIPS 2012 Workshop on Algorithmic and Statistical Approaches for Large
Social Networks , South Lake Tahoe, California, 2012 (poster and invited talk).   24th ACM-SIAM
Symp. Discrete Algorithms , New Orleans, Louisiana, 2013,
pp. 856–864.   arXiv:1209.5791 .
 
We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a
social network have a sequence of pairwise interactions. Contiguous
subsequences of these interactions form graphs, and we develop efficient
data structures for querying the parameters of these graphs.

    ERGMs are hard .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1412.1787 .  
ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.
  
    Metric dimension parameterized by max leaf number . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1506.01749 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  19 (1): 313–323, 2015 .
 
We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.
  
    The computational hardness of  d K-series .  W. E. Devanny ,
D. Eppstein, and
B. Tilman.  NetSci2016  poster session, Seoul, Korea.
 
The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
 d -dimensional tensor, describing the number of  d -tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any  d  ≥ 3, or for  d  = 2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).

M. Torres.  arXiv:1605.09425 .  Proc. 19th Information Security Conference (ISC 2016) , Honolulu,
Hawaii.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  9866 (2016), pp. 283–301 .
 
We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.
