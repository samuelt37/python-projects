 Prefetching for Latency &amp; BW Management<body>

  Prefetching for Latency &amp; BW Management  
      Combat latency deterioration
 
  optimal prefetching: 
  �memory side pointer chasing�
    blocking mechanisms
  fast barrier, broadcast support
  synchronization support
       Bandwidth management
 
  memory (re)organization to suit application characteristics
  translate and gather hardware
  �prefetching with compaction�
