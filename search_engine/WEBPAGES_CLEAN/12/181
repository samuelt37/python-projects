  Presented by Darren StrashUC Irvine 


   

Consider the following one-dimensional range reporting problem: given an array A
of n elements, report the k smallest elements in the subarray A[i..j] in sorted order.
We present a data structure in the RAM model that supports such queries in O(k)
time, using O(n) words of memory, and O(n log n) preprocessing time. We also
discuss how to extend this result to the online version of the problem.
