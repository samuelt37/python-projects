  Replicators : B01357/S0123 

  
B01357/S0123  has a period-six 2c/3 replicator, consisting of a
block of two cells: 

     

 Three parallel tracks of these replicators can interact to form
an 8c/24 spaceship: 

     

 More curiously, three perpendicular tracks can also form a
spaceship, again moving at speed c/3 but with period 12. The
replicators from the middle track stop the backwards replication of
the other two tracks, destroying themselves in the process, but are
reformed from the resulting debris. 

     

 With random initial conditions, this rule fills space with a chaotic
pattern of interacting replicators. If the initial density of live cells
is approximately 48%, the pattern also features large regions of
opposite phases (live replicators on dead backgrounds in even
generations, or vice versa) with slowly annealing region boundaries.
For densities away from this critical value, one phase or the other eventually takes over the
whole space.
