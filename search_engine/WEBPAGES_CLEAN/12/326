                    Confocal laser scanning microscope setup dedicated to plant developmental imaging in the Meyerowitz
                    laboratory at Caltech, immediately after installation (photo taken 4/26/04). This is a centerpiece and a
                    major investment of the FIBR Computable Plant project and is now producing useful imagery.
