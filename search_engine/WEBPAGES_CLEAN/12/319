   Steinitz theorems for orthogonal polyhedra . 
D. Eppstein and
E. Mumford.  arXiv:0912.0537 .  26th Eur. Worksh. Comp. Geom. , Dortmund, Germany, 2010.   26th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Snowbird, Utah, 2010, pp. 429–438 .   J. Computational Geometry  5 (1): 179–244, 2014 .
 
We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.
  
The journal version has the slightly different title "Steinitz theorems
for simple orthogonal polyhedra".
