The complement of a
 minimum spanning tree  is a maximum spanning tree in
the dual graph.  By applying this fact we can use a modified form of
Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to update the MST in
logarithmic time per update.

Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the  rotating caliper
graph  of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

    Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems .

Algorithms and Applications  3 (3): 1–27, 1999. 
 
Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, " Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families ", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

Baltimore, 2003, pp. 599–608 .
 
We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006 .
 
We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 
  
The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

    Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0307023 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

    All maximal independent sets and dynamic dominance for sparse

Vancouver, 2005, pp. 451–459.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(4):A38, 2009 .
 
We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets
in bounded-degree graphs in constant time per set, in graphs from minor
closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for

the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster

O(n 2 ), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the

bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.
  
    Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1870 .  21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms , Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.
 
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n ε -approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n 1 − ε  for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.
