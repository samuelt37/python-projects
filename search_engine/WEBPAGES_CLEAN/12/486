  And the Bad Part�  
        All these extensions had to be part of the base protocol

 

      Have blurred the (already implicit) line between base protocol and extensions in HTTP

         Cost has been a very complex protocol

 

      HTTP/1.1 has been under way a long time

  Not just result of complex extensions but how they interact

  Adding new features gets harder and harder

         Reason: No way of replacing existing features

 

      Cost of backwards compatibility keeps increasing

  Will never be able to replace existing features
