oeofstream()
oeofstream(int fd)
oeofstream(const char        *filename)
oeofstream(const std::string &amp;filename)
    
Creates a new oeofstream. If a valid file descriptor ( fd ) is passed to
the constructor, the stream will use the associated data target for output.
Otherwise, the constructors expect the name of file to be written to. If the
named file does not exist, it will be created. If no parameter is passed to the
constructor, the stream can later be opened using the  open  command
defined in  OEPlatform::oeostream  or the  openfd  command defined
in this class.
