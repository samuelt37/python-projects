A  correspondence 
 f  between
 X  and  Y 
is a triple ( X , Y , Γ )
where  Γ  is a subset of the Cartesian product
 X × Y . 
 
  
    The  pre-domain  of  f 
    is  X .
   
   
    The  co-domain  of  f 
    is  Y .
   
   
     Γ  is the  graph  of  f . 
    (Note that  Γ  is a binary  relation .) 
   
   
    The  domain  of  f 
    (written  Dom ( f ))
    is
    {  x  ∈  X  |
    ∃ y  ∈  Y 
    ( ( x , y ) ∈  Γ  ) }.
   
   
    The  range  of  f 
    (written  Im ( f ))  
    is
    {  y  ∈  Y  |
    ∃ x  ∈  X 
    ( ( x , y ) ∈  Γ  ) }.
   
   
     y  ∈  Y  is
    an  image  of
     x  ∈  X 
    if
    ( x ,y) ∈  Γ .
   
   
    The  image  of
     W  ⊆  X  is
    {  y  ∈  Y  |
    ∃ x  ∈  W 
    ( ( x , y ) ∈  Γ  ) }.
   
   
     x  ∈  X  is
    a  pre-image  of
     y  ∈  Y 
    if
    ( y ,x) ∈  Γ .
   
   
    The  pre-image  of
     V  ⊆  Y  is
    {  x  ∈  X  |
    ∃ y  ∈  V 
    ( ( x , y ) ∈  Γ  ) }.
   
   
    The  converse  of  f ,
    written  f  -1 
    is the correspondence whose graph is
    { ( y , x ) |
    ( x , y ) ∈  Γ  }
   
  
  

 
The graph of a correspondence is not constrained
in the number of edges into or out of each element: 
the image of a domain element can be empty,
a  singleton , or
larger,
 
as can the pre-image of a range element. 

 Functions 

 
A  function 
 f : X → Y 
is a correspondence ( X , Y , Γ )
that assigns at most one range element to each element of
its domain.
Equivalently,
the image of every element in the domain of  f 
is a singleton. 
 

 Mappings 

 
A  mapping  is a function
whose domain is its entire pre-domain.
 
 
A mapping
 f : X → Y 
is:
 
     onto  
       or
       
        surjective 
       
       if each
           y  ∈  Y 
          has
       
       at least
       
       one pre-image in  f 
       
      one-to-one 
       
        injective 
       
       at most
       
      one-to-one and onto 
       
        bijective 
       
       exactly
       
      The analogous concepts for binary  relations  

 
The pre-domain and co-domain are not relevant for a relation,,
since a relation is simply a set of tuples. 
 
 
A relation
 r 
that is a subset of  X × Y 
is:
 
     functional 
       
       if each
           x  ∈  X 
          maps to
       
       at most one
       
       
           y  ∈  Y 
       
      injective 
       
       if each
           y  ∈  Y 
          is mapped to by
       
       
           x  ∈  X
