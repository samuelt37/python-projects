Hi folks, my name is Yaron Y. Goland and I am the program manager for
Internet Protocols at Internet Explorer. Just so my actions don't seem
completely out of left field I am also in charge of HTTP versioning and
file control extensions at Microsoft. Specifically, I am putting
together a doc listing our needs and proposed solutions. I hope to post
that doc to this group on Saturday or Sunday. From what I have read I
suspect our needs documents will match very closely. This project is
currently my #1 priority so expect to hear a lot from me as I try to
suck up all the knowledge this group has generated. =)

&gt;
&gt;This message contains my current understanding of the status of this
&gt;working group.
&gt;
&gt;I received an email yesterday from Larry Masinter, Chair of the HTTP
&gt;Working Group.  He stated that:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The deadline for 1.2 features was "two weeks after the Montreal
&gt;&gt;meeting", and then "August 1", but of course, the deadline has no
&gt;&gt;force, and new proposals can be entertained whenever. However, I'd
&gt;&gt;like to encourage you to go public sooner rather than wait until you
&gt;&gt;think you have it "right".
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you're not ready to circulate a specification of the actual
&gt;&gt;protocol changes, are you at least ready to circulate a specification
&gt;&gt;of the requirements that might lead to protocol changes?
&gt;
&gt;I feel it is very important for this group to inform the HTTP 1.2 effort on
&gt;the requirements for versioning on the WWW.  As a result, there is one
&gt;current action item:
&gt;
&gt;- Submit a document on requirements for the capabilities which should be
&gt;supported in versioning via HTTP.  Status: David Durand and Fabio Vitali
&gt;submitted to the list a draft requirements document.  David and I met today
&gt;to discuss this requirements document, the result of which a slightly
&gt;revised requirements document will be presented to this list early next
&gt;week, hopefully end-of-day Monday.  This document will be forwarded to the
&gt;HTTP WG at the end of next week, August 30.
&gt;
&gt;Following the generation of a requirements document, it makes sense to also:
&gt;
&gt;- Develop a document listing our proposal for implementing the capabilities
&gt;listed in the requirements document.  Whether these capabilities are
&gt;implemented in HTTP 1.2, or become an extension using PEP, it will be a
&gt;worthwhile exercise to develop this draft proposal.  My current
&gt;understanding of HTTP methods that might be proposed in this document are:
&gt;LOCK, UNLOCK, LINK, UNLINK, and possibly a FLAG method.  This document has
&gt;not yet been started.
