G. Woeginger .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  7 (1): 45–58, 1992 .
 
Uses dynamic programming to choose sets of  k 
points optimizing various criteria on the quality of their convex hull
(in particular area).  The time complexity (cubic in  n )
was later improved to quadratic in
my paper
" New algorithms for minimum area  k -gons ",
which however continues to use the same dynamic program as a subroutine.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

    Approximating the minimum weight Steiner triangulation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 91-55 , ICS, UCI, 1991.   3rd ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,  Orlando, 1992, pp. 48–57 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  11: 163–191, 1994 .
 
 Quadtree  based
 triangulation  gives a large but constant factor
 approximation 
to the minimum weight triangulation of a point set or
convex polygon, allowing extra Steiner points to be added as vertices.
Includes proofs of several bounds on triangulation weight relative to
the  minimum spanning tree  or non-Steiner
triangulation, and a conjecture
that for convex polygons the only points that need to be added are on
the polygon boundary.

    Iterated nearest neighbors and finding minimal polytopes .

Tech. Rep. 92-71, ICS, UCI, 1992.  
 4th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,  Austin, 1993, pp. 64–73 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  11: 321–350, 1994 .
 
Showed that for various optimization criteria, the
optimal polygon containing  k  of  n 
points must be near one of the points, hence one can transform
time bounds involving several factors of  n 
to bounds linear in  n  but polynomial in  k. 
Used as a subroutine are data structures for finding several
 nearest neighbors  in rectilinear metric spaces, and
algorithms for finding the
 deepest point in an arrangement  of cubes or
spheres.

Given a  d -dimensional set of  n  points,
the number of combinatorially different

    Dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees and extrema of binary functions . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-05 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Tech. Rep. 92-88 , ICS, UCI, 1992.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  13: 111–122, 1995 .
 
Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
 minimum spanning tree  can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt  n ) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

    Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-11 , ICS, UCI, 1995.   27th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing,  Las Vegas, 1995, pp. 662–671 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  20: 463–476, 1998 .
 
Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.

    On nearest-neighbor graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. S. Paterson ,
and F. F. Yao.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  17: 263–282, 1997 .
 
Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things
that any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter  D  has O( D  9 ) vertices.
This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists
of improving that bound to O( D  5 ), which is tight.

    Raising roofs, crashing cycles, and playing pool: applications of
a data structure for finding pairwise interactions .

 14th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Minneapolis, 1998, pp. 58–67 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  22 (4): 569–592, 1999 (special issue for SCG 1998).
 
We use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " to detect collisions among a collection of moving
objects in sublinear time per collision.  As one application, we can
construct the  straight skeleton  of Aichholzer et al (and the mitered
offset curves from which it is defined) in subquadratic time.

    Regression depth and center points .  N. Amenta ,

Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Brown Univ., 1998.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  23 (3): 305–323, 2000 .
 
We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
 regression depth  at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

    Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/9912013 .  
 16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  28 (1): 1–17, 2002.
 
We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".

    Ramified rectilinear polygons: coordinatization by dendrons .  H.-J. Bandelt ,
 V. Chepoi ,
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1005.1721 .   Disc. Comp. Geom. 
54 (4): 771–797, 2015 .  
We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L 1  plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.
  
    Drawing trees with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area .  C. Duncan ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 S. Kobourov , and
 M. Nöllenburg .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 183–194 .  arXiv:1009.0581 .   Discrete Comput. Geom.  49 (2): 157–182, 2013 .
 
We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.
  
    Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the
bounded faces have small dimension . 
D. Eppstein and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 27th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Paris, 2011, pp. 361–368.  arXiv:1103.2575 .   Discrete Comput. Geom.  50 (1): 1–21, 2013 .
 
Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .
    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar Lombardi drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
