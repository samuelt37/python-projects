     Bucket Elimination: A Unifying Framework for Probabilistic Inference 
 Rina Dechter ( dechter@ics.uci.edu ) 

      
  
 Abstract  
Probabilistic inference algorithms for finding the most probable explanation, the 
maximum aposteriori hypothesis, and the maximum expected utility and for updating belief
are reformulated as an elimination-type algorithm called bucket elimination. This 
emphasizes the principle common to many of the algorithms appearing in that literature
and clarifies their relationship to nonserial dynamic programming algorithms. We also
present a general way of combining conditioning and elimination within this framework.
Bounds on complexity are given for all the algorithms as a function of the problem's 
structure.
