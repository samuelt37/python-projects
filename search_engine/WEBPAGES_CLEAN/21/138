   Projects 
I contributed to the  RACSO online Judge , a collection of automatically-judged exercises for the subject «Theory of Computation», that is: exercises asking to define recognizers / generators of formal languages (regular or context-free), as well as exercises asking for reductions between problems (undecidable or NP-complete).
