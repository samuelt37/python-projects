virtual bool SweepConfs() = 0
    
Clean up unused memory and objects which may be associated with the
conformers of the  OEMCMolBaseT .  Renumber the conformer indices
sequentially.  This function invalidates the conformer indices of all
conformers in a molecule.  Note that this function doesn't guarantee that
all conformer indices are sequential upon completion (some molecule
implementations may treat  OEMolBase::Sweep  as a no-op).
