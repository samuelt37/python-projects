We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.
