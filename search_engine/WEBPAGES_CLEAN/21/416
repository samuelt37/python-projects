The code is implemented with Java. The demonstration 
code can be found here:  download
 SSEA .   Instruction of use  
	
 

Input files: ( Example input files can be found here:   example files .   

   
1) SNP genotype file
 
The first line contains the SNP ID and a list of phenotype of the subjects,Ca if the subject belongs to case(disease) group, Co if the subject belongs to control group.
  
Line format: SNP_ID(tab)(subject 1 phenotype)(tab)(subject 2 phenotype)(tab) ... (subject N phenotype)
  
Exampleï¼šSNPID Ca_1    Co_1    Co_2    Co_3    Ca_2	...
  
The remainder of the data file contains data for all SNPs. Rows corresponds to SNPs, columns corresponds to genotype(use 1,2,3 to represent 3 different genotypes AA, AB,BB; use 0 to represent the missing genotype data).
  
Example: rs12082473      1       0       1       1       3	...
  

2) SNP to Gene Mapping file (annotation file)
  
Example: SNPId Gene_Name
  

3) Pathway file(the gene sets used for testing were downloaded together with the original GSEA software from KEGG)
   
Example: Pathway_Name	annotation	Gene_Name1	Gene_Name2	Gene_Name3	...

3) Phenotype file(this can be obtain from the first line of SNP genotype file, look for example file for detail)
  

Output:
  
This package has two steps: it first use SNP genotype file and annotation file to generate Significant SNP files; together with pathway(SNPset) file would be used as an input for the second step. The 
final output file include the pathway name, pathway size, enrichment score and nominal p-value.
