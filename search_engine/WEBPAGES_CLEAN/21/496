   Course News 

 

 

  Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first). 

   Date Added

         Project #5  is now available. 
         The  Schedule  has been updated to reflect the rest of the quarter's lectures. 
         Missing  code examples  are now available. 
        
     Th 2/14 
      Project #4  is now available. 
     Th 2/14 
     Tuesday's  code example  showing how to call the bit.ly API from Java is now available. 
     Su 2/10 
     Thursday's  code example  detailing the use of dependency injection and how it enables unit testability is now available. 
     Th 2/7 
      Project #3  is now available. 
     Th 2/7 
     The peer design review for Project #3 has been rescheduled until Thursday, February 14. 
     W 2/6 
     The Git repository of  code examples  on design patterns, which we wrapped up in lecture yesterday, has been updated to include all of the examples through yesterday. 
     Tu 2/5 
     A  Schedule  update is now available. 
     M 2/4 
     The due date for  Project #2  has been extended to Wednesday, February 6, 11:59pm. 
     F 2/1 
     This week's  code examples  on the use of design patterns are now available. 
     Su 1/27 
     The  code example  we reviewed in lecture on Thursday — an implementation of the Assignment #1 user interface from last year's version of this course, which was nearly identical to the  Project #2  user interface from this quarter, except that it had additional commands — is now available as a Git repository.  You can clone the repository using either command-line tools or EGit, though you might find that EGit helps you to visualize the repository's history more easily than the command-line tools; Git is Git, though, so it's ultimately up to you. 
     Tu 1/22 
      Project #2  is now available. 
     Su 1/13 
      Project #1  is now available. 
     Tu 1/8 
     
       Welcome!  A few things: 
        The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, January 8.  For more information about meeting times, see the  Course Reference .  For information about lecture material and readings, see the  Schedule . 
         As I am making some adjustments to this course, relative to the last time I taught it, this course is a work in progress.  The web site will be updated along the way, with the goal behind to keep the  Schedule  estimated a week or two ahead, and remaining material released as needed.  As changes are made, they will be noted here on the news page. 
         Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the  Course Reference , the  Schedule , and the  Project Guide , as well as a set of commented  Code Examples  that will be posted during the course of the quarter.
