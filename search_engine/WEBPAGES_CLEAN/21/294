 CS 261, Fall 2011: Data Structures 

 This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
10:00 - 10:50 in MSTB 118. I will also have office hours Mondays and
Tuesdays from 2:00 - 3:00 in my office, Bren 4214. Coursework will
consist of weekly homeworks,
one midterm and a comprehensive final exam. Grading will be based 20% on
homework, 35% for the midterm, and 45% for the final.
The reader assigned to the course is Leila Jalali
. 

 There is no
required textbook; however, much of the course material will be drawn
from the Wikipedia articles collected together in
the Wikipedia "book"
  Fundamental Data Structures  .
Additionally, suggested internet readings for the
topics covered here will be linked from the schedule of topics. 

 This course may be used as part of the comprehensive exam in the
  computer science masters program. To pass the comprehensive exam,
  students must score at least 66% of the possible points on the final
  examination for the course. Students who wish to take the
  comprehensive exam but are not enrolled in the
  course should contact me by email before the end of week 8 of the
  quarter to reserve a place in the exam.
