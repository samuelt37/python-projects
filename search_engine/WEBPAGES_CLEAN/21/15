 ICS 161, Design and Analysis of Algorithms 
Winter 1996 Lecture Notes 


  The following lecture notes describe topics from the Winter 1996
offering of ICS 161.  They are placed here in the hope that they will
remain helpful for future 161 students, however there is no guarantee
that they cover the same material as current 161 offerings.
