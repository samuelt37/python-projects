  Opportunity: Application-Adaptive Architectures  
      Exploit architectural �low-hanging� fruits
 
  performance variation across applications (10-100X)
  performance variation across data-sets (10X)
       Use interconnect and data-path reconfiguration to
 
  increase performance
  combat performance fragility and 
  improve fault tolerance
       Configurable hardware is used to improve utilization of performance critical resources
 
  instead of using configurable hardware to build additional resources
  design goal is to achieve peak performance across applications
  configurable hardware leveraged in efficient utilization of performance critical resources
