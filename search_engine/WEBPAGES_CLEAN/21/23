 Student life 

 
 

 There is more to life as a Bren School student than lectures and labs:  
   Work out at the Anteater Recreation Center  
  Catch a concert at the  Bren Events Center  
  Cheer on one of UCI's 23 Division I  athletic teams  
  Or engage in a plethora of other  exciting social activities  
  In addition to offering you many opportunities for student involvement, the campus provides a  range of services  designed to help students achieve academic progress and success even when problems or difficulties arise.  







 Join a Student Group  
 In addition to the plethora of  UCI student groups ,  the Bren School sponsors a number of student groups, listed below, that you may join that address  specific interests in the field of information and computer sciences.  
   ACM</strong>, Student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery 
		  The Association for Computing Machinery is the world's largest society of information technology students and professionals. The chapter represents the needs of the UCI computing community. 
     INSA</strong>, Informatics Student Association 
          Works to unite the Informatics community at UCI and to promote the  Informatics major  to students and companies alike. We offer workshops, corporate visits and tours, individual tutoring and mentoring, tournaments and competitions and networking/recruiting events with technology companies. 
            
           
  UCF , Undergraduate Computing Federation 
          Promotes interaction between and provide resources to students with an interest in Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, Network Security, Cryptography, or Ethical Hacking. Open to all UCI undergraduate or graduate students. 
   WICS , Women in Computer Sciences 
           By joining WICS, female students can surround themselves with their peers and positive influences who, not only work with and can assist them with their classes and curriculum, but can also help them network with other successful women, giving them even more opportunities to succeed. 
  Live in the Bren School Theme House  
  The school sponsors a theme house in the  Arroyo Vista housing community , which is in walking distance of the  Anteater Recreation Center . 
 The theme house provides informal, academic and social functions for students interested in the field of information and computer science.  
 The goals of this house are to expose residents to faculty, alumni and businesspersons in the information and computer sciences field. 
 Activities include visits to corporations, opportunities to participate in symposiums and workshops centering on academic success, community and career opportunities, preparation for graduate/professional schools and learning skills.  
 The house is open to all students with an interest in information and computer sciences.
