                Internships are a key element of your preparation for entering the workforce.  They provide you with valuable project experience in the real world, give you a chance to taste what your future career might be like, and help build your resume.  The majority of Bren School juniors and seniors spend their summer at an internship, and it is not uncommon for our sophomore and even freshmen students to also do so.
                 
                 
                Given the high-tech environment surrounding UC Irvine, numerous local internships are available, though quite a few of our students venture out to other parts of the country to pursue their interests.
