Designing an Effective Link        1.1  
Be sure that all links indicate that they are links             
   underlining, buttons, items in colums, textual hints, 
mouse rollover,            changing 
cursor icon, and semantics             
    1.2  Work to ensure that users 
will view and notice links               
    Put important links above scroll lines; entice 
users to scroll past scroll lines        1.3  
Be sure that all links clearly indicate their destinations               Text 
links, explanatory text, mouse rollover        2.  
Managing large number of links        2.1  
Plan effective ratios of breadth and depth in Web site hierarchies   
            Breadth 
over depth, grouping          
    2.2  Supplement the primary 
links of a Web site with secondary links,         
when appropriate          
           2.3  Allow branches of a hierarchy 
to converge whenappropriate            
          2.4  Design the interface to readily 
reveal the underlying information structure          
          3.  Providing 
orientation information        3.1  
Provide clear, brief, and highly conspicuous orientation information on the home   
          
page.    What is this site about?                    
     
    ("Splash" pages are o.k. if you can click them 
away).      3.2  Provide 
orientation information on lower-level pages to support continued   
          
exploration of your Web site.
