    However, software development is �uniquely complex�  The field is young and there is little consensus and few standards  Software is irregular, intangible, invisible  Software is malleable -- we can modify the product itself  Software construction is human-intensive  Software application horizons expand with hardware capabilities  Software problems are unprecedentedly complex  Software solutions require unusual rigor  Software has discontinuous operational nature  No two parts or two systems are alike  Scaling up the system causes a nonlinear increase in complexity
