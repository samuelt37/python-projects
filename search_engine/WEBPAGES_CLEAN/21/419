  Wikiquette - how do I behave correctly? 
     
  Cooperative Editing 
     Basic principle:  Anybody logged in can edit anything.        Exceptions:       If you want to edit a page without being disturbed, just write a note to that effect  at the top  of the page and save that change first.      If two people edit a page simultaneously, the first can save normally, but the second will get a warning and should follow the directions to merge their changes with the already saved data.     Personal Homepages: normally only changed by their owner, but you may append messages at the end of the page        In general, do follow any hints given on a page, there is generally no  enforced  limit, but you should not blindly ignore other people's wishes.
