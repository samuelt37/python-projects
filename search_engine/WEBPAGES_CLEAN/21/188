     Mini-Bucket Heuristics for Improved Search

 Abstract  
The paper is a second in a series of two papers evaluating the power of a new scheme
that generates search heuristics mechanically. The heuristics are extracted from an approximation 
scheme called mini-bucket elimination that was recently introduced. The first paper introduced the 
idea and evaluated it within Branch-and-Bound search. In the current paper the idea is further 
extended and evaluated within Best-First search. The resulting algorithms are compared on coding
and medical diagnosis problems, using varying strength of the mini-bucket heuristics.
 
Our results demonstrate an effective search scheme that permits controlled tradeoff between 
preprocessing (for heuristic generation) and search. Best-first search is shown to outperform 
Branch-and-Bound, when supplied with good heuristics, and sufficient memory space.
