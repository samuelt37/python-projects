 Closest Pair Applications<body>
  Closest Pair Data Structures :
Applications 

The following algorithms and applications can be implemented efficiently
using our new closest pair data structures, or involve closest pair
computation as important subroutines.

  Dynamic minimum spanning trees
  Two-optimization heuristics in combinatorial optimization
   Straight skeletons and roof design 
   Ray-intersection diagram 
  Other collision detection applications
  Hierarchical clustering
  Traveling salesman heuristics
  Greedy matching
  Constructive induction
  Gr√∂bner bases
