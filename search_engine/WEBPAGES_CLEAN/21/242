        Join-Graph Propagation Algorithms    
        Robert Mateescu, Kalev Kask, Vibhav Gogate, and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   

The paper investigates parameterized approximate message-passing schemes that are based on
bounded inference and are inspired by Pearlâ€™s belief propagation algorithm (BP). We start with the
bounded inference mini-clustering algorithm and then move to the iterative scheme called Iterative
Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP), that combines both iteration and bounded inference. The algorithm
IJGP belongs to the class of Generalized Belief Propagation algorithms, a framework that
allowed connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics and is shown empirically
to surpass the performance of mini-clustering and belief propagation, as well as a number of other
state-of-the-art algorithms on several classes of networks. We also provide insight into the accuracy
of IBP and IJGP by relating these algorithms to well known classes of constraint propagation
schemes.
