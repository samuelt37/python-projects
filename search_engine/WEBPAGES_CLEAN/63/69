         Curriculum 
         This course will not count towards any degree requirements. However the course is meant to fill an important gap in the ICS curriculum. Good writing and good communication skills, hence good thinking, are important for all our students and for their careers.

         Course Overview and Goals 
         Good writing and good communication skills, hence good thinking, are important for all our students and for their careers. Writing skills can be improved considerably by learning, adopting, and systematically applying a few simple principles and techniques. The purpose of the course is to help students improve their scientific writing skills considerably by first presenting these principles and techniques and then applying them collectively and systematically, using a hands-on approach, to scientific papers and other documents being written by the participants.  The skills learnt will be broadly applicable to different disciplines and different kinds of presentations and will last a lifetime.

         Topic Outline 
         Weeks 1 and 2 are used to go over the principles and techniques of good scientific writing. Weeks 3 and 4 are used to analyze articles from the scientific literature. Week 5-10 are used to apply the principles to documents being written by the participants in a hands-on fashion.

         Grading 
         Since this is a hands-on course, 50% of the grade will come from class participation. The remaining 50% will be equally distributed between homeworks and a final project based on the redaction of a scientific article.
