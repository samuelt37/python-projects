   For International Applicants : 
  Please note that we welcome international applicants. However, there are some important things to know about visas.
  If you are here already on some kind of non-education related visa (marriage and family, work, etc.), you  should  be eligible to enroll in our program without trouble. However, we encourage you to check with our  international center  as well as an immigration attorney. 
 You do not need a student visa to join our program, and therefore we do not support you in getting one through the program.  Because it is low-residency, meaning we do not require you to be on campus for more than a week at at time, we do not at this time have the ability to offer I-20s.</strong> Again, for additional questions, please consult with our international center and an immigration attorney. 
  
 TOEFL scores may be required for admissions (please check here for more information  http://www.grad.uci.edu/admissions/applying-to-uci/english-proficiency.html ) 
  UCI graduate application fee ( http://www.grad.uci.edu/admissions/applying-to-uci/app-fee-info.html ) Contact student affairs for more specific questions at  mhcid@ics.uci.edu
