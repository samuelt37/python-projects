Learning results from what the student does and thinks, and only from what
  the student does and thinks.
The teacher can advance learning only by influencing the student to learn.
  - Herbert Simon 
     

    
We don't have much time, so we don't teach them; we acquaint them with things
  that they can learn.
[Like previewing a route on a map, then sending out students to explore the terrain.]

 Instructor Office Hours : 
Please feel free to drop by any time during my office hours, without an
  appointment (these are  open  office hours).
If you cannot make any of these times and want to schedule an appointment at
  some other time, e-mail me to arrange one (or, if the question is small,
  just send  me e-mail asking it).
I answer e-mail periodically throughout the day (from about 6:30am to 10:00pm).
If you have a question that would be of interest to the entire class, please
 post it on the appropriate MessageBoard Forum (see below).
 

 Instructor Online Hours : 
I will hold online evening office hours every weekday evening before our class
   meets (Monday-Thursday, 9:00pm to 10:00pm) where I am reachable by by AIM
   handle  richardepattis .
  

 MessageBoard Forums : 
I have created a Message Board for this class and started five 
     
    MessageBoard Forums .
I prefer students ask questions on these Forums so that everyone (staff and
  students) can see the questions and everyone can participate in answering
  the qusetions (and exploring the answers).
Before posting on a topic, check whether another student has already posted on
  that topic.
    C++ and CLion :
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the C++ Programming
  Language, the CLion Integrated Development Environment, or how to use them
  together.
 
    Lecture Material :
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the readings and the
  materials discussed in class.
 
    Quizzes and Exams :
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the quizzes and
  exams (written and programming).
   DO NOT post solutions or any code , but feel free to ask
  about/discuss all other aspects of the quizzes and exams (including asking
  for clarification, input/output examples, etc: be specific).
 
    Programming Assignments :
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the programming assignments: specification,
  relevant C++, etc.
 DO NOT post solutions or any code , but feel free to ask
  about/discuss all other aspects of the programming assignments (including
  asking for clarification, input/output examples, etc: be specific).
 
    Find Programming Partners :
Find a programming partner. Relevant information is your Lab (partners should
  at least have labs meeting at the same time), approximate skill level (best 
  to match with someone your own level), work habits (e.g., prefer to work days,
  evenings, weekends; do/don't want to work early to get extra for early
  submissions), preferred location to work (if your dorm/home, say where that
  is), ...
  
Feel free to ask questions and answer other students' questions on these
  forums (subject to the prohibition of posting code for
   Quizzes and Exams  and   Programming Assignments )
I will also read all Forums early in the morning and answer unresolved
  questions.
When you post a question, choose the  title  line carefully; first check
  whether that question has already been asked.
 
In past quarters, the message board/forum mechanism have seen a good amount of
  traffic: course material has been clarified, questions have been asked and
  answered, and many interesting discussions have ensued.
But the efficacy of these discussions depends on  your  participation.
If the need for other forums arise, I will create them: feel free to suggest
  forums to me.

  
 Course Email :
The instructor, staff, and all students registered for the course can send
  email to everyone else by emailing the address
   ics46-W17@classes.uci.edu .
All messages sent via this email address will be archived on the
     
  Email Archive 
As the instructor, I will frequently use this mechanism to broadcast timely
  information to all the students.
Students should use this email address more selectively: mostly you should be
  using the forums mentioned above to ask questions, so all students can see
  your questions/comments and participate in the discussion.
One reasonable student use of this email list is to send email if Checkmate
  (the program submission system) appears to be down; by sending email I will
  learn about the problem and everyone will know I know.
In such a case (when I bring Checkmate back up), I'll send a follow-up email
  message to everyone.
  

Finally, remember to read the
   Announcements 
  link daily, on the course web; I tend to post long-lived information here,
  rather than via the forums or email.

It is well known (but often underappreciated) fact that consistent attendence
  of lectures/lab is strongly correlated with good course performance;
  therefore, I expect all my students to attend lectures and labs regularly.
Plan on arriving punctually -I may make important announcements at the start of
  a class- paying attention, and treating your classmates with respect.
  
If you do miss a class, your first point of contact should be other students
  who attended the class to determine what you missed and how you can catch up
  (see the course web too).
One of the most "bewildering" questions faculty hear is,
  "I missed class yesterday; did you say or do anything important?"
  

    Bottom Line
As a lecturer at UCI, my primary responsiblity is teaching; my primary
  activities are preparing course materials, teaching in class, interacting
  with students (in class, during [online] office hours, on MessageBoard
  Forums) and grading.
