 CFTP
 

   PURPOSE     
  Exact sampling for Ising models with positive interactions</strong> 

   SYNOPSIS     
  function samples = CFTP( model,numSamples,rep01 ) </strong> 

   DESCRIPTION     
   Exact sampling for Ising models with positive interactions
 using the CFTP algorithm described in [Propp &amp; Wilson, '96]
 INPUTS:
           model:(1 X 1) struct array with fields
                       N: number of nodes
                       w: (N X N) matrix of interactions
                       b: (N X 1) vector of biases
           numSamples: Number of samples to generate
           rep01     : the representation - 
                       1 if nodes take values from {0,1}
                       0 if nodes take values from {-1,+1}
 RETURNS:
           samples: (numSamples X N) array of samples

 NOTE: WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMRPOVE THE CODE A LOT BY STORING JUST THE RANDOM GENERATOR 
       STATES AT TIMES T=2^k, INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS!
