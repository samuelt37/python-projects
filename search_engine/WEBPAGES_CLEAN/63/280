Gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of mutations needed
to transform one input string into another, in a general model
in which substrings may be inserted or deleted at a cost depending
nonlinearly on the substring length.  The time bound
depends on the number of times the second derivative of the cost function changes sign.
