 ICS 33 Summer 2013 
   Schedule 

 

 

  This is a schedule of what we'll be covering in lecture, what days exams will be given, and other key dates (including project due dates) during the quarter.  As this course has no textbook, there will be no assigned textbook readings, though I may occasionally assign online reading from the Internet; when that happens, it will be listed in the  Readings  column below.
