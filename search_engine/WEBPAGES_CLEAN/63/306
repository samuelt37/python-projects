  Interface EventGenerator
 
   public interface interface  EventGenerator 
  
You should implement this interface in to order to be able to generate events for the simulator
 
    
 
    
      eventProcessed  (SimEvent)
     Every time the simulator processes an event created by an EventGenerator
  the EventGenerator will be notified via this method

        initializeGenerator  (Simulator)
     When the EventGenerator is registered in the simulator the 
   initzializeGenerator(Simulator) method will be called

    
 
    
   
  eventProcessed  
 
 public abstract void eventProcessed( SimEvent  e)
 
   Every time the simulator processes an event created by an EventGenerator
  the EventGenerator will be notified via this method
 
      
  initializeGenerator  
 
 public abstract void initializeGenerator( Simulator  sim)
 
   When the EventGenerator is registered in the simulator the 
   initzializeGenerator(Simulator) method will be called
