 <body>  Problems of Geometric Combinatorics  

 
   
Cut along the solid lines to make puzzle pieces.
 Assemble the pieces in the form of a hexagon so the
 symbols at each vertex on/within the hexagon match.
 Each problem has a unique solution.
 
     Problem 1  (10 easy pieces)
       and  solution 
      Problem 2 
      Problem 3 
      Problem 4 
      Problem 5 
   
Email me if you give up and want the solution for one of the other problems.
  This paper  describes how I constructed these problems.
  
Below is an example illustrating the solution for
a smaller problem that involves just 6 puzzle pieces.
