 Creating a wiki account 
     Using a wiki is often possible without creating an account (this depends on the security preferences).       However, using the wiki  with an account  is easier and better, because you can:       set a temporal bookmark on  RecentChanges .      customize and personalize the navigation.     set your time zone.     subscribe to pages and get informed when a change is made.     do much more.        To create an account, use the link  register  in the navigation area. Then you will have to enter:       a name (it is a good idea to use  FirstnameLastname ).      a password (not too simple!).     the password again (to avoid typing errors).     an e-mail address (for notifications or if you forgot your password)          Then click on  Create profile</strong>.        The account will be created and you can log in to the wiki using your user name and password.         You are logged in if you see the user name in the navigation area.
