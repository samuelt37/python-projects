    Dynamic Summaries paper accepted at ASE 2013 


  
   
    Date: 23 Jul 2013
   
  
   My paper with Prof. Xu and Prof Jones, titled: “Improving Efficiency of Dynamic Analysis with Dynamic Dependence Summaries”, was accepted at the technical research track at  ASE 2013 ! This work describes a novel technique to summarize the API method behavior in terms of the dynamic dependence relations observed therein.
