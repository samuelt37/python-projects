 Research Interests 
Text processing in a parallel data system is an interesting area that I am working on.



 Current Projects 
   AsterixDB  - Especially, I am interested in text-processing (a full-text search) on Asterix DB.
   Past Projects 
   iPubMed  - an instant, error-tolerant search engine on the  PubMed  database   Monitor - instant search analysis The goal of this research is to supplement instant search engine's performance without changing internal structure or data. This is done by embedding one JavaScript to original search engine. This JavaScript collects queries, number of result, etc. and stores that data to Server. Ranges of project are analysing user queries, Identifying sessions from queries, creating session related Statistics, and suggesting some useful queries to users by using log and raw-data.
