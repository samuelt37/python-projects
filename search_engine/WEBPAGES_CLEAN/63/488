 Accomodation 
    
   The group block at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach has  SOLD OUT .</strong> 

 But you are welcome to reserve your room at the  Hyatt Regency</strong>  at the current rates that they are offering . 
          Alternatively, some other hotels near UC Irvine that may be of interest are: 
           Ayres Hotel and Suites</strong> - Costa Mesa 
      
   http://www.ayreshotels.com . 
        
           Travelodge Orange County Airport</strong> - Costa Mesa 
   www.travelodge.com/hotels/california/costa-mesa .         


           SpringHill Suites</strong> 
   www.marriott.com/hotels . 

           Fairmont Newport Beach</strong> 
   www.fairmont.com/newport-beach/ . 


           Marriott Bayview</strong> - Newport Beach 
   www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/npbst-newport-beach-marriott-bayview/ . 
  

           More hotel options are listed here:   www.accounting.uci.edu/travel/resources/hotels . 



 Note that some of those hotels will offer a  "UCI" rate</strong>, but  only if you call them on the phone and ask for it .  


           Some hotels have a shuttle that may be willing to bring you to UCI. You would have to ask them. Or you can take a taxi. Ask the taxi/shuttle driver to take you to the University Club (or UClub) - the conference is being held in Donald Bren Hall which is next to the University Club</strong>. 



 Alternatively, if you want to stay near the ocean, Newport Beach is closest to UC Irvine. Or, Laguna Beach is farther away, and is quite nice. 
 There are many hotels to choose from in those areas - we recommend you look online for what suites your needs. You would need a rental car to get to UC Irvine each day.  You can park in the Anteater Parking Structure and walk to Donald Bren Hall</strong>. 

 
          UC Irvine is a confusing campus - if you are driving or taking a taxi or shuttle, we highly recommend that you print a UCI map and bring it with you.  
    Find here UCI campus .pdf  

 Donald Bren Hall is building 314 located in grid F6. 

   A group block of rooms has been arranged at the charming  Hyatt Regency Newport Beach</strong>. Room rates start at $189 USD per night, which includes:         
        
    - </strong>Complimentary basic wireless internet in guest room 
   - </strong>Two (2) complimentary bottles of mineral water per day in guest room 
   - </strong>Complimentary shuttle service to/from Santa Ana/Orange County (SNA) airport , Fashion Island, and Balboa Island 
   - </strong>Fitness Center access 
   - </strong>Complimentary access to outdoor games and water features at Oasis Pool. 
   - </strong>Discounted self parking: $15 per car per night 
      
        
  Shuttle to UC Irvine 

 A conference-provided shuttle will take people from the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach  to UC Irvine and back each day at several designated times (only). If you miss the conference-provided shuttle, or you stay at a different hotel, you will need to make your own arrangements to get to UC Irvine for the conference. 
  

   Airports 

  Orange County/Santa Ana (SNA)</strong> 
          www.ocair.com  
         Also known as John Wayne Airport, this regional airport is less than 5 miles from UC Irvine, a drive of less than 10 minutes. This is the preferred airport of local residents, and is closest to UCI. But it is a smaller, regional airport and most international flights don't fly directly into this airport. 
        
   
        

        
   Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)</strong> 
          www.lawa.org  
         This is the largest airport in the area, and many international travellers will arrive here. It is 43 miles northwest of UC Irvine, and is about an hour’s drive in normal traffic. 

   
        

        
   Long Beach Airport (LGB)</strong> 
          www.lgb.org  
         This is another regional airport option. It is located 23 miles northwest of UC Irvine, and is a 30-40 minute drive in normal traffic. 


            
   Transportation Tips 


 Getting to your hotel from LAX or Long Beach Airport 

           - SHUTTLES FROM AIRPORTS</strong> 

 There are various shuttle services that can be used  to get to your hotel from LAX or Long Beach airport . One service is  SuperShuttle</strong>, which gives UC Irvine visitors a  10% discount</strong>. To obtain the discount: 

 Schedule your ride online at SuperShuttle website  www.supershuttle.com . 
   Use Discount Code: B6FYL </strong> 
 For the conference hotel, choose:  Hyatt Regency Newport Beach, Jamboree Rd</strong>. 
 
        
           - RENTAL CARS</strong> 
 If you will be sightseeing in Orange County/Southern California, a rental car is a good option. The airports listed above all have access to rental car facilities. 
 If you are  staying at the conference hotel</strong>, there is a Hertz rental car onsite. You could rent a care from Hertz, and drop it off at the hotel. 


 Choose Newport Beach-Hyatt Newport HLE (On Jamboree Rd.)  
  www.hertz.com  

           You can park in the Anteater Parking Structure and walk to Donald Bren Hall ( building 314 located in grid F6).</strong>  
        
        
              
        
   
       
   - TRAINS</strong> 
 Although there are trains in southern California, they do not go to UC Irvine and they are not a common mode of transportation. If you plan to arrive by train, the closest station is the Irvine train station. From there you will need to take a taxi or two busses to UC Irvine - a taxi is much faster.
