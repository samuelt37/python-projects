Graph Algorithms 

  General Course Information 

 Coursework will consist of biweekly homeworks, including a
homework due in finals week. There will be no exams. Group work on
homeworks is permitted; each student should turn in his or her own
copy of the homeworks. The course texts will be  Network
Flows  (Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin) and  Graph Drawing  (Di
Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and Tollis). The course meets Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 2:00 - 3:20 in ICF 101.
