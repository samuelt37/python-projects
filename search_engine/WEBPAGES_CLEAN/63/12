double OETanimoto(const OEBitVector &amp;a, const OEBitVector &amp;b)
    
The OETanimoto function calculates the ``Tanimito similarity coefficient''
between two OEBitVectors.  This is defined as the number of bits that the
two bitmaps/fingerprints have in common divided by the total of bits set
in either.  This function does not require that the two OEBitVectors be
the same size, the bits lacking from the shorter OEBitVector being
interpreted as all zeros.  This function always returns 1.0, if the two
OEBitVectors are equal, even if they are both empty.
