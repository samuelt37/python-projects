On the history of Borsuk and Nelson-Erdos-Hadwiger classical
problems and recent results for lower bounds of Borsuk and chromatic
numbers in Euclidean spaces

Abstract: We describe the evolution of Borsuk and Nelson-Erdos-Hadwiger
problems and discuss the combinatorial method that gives new lower bounds
for Borsuk's and chromatic numbers of Euclidean spaces.
