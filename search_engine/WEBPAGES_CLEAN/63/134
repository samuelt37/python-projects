4.41 OEDetermineRingSystems 
 
   
unsigned int OEDetermineRingSystems(OEMolBase &amp;mol, unsigned int *rings)
    
This function determines the ring systems of a molecule.  The return value
is the number of connected components found in the molecule.  If the molecule
is acyclic, the return value is zero.  The ``rings'' array must contain
at least  OEMolBase::GetMaxAtomIdx  elements, and upon return it
contains a mapping indexed by  OEAtomBase::GetIdx  of which ring system
each atom is in.
The ring systems are numbered from one, up to an including the return value
of the function.  Atoms that aren't contained in a ring,  i.e.  for which
 OEAtomBase::IsInRing  returns false, are mapped to the value zero.
