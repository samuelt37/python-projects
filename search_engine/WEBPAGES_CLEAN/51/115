15.2.4 OETriposAtomNames 
 
This function doesn't involve atom or bond typing at all, but is
included here as it is related.  This function sets the atom name
field to ``XY'' where X is the atomic symbol for the atom and Y is a
sequential index per atomic number.  The atom name property should
typically set to a Tripos atom name before writing a Sybyl mol2 file
using the low-level OEWriteMol2File function.
