              Abstract   
We develop several algorithms taking advantage of two common
approaches for bounding MPE queries in graphical models: mini-bucket
elimination and message-passing updates for linear programming
relaxations.  Both methods are quite similar, and offer useful
perspectives for the other; our hybrid approaches attempt to balance
the advantages of each. We demonstrate the power of our hybrid
algorithms through extensive empirical evaluation. Most notably, a
Branch and Bound search guided by the heuristic function calculated by
one of our new algorithms has recently won first place in the PASCAL2
inference challenge.
