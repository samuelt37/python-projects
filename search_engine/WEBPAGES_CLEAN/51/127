	 http://host/dir/projectX/file.c 
*and*
	 http://host.dom/VERSION/1.5/dir/projectX/file.c 

put the versions at the beginning; make a version-aware server deal
with "VERSION/*" either as a CGI that fetches the appropriate
version or whatever.

 A relative link "../image.gif" or just "./page2.html" will get the
version with the same version ID.

The unversioned URLs refer to the 'latest' version, of course.

This lets you surf in the past as long as the site uses consistent
version numbers for all related resources.
