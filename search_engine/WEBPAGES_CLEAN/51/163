 A General Scheme for Automatic Generation of Search Heuristics from Specification Dependencies 

 Kalev Kask, Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents and evaluates the power of a new scheme that generates search
heuristics mechanically for problems expressed using a set of functions or relations
over a finite set of variables. The heuristics are extracted from a parameterized 
approximation scheme called Mini-Bucket elimination that allows controlled trade-off
between computation and accuracy. The heuristics are used to guide Branch-and-
Bound and Best-First search. Their performance is compared on two optimization
tasks: the Max-CSP task defined on deterministic databases and the Most Probable 
Explanation task defined on probabilistic databases. Benchmarks were random
data sets as well as applications to coding and medical diagnosis problems. Our 
results demonstrate that the heuristics generated are effective for both search schemes,
permitting controlled trade-off between preprocessing (for heuristic generation) and
search.
