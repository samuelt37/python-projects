  Progress  
      Study of Operating System and Hardware Protection mechanisms in the R4000 (w/ Jay Byun)
 
  Detailed study of the instruction set
  Detailed study of operating systems protection mode changes
  =&gt; conclusions for simple RISC processors (designed for Unix style protection structures), other operating systems/processors differ significantly
  Written report 5/11/98.
  
  Basis for formalization of current protection structure, basis for design of a protection structure for adaptable hardware
