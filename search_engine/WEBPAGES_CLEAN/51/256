 CompSci 267 Homework set #2 
 
   Consider the following two codings with source alphabet
     {a,b,c,d,e,f} and code alphabet {0,1}.
     For each code,
      Is it uniquely decodable?
        If not, prove it by giving two source messages that encode
        to the same code message.
      If it is uniquely decodable, is it a prefix code?
        If not a prefix code, give an equivalent prefix code with the same
        lengths of code words changing as few codings as possible.

   A full binary tree is  right justified  if, at each level of
the tree, all the nonterminal vertices appear to the right of all the
leaf vertices.  Show that there must be a lossless encoding method which
employs fewer than 0.85 N  codebits to encode each right justified
tree having  N  leaves, if  N  is sufficiently large.
   
   

   Compact codes come from conservative expansions of a trivial code.
     Prove that, for each compact code  C , there exists exactly
      one expansion sequence from a trivial code to  C , in which
      each expansion  S  ⇒  S' 
      is an expansion of either the longest codelength,  L ,
      or the codelength  L -1 in  S .
   

      Write a program to determine
        the number of compact codes of size 40.
        





   Consider the following generalization of Shannon-Fano coding to
     create a binary codetree for the set S of words {w i }
     with associated probabilities {p i }:
      create root vertex  r  and associate S with it
      initialize queue Q to contain  r 
      while Q is not empty do
          dequeue a vertex  v  having associated set V
          partition V into two sets V 0  and V 1 
            so that the sum of probabilities in each set is as
            nearly equal as possible
          create two new vertices, v 0 
            (with set V 0  associated with it) and
            v 1  (with set V 1  associated with it)
          attach v 0  and v 1 
            as sons of  v  via edges labeled 0 and 1
          if |V 0 | &gt; 1 then enqueue v 0 ;
            if |V 1 | &gt; 1 then enqueue v 1      
    Examine the cases when set S contains 4 or 5 words to see
     how much the compression rate of the codetree created by
     this approach can exceed entropy.
   Comment on the practicality and effectiveness of this algorithm
     as compared with that of Shannon-Fano.
     
   

   Use (a) Shannon's method of coding,
     (b) Shannon-Fano coding,
     and (c) Huffman coding,
      to determine the average codelength of
     (1) a binary code, and (2) a ternary code,
      for a source having symbol probability distribution
      .22, .2, .18, .15, .1, .08, .07.
