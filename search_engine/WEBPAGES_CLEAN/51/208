 Challenges in Integrated Adaptive Computing<body>

  Challenges in Integrated Adaptive Computing  
      Integration with core system mechanisms enables high performance
 
  Multiprocess environments fundamental, even for embedded systems
  Errors in synthesis, hardware, software are common.  
  How to build robust, adaptive systems?
       Adaptation of core presents protection, validation, and fault-containment challenges
 
  How to ensure process isolation?
  How to contain synthesis or hardware faults in the system architecture?
  How to validate a late-binding adaptation?
