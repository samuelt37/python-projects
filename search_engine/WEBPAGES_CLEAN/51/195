			    Text:         

  There is one required textbook for the
course:  

   Artificial
Intelligence, A Modern Approach. 
Second Edition, by Russel and Norvig (Prentice Hall).     

  The textbook explains the subject material in
detail. It is strongly recommended that you read the book. It is strongly
recommended that you read the book and attend all lectures and all meetings of
your discussion section. You will be responsible for all material covered in
the lectures and discussion sections, and for all assigned reading in the book.
  

    Grading:     

  -Quizzes (20%) 
-Two projects (20%) 
-A midterm (20%) 
					-A Final Exam (30%) 
					-Homework (10%).  

  These are guidelines intended to help
students plan their work in this course.  
However, the instructor does reserve the right to make changes in these
evaluation criteria.   A work-related conflict is NOT a valid reason
for postponing an examination.    Please bring your student ID to all
examinations.  

    Graded
Quizzes and Assignments:      

  These can be picked up from DistributionCenter
or in Discussion Section    

    Grading
Disputes:      

  Turn in your work for regrading at the
discussion section to the TA within 1 week. 
Note: we will regrade the   entire   paper: so your new grade could
be higher  or  lower.     

    Questions on Grading:     
For any questions regarding grades, please contact the TA during his office
hours or at the end of the discussion sections.  

    Obtaining Assistance:     
The best way to get your questions answered is by coming to lecture, discussion
or office hours and asking them there.  

  Any student who feels he or she may need an
accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately
to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services
Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such
accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.  

    Announcements:     
Class announcements will be made in lecture and in discussion. Important
announcements will also be posted on this class Web page.  
The Web page will contain the most up-to-date course information.  
Any corrections or additional explanations for the homework assignments will
also be posted there,  
so please check the Web page occasionally to stay up to date.  

    Homework and Handouts:     
The homework assignments are regularly posted on the Web.  

  Some homework problems may be difficult.
Homework that is turned in should be legible and well-written.  
A badly written, poorly presented solution to a problem is of little value even
if it happens to be correct.  

  The homework problems are an integral part of
the course. They complement the material covered in the lectures by providing
examples, applications, and extensions. You are strongly encouraged to attempt
all problems. Even if you cannot solve them, if you have tried hard to solve
them you may be more likely to understand and remember the solution. Our brains
learn something while attempting to solve a problem, even (and perhaps
especially) during failed attempts. So do not get discouraged if a problem is
difficult.  

    Discussion Section:     
You must be registered for a discussion section. The discussion section
provides you with an opportunity to ask questions about the lecture material.
It is strongly recommended that you attend a discussion section regularly. You
are responsible for all material covered there.  

    Academic Honesty:     
All work done on quizzes, midterms and finals should be your own work. Cheating
on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously.  
Any such incident will result in a letter describing the incident which is
placed in your file on campus.  
Depending on the severity of the incident, the resulting grade can range from
an F on the particular  
examination to an automatic F in the course. Additional penalties may also be
imposed by the department and the university.  
Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or
expulsion from the university.  

    ICS Change of Grade Option Policy:     
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to change their grade option is
the end of 6th week with instructor's approval. Dean's signature (available at
the ICS Student Affairs office) will be required after the deadline and the ICS
Student Affairs office does not allow a change of grade option for any course
after 6th week, unless the student has documented a medical or financial
hardship.  

    ICS Add Deadline:     
The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to add an ICS course is the end
of 3rd week with instructor's approval. Any course additions after the 3rd week
of classes requires Dean's signature and careful review by the ICS Student
Affairs office. If you are adding a course after the 3rd week, please go to the
ICS Student Affairs office.
