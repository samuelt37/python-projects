 Canonical Naming Scheme  
In an ideal world each individual residue and atom would have a standard, distinct name.  Unfortunately  several naming schemes for atoms  exist, particularly for hydrogens.  As such, in order to detect the presence/absence of atoms in a protein, an internal canonical naming scheme is used. The naming scheme used in PDB2PQR is the one recommended by the PDB itself, and derives from the IUPAC naming recommendations found in

  
J. L. Markley, et al., "Recommendations for the Presentation of 
      NMR Structures of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,"  Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. , 
       70  (1998): 117-142. 
 

This canonical naming scheme is used as the default PDB2PQR output.  For a list of standard residue/atom name pairs, please see the  PDB Change Advisory Notice  regarding the naming scheme.  

All conversions in PDB2PQR use the internal canonical naming scheme to determine distinct atom names.  In previous versions of PDB2PQR these conversions were stored in long lists of if statements, but for transparency and editing this is a  bad thing .  Instead, all conversions can now be found in the various XML files found in PDB2PQR - for more discussion on the XML files see the  xml  section below.  

There are a few additions to the canonical naming scheme, mirrored after the AMBER naming scheme (chosen since for the most part it follows the IUPAC recommendations).  These changes are made in PATCHES.xml, and allow any of the following to be patched as necessary as well as detected on input:
  
  Terminal Naming Additions
     N*         :   N-Terminal Residue (i.e. NALA, NLEU)
     NEUTRAL-N* :   Neutral N-Terminal Residue
     C*         :   C-Terminal Residue (i.e. CLYS, CTYR)
     NEUTRAL-C* :   Neutral C-Terminal Residue
     *5         :   5-Terminus for Nucleic Acids (i.e. DA5)
     *3         :   3-Terminus for Nucleic Acids (i.e. DA3)

  Amino Acid Residue Additions (see dat/PATCHES.xml)
     ASH        :   Neutral ASP
     CYX        :   SS-bonded CYS
     CYM        :   Negative CYS
     GLH        :   Neutral GLU
     HIP        :   Positive HIS
     HID        :   Neutral HIS, proton HD1 present
     HIE        :   Neutral HIS, proton HE2 present
     LYN        :   Neutral LYS
     TYM        :   Negative TYR
 

   
 Using XML Files and Regular Expressions  

As mentioned above, the XML files provide an easy way for PDB2PQR to parse data.  PDB2PQR extends the built-in SAX XML parser to allow the code to go from input file to PDB2PQR object without any intermediate steps.   

The difficulty of adding a new forcefield to PDB2PQR depends on the naming scheme used in that forcefield.  To start, either a flat file or XML file containing the desired forcefield's parameters should be made - see  AMBER.DAT  and  AMBER.xml  for examples.  If the forcefield's naming scheme matches the  canonical naming scheme  used above, that's all that is necessary.

If the naming schemes differ, however, conversions must be made.  These are made in the *.names file (see  CHARMM.names  for example).  In this file you will see sections like:

  
    &lt;residue&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;WAT&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;useresname&gt;TP3M&lt;/useresname&gt;
        &lt;atom&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;O&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;useatomname&gt;OH2&lt;/useatomname&gt;
        &lt;/atom&gt;
    &lt;/residue&gt;
 

This section tells PDB2PQR that for the oxygen atom O in WAT, CHARMM uses the names OH2 and TP3M, respectively.  When the XML file is read in, PDB2PQR ensures that the WAT/O pair points to TP3M/OH2 such that the appropriate parameters are returned. 

But for naming schemes that  greatly  differ from the PDB2PQR canonical naming scheme, this could get really ugly.  As a result, PDB2PQR can use regular expressions to simplify the renaming process, i.e.:

  
    &lt;residue&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;[NC]?...$&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;atom&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;H&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;useatomname&gt;HN&lt;/useatomname&gt;
        &lt;/atom&gt;
    &lt;/residue&gt;
 

This section of code will ensure that the H atom of all canonical residue names that match the  [NC]?...$  regular expression point to HN instead. This regular expression matches all three-letter residue names, residue names with an 'N' prepended (N-Termini), and residue names with a 'C' prepended (C-Termini).  For twenty amino acids that is sixty residue name changes, all done by a single section.  The use of regular expressions is therefore a  much  more powerful method of handling naming scheme differences than working on a one to one basis.

For those unfamiliar with using regular expressions, the two following links are quite helpful (and Python specific):

   Regular Expression HOWTO 
   Python Library Reference entry on Regular Expressions 
  

There are a few other additional notes when using the *.names file:

  The  $group  variable is used to denote the matching group of a regular expression, for instance:
 
    &lt;residue&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;HI([PDE])$&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;useresname&gt;HS$group&lt;/useresname&gt;
    &lt;/residue&gt;
 
This section replaces HIP/HID/HIE with HSP/HSD/HSE by first matching the  HI([PDE])$  regular expression and then using the group that is enclosed by parantheses to fill in the name to use. For more information on grouping in Python please see the Regular Expression HOWTO's  section on grouping . 
   Sections are cumulative - since CHARMM, for instance, has a patch-based naming scheme, one single canonical residue name can map to multiple forcefield-scheme names.  Let's look at how to map an SS-bonded Cysteine (canonical name CYX) to the CHARMM naming scheme:
 
    &lt;residue&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;CYX&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;useresname&gt;CYS&lt;/useresname&gt;
    &lt;/residue&gt;
    &lt;residue&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;CYX&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;useresname&gt;DISU&lt;/useresname&gt;
        &lt;atom&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;CB&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;useatomname&gt;1CB&lt;/useatomname&gt;
        &lt;/atom&gt;
        &lt;atom&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;SG&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;useatomname&gt;1SG&lt;/useatomname&gt;
        &lt;/atom&gt;
    &lt;/residue&gt;
 

The CYX residue is first mapped to CHARMM's CYS, and then to CHARMM's DISU object.  All atom names that are found in DISU overwrite those found in CYS - in effect, the DISU patch is applied to CYS, yielding the desired CYX.  This cumulative can be repeated as necessary.
     
 Adding User-Defined Functions via the Extensions directory  

The extensions directory is a particularly useful feature of PDB2PQR, as it allows users to add their own desired functionality to PDB2PQR and use PDB2PQR's object-oriented hierarchy.  All functions in the extensions directory are automatically loaded into PDB2PQR as command line options using the function's name, and are called after all other steps (optimization, atom addition, parameter assignment) have been completed.  As a result any available functions are particularly useful for post-processing, or for analysis without any changes to the input structure by using the  --clean flag.  

Please see the  extensions template  for more information about setting up a new script.  

One of the advantages of using PDB2PQR in this fashion is the ability to use built-in PDB2PQR functions.  While a full and more detailed API can be found in the  pydoc documentation , some useful functions are listed below:
