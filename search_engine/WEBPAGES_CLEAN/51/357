 Summary 

 Various stadiums across the nation, indoor and outdoor, use software programs which
interface with their public address systems to enhance the atmosphere of their events.
  In a nut shell, these programs allow the operator to play downloaded music and
sound bytes at the touch of a button. Presently, there are two companies that offer this
type of software, "Click Effects" and "Game Ops Commander";
Unfortunately, both a ridiculously expensive and neither are specifically tailored to
collegiate athletic events nor this University.  I believe this could be a very
interesting and educational student project.
