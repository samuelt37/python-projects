3.22.4 AddConstraint 
 
   
bool AddConstraint(const OEMatchPair&lt;OEAtomBase&gt; &amp;mp)
bool AddConstraint(const OEMatchPair&lt;OEBondBase&gt; &amp;mp)
    
The search space of a maximum common subgraph determination can be
restricted by constraining pairs of nodes or edges (atoms or bonds) to
be mapped onto one another in all subgraph solutions.  Failure to
satisfy atom or bond pairwise constraints will prevent any subgraph
solutions from being identified.  Constraints are considered satisfied
in subgraphs which do not contain any constrained atoms or bonds in
either the pattern or target molecules.

  
Both  AddConstraint  methods return true if a constraint is added
successfully.  If the pattern atom or bond in the  OEMatchPair 
does not exist as part of the query molecule created in the initialization
of the  OESubSearch  object then  AddConstraint  will return
false.  Multiple calls to  AddConstraint  using the same pattern
atom or bond will cause previously stored constraints to be overwritten
as constraints are mutually exclusive.  It is impossible to satisfy
multiple simultaneous constraints for a single pattern atom or bond,
hence the exclusivity.
