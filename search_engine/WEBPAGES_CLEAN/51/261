   String Formatting   
   
Are you tired of printing dollars-and-cents 
amounts in Python that look like  $ 12.0  ?
Do you want to have precise control over what 
the text results of your programs look like?
You're ready to learn  string formatting.</strong>
 
Python, like most programming languages, provides
a rich set of features for specifying the format of
text.  They make it possible to format things into
nicely aligned tables, or smoothly flowing sentences,
or even rudimentary text-based graphics.
Formatting specifications aren't conceptually difficult;
they're not like mutable vs. immutable or navigating
through lists of namedtuples containing other lists.
But they are intricate: They control the character-by-character
arrangement on the page or screen.  
Since even one extra space can mess up your results,
string formatting requires us to pay close, meticulous attention.
 
 
Suppose we define the Dish namedtuple and some
Dish objects as follows:
   from collections import namedtuple
Dish = namedtuple('Dish', 'name price calories')
d1 = Dish("Paht Woon Sen", 12.50, 340)
d2 = Dish("Mee Krob", 9.00, 355)
d3 = Dish("Escargots", 24.50, 95)
DL = [d1, d2, d3]  
 
Now suppose we want to display a Dish in this form:
   Paht Woon Sen ($12.50): 340 cal.  
This text, and any text we plan to print,
consists of constant parts (that are the same
every time we print the results) and
variable parts (that may change every time,
depending on the data).

 
Here are the variable parts of this string:
    Paht Woon Sen ($12.50): 340 cal.
 -------------   -----   ---
   VARIABLE            VAR         VAR    
The variable parts are the data values:
 'Paht Woon Sen' ,  12.50 , 
and  340 .

 
Here are the constant parts of the same string:
    Paht Woon Sen ($12.50): 340 cal.
              ---     ---   -----
              CONST.        CON.      CONSTANT      
The constant parts are the three strings
 ' ($'  (space-parenthesis-dollar sign),
 '): '  (parenthesis-colon-space), and
 ' cal.'  (space-c-a-l-period).
 
Next we list the  names  of the variable/data parts.
These might be Python variable names, or more complicated Python expressions.  In this case, the names are
 d1.name ,  d1.price , 
and  d1.calories .
  
Next we decide whether we need any precise formatting (a specific number of digits or other precise spacing).  
We will want these eventually, but for now, let's say no so we can cover some other issues first.
 
 
Copy the code below,
paste it into a Python file, and run it in IDLE:
   from collections import namedtuple
Dish = namedtuple('Dish', 'name price calories')
d1 = Dish("Paht Woon Sen", 12.50, 340)
d2 = Dish("Mee Krob", 9.00, 355)
d3 = Dish("Escargots", 24.50, 95)
DL = [d1, d2, d3]  
 
As we discuss each of the lines of code below,
copy the line into IDLE and run it.
 
 
First we print the variable and constant parts as usual:
   print(d1.name, " ($", d1.price, "): ", d1.calories, " cal.")  
This gives us our results, but without fancy formatting.
The  print()  function automatically prints one space
to separate each of its arguments; that gives us the
extra spaces we see when we run the code above.

 
Next we try to eliminate the extra spaces using concatenation (+).
[This will give us an error when we try to concatenate a
number into a string.  Once you run this code and see the message, comment
out this line or remove it so the subsequent examples run.]
   print(d1.name + " ($" + d1.price + "): " + d1.calories + " cal.") 
  
With concatenation and calls to  str() , we can control
the horizontal spacing precisely:
   print(d1.name + " ($" + str(d1.price) + "): " + str(d1.calories) + " cal.")  
 
The  print()  function automatically prints one space
to separate each of its arguments; we can change that
using the  sep=  keyword parameter.  First we separate
the items with the empty string instead of a space:
   print(d1.name, " ($", d1.price, "): ", d1.calories, " cal.", sep="")  
This gets the horizontal spacing right.

 
As another illustration, we can separate the items with
any other separator string we care to specify:
   print(d1.name, " ($", d1.price, "): ", d1.calories, " cal.", sep="---")  
 
By default (i.e., without our having to give specific instructions),  print()  prints a newline at the end of each invocation (at the end of each call to  print() ).  That's what
gives us the blank lines each time we call  print()  with no arguments.
In the code below, we see that each call to  print()  prints its arguments followed by a newline:
   print('Huey', 'Dewey', 'Louie')
print('Donald')
print('Scrooge')
print()
print('Daisy')
print("\n")
print('Daffy')   
Notice especially the two blank lines between Daisy and Daffy:  
One is for the explicit  "\n"  and the second is what  print()  automatically provides.
 
 
We can specify different behavior at the end of each
call to  print()  by using the  end=  
keyword parameter.
It says what to print (instead of the usual newline) after the call to  print()  has printed it arguments.
Saying  end=" " , for example, says, "Keep whatever
is printed next on the same line as what we just printed."
   print("--------------------------")
print('Huey', 'Dewey', 'Louie', end=" ")
print('Donald', end=" ")
print('Scrooge')
print()  
 
As with  sep= , the value of the  end=  
parameter can be any string:
   print('Donald', end="Zot! Zot! Zot!")
print('---&gt; This follows the end= string in the previous line    
We can do a lot with the techniques we already know,
but the most powerful tool for formatting text is the
 format()  method. 
We will use it in these two situations (although there
are many more that we won't cover):
   Specify a particular number of digits to the right of a decimal point (in the example below, two digits, for dollars-and-cents amounts):
         Paht Woon Sen ($12.50): 340 cal.  
 
 Place values into fixed-sized "fields" to line the values up:
         Paht Woon Sen  12.50 340
     Mee Krob        9.00 355
     Escargots      24.50  95 
 
 
  
Here is the syntax of the  format()  method on strings:
 
 
       FORMAT-STRING     .</strong>format(    SERIES-OF-EXPRESSIONS-TO-PRINT    ) 
 
 
We wrote above about the constant parts and the variable parts of what we
want to print.  With the  format()  method, the constant parts go in the format string; the variable parts are the arguments to the method (i.e., they go in the series of expressions).
 
 
Here are the semantics:  The  format()  method returns a string,
which we usually print out (but we could use the string returned by  format() 
in any other context where a string makes sense, e.g., by assigning it to a variable).
The string is formatted according to the instructions
in the format-string, following this pattern:  
 print(     FORMAT-STRING      .</strong> format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories)  
 
The format string looks like the desired output.
It contains constant parts and variable parts; 
in the format string each variable part is a placeholder
or "format specification" (shown below as a dashed line) for the eventual data value
that will appear in that place.
   "-------- ($--------): -------- cal."
   FMT-SPEC       FMT-SPEC       FMT-SPEC     
Each placeholder (dashed line) is a place where we put a
 format specification</strong>, which can tell Python which of
the variable parts to print and how to print it.
Actual format specifications in Python don't use dashed lines.
Instead they use curly braces:   { } 
 
 
We can combine what we've learned so far into this working
Python code, which of course you should run:
   print("{} (${}): {} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories)  
 
This code says to print the value of  d1.name  where
the first set of braces appears (at the start of the format string),
then to print space-parenthesis-dollar-sign, then to print the value
of  d1.price  where the second set of braces appears,
then to print a few more characters, then the value of  d1.calories 
where the third set of braces appears, and then the last few characters in
the format string. 
There are three arguments to  format() ; they correspond with
the three format specifications ( { } ) in the format string.
 
 
To control the formatting further, we can say things inside the curly braces.  
The syntax for each format specification has this form:
   {     ARGUMENT-SELECTOR      :</strong>     FORMAT-CODE     }   
To the left of the colon is a value that indicates
which of the arguments to  format()  to print in that space.
Usually we just take them in order, but Python allows us to specify them
in a different order:
   print("{2:} (${1:}): {0:} cal.".format(d1.calories, d1.price, d1.name)  
 
It's not that common to want to reorder the appearance of the arguments
in the format string;
normally we'll leave the left side of the colon empty.
(But if we didn't at least mention what could go there,
format strings would seem even stranger than they do already.)
The code below shows nothing on either side of the colon
in the format specifications.  It behaves just the same
as if we'd used  { }  without the colons.
   print("{:} (${:}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories))  
 
If we rarely put anything to the left of the colon in a format specification,
what can we put to the right of the colon?
That's where we put the  field width specifications</strong>, the instructions to Python
for how many characters in the formatted string to devote to each data item.
The syntax of a field width specification (what can go to the right of the colon
in a format specification) depends on the type of data being formatted.
Here are the three main types, for strings, ints, and floats respectively:
     FIELD-WIDTH     s</strong> 
    FIELD-WIDTH     d</strong> 
    FIELD-WIDTH     .</strong>    NUMBER-OF-DECIMAL-PLACES     f</strong>  
 
For example, a format specification of  {:5.2f]  says:
   Reserve a 5-character field in the result string.
 
 In that field, place a float number with two digits to the right of the decimal point.
 
  
Try running this example:
   print("{:} (${:5.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories))   Notice that the 5-character field counts one character for the decimal point itself.  
Note also that there's one colon that's not part of a format specification; it's just printed as a character in the result.
 
 
What happens if we use a larger field width than our data requires?
   print("{:} (${:7.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories)) 
 
 
  We use 5 of the 7 characters for the number, with the two extra spaces after the dollar sign and before the first digit of the number.  
 
 
What if we specify a narrower field than we need?
   print("{:} (${:3.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories))   Python has three choices in this situation:  It could give us an error message;
it could chop off the value somehow to make it fit in the specified-width field;
or it could take as many digits as it needs, even if that exceeds the specified
field width.  Python takes the latter choice, with the reasoning that it's better
to see the actual value with messed-up formatting than to see only part of the
value or not to see it at all.
  
So in Python, if the field width is too small, Python still takes the number of 
characters it needs.
 
 
In fact, if we always want to take up exactly the space we need for the value,
with no extra spaces, we use a field width of zero:
   print("{:} (${:0.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories))
print("{:} (${:0.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, 3.50, d1.calories))
print("{:} (${:0.2f}): {:} cal.".format(d1.name, 23424234, d1.calories))  
 
Another use of field width specifications is to line things up in columns like this:
        Paht Woon Sen  12.50 340
     Mee Krob        9.00 355
     Escargots      24.50  95  
 To do this, we choose a field width that's large
enough to accommodate the largest value we expect in a given column:
   print("{:20s}{:6.2f}{:4d}".format(d1.name, d1.price, d1.calories))   This says to place the dish name in a 20-character field,
the price in a six-character field (with two digits to the right of the
decimal point), and the number of calories in a 4-character field.
(By default, strings are aligned with the left edge of their field
and numbers are aligned with their rightmost digit; this reflects the
typical practice in typesetting data in tables.)
 
 
We can put this in a loop through our list of dishes:
   for d in DL:
    print("{:20s}{:6.2f}{:4d}".format(d.name, d.price, d.calories))  
 
Finally, we can write a function that 
prints our dish information in tabular format with titles:
   def print_dishlist_info(DL: [Dish]) -&gt; None:  # Just prints
    """ Print a table with a row for each dish """
    print("Name                 Price Calories")
    print("----                 ----- --------")
    for d in DL:
        print("{:20s}{:6.2f}{:4d}".format(d.name, d.price, d.calories))
    return
print()
print_dishlist_info(DL)   
There are many more features to the  format()  method than we have covered here.  String formatting is almost a sub-language of its own within Python.
You are welcome to explore at python.org or in other reference materials.
But for the problems or exams in this class, you will not need anything beyond 
what's on this page.
