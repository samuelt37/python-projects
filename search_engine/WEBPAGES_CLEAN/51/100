  Closest Pair Applications : Ray-Intersection Diagram 
(or, Crashing Motorcycles Efficiently) 

Click and drag to specify the initial locations and velocities of a
system of moving particles.  Each particle stops moving when it crosses
the track left by another particle.

   
   
   
 

 For more detailed information on this diagram,
see Jeff Erickson's page
" crashing
motorcycles efficiently ".  This implementation is based on the
 FastPair  version of our closest pair data
structures (with nearest neighbors found by sequential search rather than
geometric range searching); see  the source code 
for details.
