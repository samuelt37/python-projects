      A Note on Bounding the Partition Function by Search

              Abstract   
	  We develop basic best-first and depth-first search algorithms
	  for providing upper and lower bounds on the partition function
	  in an anytime manner. We also develop an Ïµ-guarantee depth-
	  first search scheme for OR and AND/OR search trees that
	  corresponds to a given graphical model.
