  Collection Requirements (cont�d)  
     Remove from Collection. It must be possible to remove a resource from a collection.  In the case of a resource that belongs to the collections directly, this results in the resource being deleted.  In the case of a resource that is merely referenced by the collection, only the reference is removed.
