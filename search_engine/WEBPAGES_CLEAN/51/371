 CFP - TUTORIAL PROPOSALS 

 We invite tutorial proposals that will benefit practitioners and academics who seek to understand and investigate the multi­faceted aspects of Global Software Engineering (GSE).  Thus, we encourage tutorial submissions that can develop practitioner or researcher skills in the field of Global Software Engineering, which includes topics in social, behavioral and human sciences, collaborative work, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Engineering, in particular, technology, and processes that can deal with distance, time, cultural and communication barriers.
