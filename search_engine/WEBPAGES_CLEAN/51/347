  Introduction 
     You can use all wiki markup for making your slides - just keep the following in mind:       for a Dia  Show, a bigger font will be used, so don't put too much on a slide or you will have to scroll      if you use colours, keep contrast in mind - especially if you want to make a printout.     presentation will look different on the beamer and on paper as on your screen.     if you use graphics, use thicker line width or they will be hardly visible.
