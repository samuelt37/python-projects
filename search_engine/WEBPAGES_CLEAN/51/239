  Introduction to artificial intelligence. 
 CS271 is an introductory course to the elements and algorithms underlying the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
AI includes subproblems relevant to many areas of research, including information theory, control, signal processing,
optimization, operations research, natural language processing and computer vision.  CS271 will provide an introduction
to the techniques of automated problem solving, including search, optimization and inference in deterministic and stochastic systems.
 
 As in previous years, the course will focus considerable time on deterministic constraints, logic, and search.  However, the inclusion and representation of uncertainty is critical in many modern aspects of AI, and will be introduced and discussed alongside deterministic versions of related problem types.
 
   Background.  
 The course is intended to be an introduction to artificial intelligence, and thus has few explicit requirements. Students are expected to be familiar with basic concepts from computer science (such as algorithmic complexity and logic); portions of the class will also include basic probability, and familiarity with programming may be helpful for some homeworks.
 
   Course format.  
 Two lectures per week. Homeworks due  in class</strong> approximately every two weeks. Two exams (midterm and final). Grading: 40% homework, 25% midterm, 35% final.  Lowest homework score to be dropped.
 
   Office Hours. 
 Office hours for the course are Monday 2-3pm, or by appointment.
 
   Collaboration. 
 Discussion of the course concepts and methods among the students is encouraged; however, all work handed in should be completely your own.  In order to strike a balance, we'll use the "work product" rule: while discussing anything related to the homework, you should retain no work product created during the discussion.  In other words, you can meet and discuss the problems, describe the solution, etc., but then all parties must go away from the meeting with no record (written notes, code, etc.) from the meeting and do the homework problem on your own.  If you work on a whiteboard, just erase it when you're done discussing.  Don't show someone else your homework, or refer to it during the discussion, since by this policy you must then throw it away.
 
   Textbooks.  
 The required textbook for the course is Russel &amp; Norvig, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".  Lectures should follow the book fairly closely, with minor exceptions.
