 Propagation Model<body>

  Propagation Model  
      A tree traversal.
 
     When a method is invoked on a collection resource, the method is �propagated� to all propagate members of the collection
 
     Collection resources continue to propagate the method invocation to their members
 
     The Depth header controls how far down the propagation occurs: 0, 1, infinity
