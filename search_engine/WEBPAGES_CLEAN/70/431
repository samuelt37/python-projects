 22 Apr 2005: 
Popular Matchings
 
Presented by Matt Nguyen
 
 
This talk is a presentation of 
"Popular Matchings" by David J. Abraham,
Rob W. Irving, Kurt Mehlhorn and Kavitha Telikepalli from SODA 2005.
 

 
The authors consider the problem of matching a set of applicants to a set
of posts.  Each applicant contains a preference list ranking each post by
preference.  A matching M is then said to be popular if there is no
matching M' such that the number of applicants preferring M' to M exceeds
the number of applicants preferring M to M'.  The authors give an
O(sqrt(n) m ) time algorithm finding the largest popular matching if it
exists.  Note that this is a special case of the stable marriage problem -
All popular matchings are stable.
