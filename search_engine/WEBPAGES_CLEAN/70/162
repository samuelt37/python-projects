            Virginia Tech: There is Hope    
        
           
               I cannot imagine the anguish and confusion that the Virginia Tech community is feeling right now.   Please take a moment to pray for the victims' families and friends.  This incident is a poignant reminder to all of us of the fragility of human life, and the depths of depravity that a human heart can achieve.  In days as dark and hellish as this one, it is vital for all of us to lay hold of the only eternal hope -- the  hope of heaven .  There is a Book that we can turn to in times of trouble.  Here are some verses:   Jhn 11:25  -- Jesus said unto her,  I am  the resurrection, and  the life :  he that  believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:   Mat 11:28  --  Come  unto me,  all  [ye] that labour and are heavy laden,  and I  will give you rest.   Psa 90:12  --  So  teach [us] to number our days,  that  we may  apply [our] hearts  unto wisdom.   Mat 5:4  -- Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.   Psa 46:1  -- God [is] our  refuge  and strength,  a very  present help in trouble.   Mat 16:26  -- For  what is  a man profited, if he shall  gain  the whole world, and lose his own soul?  or  what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?   Rev 21:4  -- And  God shall  wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be  no  more death,  neither sorrow , nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for  the former  things are passed away.

            Ping Pong in Bren Hall?    
        
           
               I heard that Bren Hall may have a student lounge with a ping-pong table.  This is welcome news, since table tennis is one of my favorite activities.  I used to play a lot of table tennis in high school, and I even competed in some tournaments (USATT rating ~ 1550).  Table tennis as a sport is actually quite difficult, since the ball moves so fast and since there are a variety of spins that you need to be able to react to within a split second.  Playing became really fun when I learned how to serve well and how to attack the ball with a topspin loop.  Watch this  video clip  of a rally between two pros to see how fast the ball can move in a real game.  Whether one is a beginner or an expert, ping pong is fun to play and watch, and that's why I'm glad that they are puting up a table in Bren Hall.
