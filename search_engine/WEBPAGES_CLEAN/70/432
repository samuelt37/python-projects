2.2 GNU C/C++ Compilers 
 
Currently, 3.3.3 is the preferred version of GCC for OpenEye's
libraries.

 
When OpenEye's libraries are build with a GCC that isn't the system
compiler on that system, the compiler is typically "configured" with
the -disable-shared option, so that there are no dependencies on
shared libraries, such as /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.so.  Unfortunately,
on a few platforms, such as Solaris 2.8 this isn't possible, as it
would be impossible to use OEChem in a shared library, if its built
on top of a non-shared libstdc++.  This may be fixed in future releases
of GCC.

  
On hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11.00, we recommend configuring GCC with the GNU
assembler from GNU binutils 2.14 or later.

  
On ia64-hp-hpux11.22, we recommend configuring GCC with the GNU assembler
from GNU binutils 2.14 or later.

  
On ia64-unknown-linux-gnu, we recommend configuring GCC with both the
GNU assembler and GNU linker from GNU binutils 2.14 or later.

  
On mips-sgi-irix6.5, we had to configure GCC 3.3.3 with -disable-c-mbchar
to work around IRIX portability problems with IRIX 6.5 prior to 6.5.19.
