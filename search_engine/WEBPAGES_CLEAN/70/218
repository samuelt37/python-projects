2.2 Reusing Molecules 
 

 
OEChem also provides a mechanism for reusing an  OEMolBase .  For
example, when processing multiple sequentially molecules in a database,
instead of requiring a new molecule to be allocated and destroyed for each
entry, the  OEMolBase::Clear  method can be used to reset a molecule
to its initial (empty) state.

  
The following program demonstrates calling the  Clear()  method of
our molecule.  Note that the  Clear()  in the example below is not
required as the molecule is already initialized by the implicit constructor.
The code below does demonstrate that the  OEMol  behaves like an
 OEMolBase  allowing it to be used with any of OEChem's
 OEMolBase  methods or functions.

  
    #include "oechem.h"

using namespace OEChem;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;
  mol.Clear();
  return 0;
}
