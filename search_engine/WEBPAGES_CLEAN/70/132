 Creators:  Yoram Reich &amp; Steven J. Fenves Department of Civil Engineering       and Engineering Design Research Center Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213  Compiled from various sources.  Donor:   Yoram Reich ( yoram.reich  '@'  cs.cmu.edu ) 

   Data Set Information:  
 There are two versions to the database:      -  V1 contains the original examples and       - V2 contains descriptions after discretizing numeric properties.  There are no ``classes'' in the domain. Rather this is a DESIGN domain where 5 properties (design description) need to be predicted based on 7 specification properties. 

   Attribute Information:  
 The type field state whether a property is continuous/integer (c) or nominal (n).  For properties with c,n type, the range of continuous numbers is given first and the possible values of the nominal follow the semi-colon.  Name / Type / Possible values / Comments     1.  IDENTIF / -- /	-- / identifier of the examples    2.  RIVER / n / A, M, O / --    3.  LOCATION / n / 1 to 52 / --    4.  ERECTED / c,n / 1818-1986 ; CRAFTS, EMERGING, MATURE, MODERN / --    5.  PURPOSE / n / WALK, AQUEDUCT, RR, HIGHWAY / --    6.  LENGTH / c,n / 804-4558 ; SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG / --    7.  LANES / c,n / 1, 2, 4, 6 ; 1, 2, 4, 6 / --    8.  CLEAR-G / n / N, G / --    9.  T-OR-D / n / THROUGH, DECK / --    10. MATERIAL / n / WOOD, IRON, STEEL / --    11. SPAN / n / SHORT, MEDUIM, LONG / --    12. REL-L / n / S, S-F, F / --    13. TYPE / n / WOOD, SUSPEN, SIMPLE-T, ARCH, CANTILEV, CONT-T / --
