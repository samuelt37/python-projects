 Manually impaired users<body>
  Manually impaired users  
   Includes people with
disabilities, but also many elderly users and "situationally
handicapped" users. They have, e.g., problems    
   1. Positioning the
mouse, clicking and dragging.    
                 Mouse operations should also be
performable using the keyboard only     
           (e.g., use cursor keys for
navigation, function key for selecting menu items)    
   2. Simultaneously
pressing two or more keys   (e.g., CTRL and SHIFT)  .    
              Allow users to press these keys
sequentially.    
   3. Entering larger
amounts of data    
              Provide default values 
          Provide next
possible values when user presses a key 
          Successively
provide next possible value; stop when user hits a key 
          Expand input to
first possible value 
              Allow users to define aliases
and shortcuts    
   For severe forms of
manual impairment, special input devices are needed (head mouse       , foot mouse           , suction tubes           , speech recognition                          )
