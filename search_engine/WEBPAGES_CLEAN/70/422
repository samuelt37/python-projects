 Domination When the Stars Are Out

 We algorithmize the recent structural characterization for claw-free
graphs by Chudnovsky and Seymour. Building on this result, we show that
Dominating Set on claw-free graphs is (i) fixed-parameter tractable and
(ii) even possesses a polynomial kernel. To complement these results, we
establish that Dominating Set is not fixed-parameter tractable on the
slightly larger class of graphs that exclude K 1,4  as an
induced subgraph. Our results provide a dichotomy for Dominating Set in
K 1,L -free graphs and show that the problem is fixed-parameter
tractable if and only if L ≤ 3. Finally, we show that our
algorithmization can also be used to show that the related Connected
Dominating Set problem is fixed-parameter tractable on claw-free
graphs.
