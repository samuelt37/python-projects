 Referencing Behavior: Principles<body>

  Referencing Behavior: Principles  
      References should be usable by down-level clients
 
     Default behavior should be what makes sense to down-level clients
 
     Always be consistent between individual references and references encountered when processing a collection
 
     Never require a server to resolve a redirect reference
 
     Be consistent across operations as far as possible
 
     Be consistent with WebDAV and HTTP semantics for operations they define
