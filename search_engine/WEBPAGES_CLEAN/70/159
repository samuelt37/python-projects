  Setting up git  
 

 

  Mandatory setup  
 

 
At the very least you will need to tell git who you are. The following two commands will set your name and email address. This information will show up in the commit log.

 
 git config  --global  user.name  "Your Name" 
git config  --global  user.email  "your_email@whatever.edu"  

 

If you have  Gravatar  account, the associated image will appear in many git  GUI  programs.
 

 

  Ignoring files  
 

 

  Git workflow  
 

 

  Simple workflow  
 
 git clone git @ redwood.ics.uci.edu:repo-name 
 git add foo.bar 
 git ci  -a  
 git push 

 
On the first push to an empty repository you will get the error:

 
 
No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing.
Perhaps you should specify a branch such as 'master'.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
error: failed to push some refs to '&lt;repo name&gt;'
 

 

For the first push you will need to specify the full branch name with the command:

 
 git push origin master 

 

This only needs to be done once per repository.
 
 git pull 

 

  Add-commit workflow  
 

 

  Fetch-merge workflow  
 

 

  I've made a huge mistake...  
 

 

  Best practices  
 

 

  Tagging versions  
 
 git tag WADS2013-submission 

 
To move a tag you do the same thing, but you need to for the tag to move with -f

 
 git tag WADS2013-submission  -f  

 

  Tips &amp; tricks  
 

 

  What repositories do I have access to?  
 
  ssh   -T  git @ redwood.ics.uci.edu 

 

  Word level diffs
