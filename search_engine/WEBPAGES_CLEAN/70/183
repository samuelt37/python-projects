            some of the most exciting and challenging problems in computer
          science today.  
 How can computers interpret large sets of images without any human supervision? How can algorithms intelligently search the Web and make sense of millions of text documents? What are the fundamental principles that govern systems that perform automated reasoning?  
 UCI researchers are at the forefront of building the next generation of intelligent systems. Their projects span a broad range of open research problems, combining basic theoretical principles from algorithms, probability, and applied mathematics, with highly visible and interdisciplinary applications in areas such as computer vision, bioinformatics, constraint-based problem solving, text understanding, data mining, smart sensor networks.
