  Graduate Research Assistant, Rescue Project, University of California
  Irvine and Calit2  (September 2004 to current) �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������   

 I am currently working on  MetaSim - the primary testbed that is
currently being developed in the Rescue project to test IT solutions in the
context of disaster response.  METASIM is a framework to support a
collection of simulation tools developed to test the efficacy of new and
emerging information technologies within the context of natural and manmade
disasters, where the level of effectiveness as measured by reduction in
expected losses, evacuation times, and other impacts can be determined for each
technology developed. Simulation models running on computers at different
locations are connected together to create a meta-simulation capability that
allows the assessment of the larger impacts of a disaster. Within this larger
testbed framework we are developing a micro level activity simulator (DrillSim)
at UCI. DrillSim is a multi-agent response activity simulator which models the
response activity at the micro level, thereby enabling integration of
technology by observing the impact of technology in the behavior of people who
are modeled as agents. I am exploring data representation and scalability
issues to improve the scalability and efficiency of these systems which are
highly dynamic in nature.  

    Graduate Research Assistant, SUGA Project, University of California,
     Irvine   (Sep 2001 � Sep 2004)       
  I worked on content adaptation for universal
accessibility in the Distributed Systems Middleware group. The goal of the SUGA
project is to make multimedia information accessible irrespective of user,
system and environmental restrictions, with the current focus on accessibility
to users with disabilities. Policies to adapt multimedia information according
to specific types of disabilities have been designed both at content level and
interface level. GURU an MPEG-4 based distance learning framework that can
modify MP4 content according to users� requirements is the artifact as a result
of this research effort.

   PROJECTS     

  �              DrillSim (September 2004 to
current):    It is a micro-level
response activity simulator developed as part of  Rescue  and  Responsphere  for the purpose of testing
IT solutions in the context of a crisis response. It is a multi-agent simulator
for simulating campus level crisis response activities. It has plug and play
capabilities where models and IT solutions can be incorporated into the system.
      

  �              MetaSim (January 2006 to
current):        METASIM is a highly distributed collection of
simulation tools connected by a series of translators that access a common
database. Simulation models running on computers at different locations are
connected together to create a meta-simulation capability that allows testing
effectiveness of IT solutions in the context of disaster response. Models
simulating various aspects of a response activity do not have to develop
protocols for data transfer with individual simulators, but are able to share
simulation results through a common enterprise database. METASIM has
standardized communication protocols to allow other simulation models to be
incorporated without redesigning the system.      

  �              GURU an MPEG-4 Based
Distance Learning Environment for Users with Disabilities (Jan 2003 �September
2004)     

  It currently being developed under the SUGA project
at UCI, that supports cross disability access. The distance-learning framework
is built on top of the MPEG-4 framework and supports the adaptation techniques
developed as part of the SUGA project. Dynamic adaptations for modifying
information according to users requirements are being implemented either as
MPEG-J API�s or built into the MPEG-4 layer. The interface is being developed
to contain the intelligence to dynamically profile the user using feedback
techniques.     

  �              Proxy Transcoding of
Multimedia Information for Cross Disability Access �     (Class Project- Distributed Systems Middleware
course, Apr 2002 � July 2002)      

  In this project we developed selection techniques
for server-proxy combinations in a distributed environment that was based on
user demographics and statistical studies. The best server-proxy combination
was based on availability of information, proximity of the server and proxy to
the request and ability of the proxy/server to provide accessible information
to the user.
