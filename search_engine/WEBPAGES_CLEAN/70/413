        Alexander Behm 
                     Alexander Behm is one of two Bren School recipients of the 2012-13 Google Ph.D. Fellowship Award. Behm, who recently completed his doctoral program, garnered recognition for his research in "Indexed and Distributed Processing of Similarity Selection and Join Queries." He was nominated by Professor Chen Li, a past recipient of the Google Faculty Research Award. 
 


 

       Where are you from? 
                          I was born in Madrid, Spain, and grew up in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.  What are your previous academic degrees? 
                          B.Sc. in computer science from the University of Cooperative Education Stuttgart.  Why did you choose to pursue graduate studies at UCI? 
                          Location, location, location. Seriously, as it often goes, there was a personal connection. My former mentor at IBM knew my advisor at UCI, and things took their natural course.  What is your current research focus? Why did you choose to go into this field of study? 
                          I do research on large-scale database management systems. I find this field particularly exciting because it spans many of computer science's sub-disciplines such as data structures, algorithms, languages, distributed systems, etc., and it naturally blends theory with a lot of practice. There is also great potential for innovation considering today's "Big Data" hype.  What are your future plans? 
                          I just joined a Bay Area startup called Cloudera, which develops the leading open-source "Big Data" platform based on Apache Hadoop.  How do you like to spend your time outside of school? 
                          I like taking my son out for a jog in his stroller. I also enjoy cooking vegetarian food and playing board and video games with friends.  Any words of wisdom for prospective grad students looking to study at UCI? 
                          Being smart is not enough. There are many smart people in this world. It is hard work and dedication that will make you succeed.
