   New algorithms for minimum area  k -gons . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 91-59 , ICS, UCI, 1991.   3rd ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,  Orlando, 1992, pp. 83â€“86. 
 
Shows that the minimum area polygon containing  k  of  n 
points must be near a line determined by two points,
and uses this observation to find the polygon quickly.
Merged with
" Iterated nearest neighbors and finding minimal
polytopes " in the journal version.
