   Sequential Signal Assignment  
        Sequential statement 
 ---- used in ----&gt; 
 Process Procedure

     signal_name &lt;= expression;  
    
  

 
     signal_name &lt;= expression after delay;  
    
  


 
See LRM section 8.3

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    A sequential signal assignment takes effect only when the process
suspends. If there is more than one assignment to the same signal before
suspension, the last one executed takes effect:
 
    process (A, B, SEL)
begin
  Z &lt;= B;
  if SEL='1' then
    Z &lt;= A;
  end if;
end process;  
 An equivalent process:
 process (A, B, SEL)
begin
  if SEL='1' then
    Z &lt;= A;
  else
    Z &lt;= B;
  end if;
end process;  
    
  

 
    If a signal which has assignments to it within a process is also in
the sensitivity list, it may cause the process to be reactivated:
 architecture EX1 of V is
  signal A,B,M,N,Y,Z : integer;
begin
  process (A, B, M, N) 
  begin
    M &lt;= A;
    N &lt;= B;
    Z &lt;= M + N;
    M &lt;= 2*A;
    Y &lt;= M + N;
  end process;
end EX1; 
In this architecture, the signals Y and Z will both get the same value
(2*A + B) because even though two assignments to the signal M are
executed, the first will always be superceded by the second 
    
  

 
    A sequential signal assignment may have a delay:
 process (A,B)
begin
  SUM   &lt;= A xor B after 1.7 ns;
  CARRY &lt;= A and B after 1.2 ns;
end process;
  
   The rules about what happpens when a delayed signal assignment is
subsequently overridden are complex: see the LRM section 8.3.1 or "A
 VHDL  Primer" by Jayaram Bhasker, section 4.14 
 A delayed sequential signal assignment does  not  suspend the
process or procedure for the time specified. The assignment is
 scheduled  to occur after the specified time, and any further
sequential statements are executed immediately 
    
  

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    Sequential signal assignments are generally synthesisable, providing
they use types and operators acceptable to the synthesis tool. Delays
are usually ignored.
 
All signals with assignments to them within a "clocked process" will
become the outputs of registers in the synthesised design.
  
Signals driven by a "combinational process" will be inferred as the
outputs of combinational logic  but  a signal which is assigned
only under certain conditions may infer a latch. Assignment to 'Z' will
normally generate tri-state drivers. assignment to 'X' may not be
supported.
  
    
  



 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, any signal assignment statement may have an optional label:
  label: signal_name &lt;= expression; 
A delayed signal assignment with inertial delay may be explicitly
preceded by the keyword  inertial . It may also have a  reject
time  specified. This is the minimum "pulse width" to be propagated,
if different from the inertial delay:
 output &lt;=  reject  2 ns  inertial  input  after  10 ns;
