                                  With midterms coming from left and right, WICS hosted a study session on Monday, February 1st. Over 30 people joined us to study. Groups of two to six people were scattered throughout the room studying, learning and munching on snacks. Despite the stressful time, it was still a relaxing place to get things done, make some friends and prepare for midterms.  Good luck on midterms everyone!
