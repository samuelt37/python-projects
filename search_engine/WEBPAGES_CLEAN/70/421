  Office 4216 in Bren Hall (4th floor), UCI main campus. Bren Hall is building 314 on the campus map.  
 Here's a    campus map  
with my building marked in red, and parking in the Anteater Parking Structure (APS) marked

There is also metered visitor parking in lot 12B (to the left
of my building on the map), which is a little closer to my office than APS.
