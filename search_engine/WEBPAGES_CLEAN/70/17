 Glider and Spaceship Guns 

Dean found a very simple gun based on two p68 oscillators: 

     

 The p68 can also eat gliders, or turn them 180 or 90
degrees: 

 
       
     
     
   

 The timing of p68 glider streams turns out to be quite
convenient for many reactions, but if the p68 gun is not thin
enough, one can use these thinner guns: 

 
       
     
   

 Perhaps the most versatile gun is one with period 408, allowing
glider reactions to involve both p24 and p68 oscillators: 

     

 It is also possible, but more difficult, to base a gun on the
p24 oscillator alone. It seems likely that the following gun can be
modified to produce periods of the form 24* k  for all
sufficiently large values of  k ; the gun shown has  
k  = 9. 

     

 Three glider guns can be combined to form a 4c/10 spaceship
gun: 

     

 One can also use glider collisions to make a gun for the wide
2c/5 spaceship 

     

and for the c/6 spaceship:
