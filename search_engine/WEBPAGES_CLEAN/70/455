The OEQBondBase class is the abstract interface for representing bonds
and bond matching expressions within OEChem.  For a description of
query expressions and their utility in graph matching refer to
(Section  3.1 ).  OEQBondBases are created by calling the
OEQMolBase::NewBond method. Please refer to the OEBondBase
