 Compiling Constraint Networks into AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs) 

 Robert Mateescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
Inspired by AND/OR search spaces for graphical models recently introduced,
we propose to augment Ordered Decision Diagrams with AND nodes,
in order to capture function decomposition structure. This yields AND/OR multivalued
decision diagram (AOMDD) which compiles a constraint network into a
canonical form that supports polynomial time queries such as solution counting,
solution enumeration or equivalence of constraint networks.We provide a compilation
algorithm based on Variable Elimination for assembling an AOMDD for a
constraint network starting from the AOMDDs for its constraints. The algorithm
uses the APPLY operator which combines two AOMDDs by a given operation.
This guarantees the complexity upper bound for the compilation time and the size
of the AOMDD to be exponential in the treewidth of the constraint graph, rather
than pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs).
