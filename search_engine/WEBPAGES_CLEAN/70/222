Parallel External Memory Graph Algorithms
 

 Nodari Sitchinava 

 
 Abstract: 
  
I will be presenting new results in Parallel External Memory model. In 
particular I will talk about solutions to List ranking, Euler tour 
technique and its application to problems on trees, finding connected 
components and the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
  
This is joint work with Lars Arge and Mike Goodrich.
