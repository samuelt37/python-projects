 Alumni mentoring program 

 
 

    The alumni mentoring program was created to foster the interaction
            between students and alumni of the Bren School.  
 By definition, a mentor is an advisor who may provide academic or
            career guidance, networking opportunities, and insights into the
            working world. 
 Students network with alumni to explore career
                interests and engage in mutually beneficial, professionally oriented
                relationships.  
 Similar career goals, shared interests or common academic
                backgrounds provide the foundation for the mentor/student relationship.  
  BENEFITS OF MENTORING </strong> 
            While the advantages of a mentor program to our undergraduate students
        may be more obvious, alumni also benefit from the program by: 
   »</strong>  Enriching
          their lives by making a difference in someone else's   »</strong>  Reconnecting
          with the Bren School on a personal level   »</strong>  Gaining new skills as they advise and counsel students 
  Sign up today  to make a 
difference in a student's life! 
 Additional information about the program can be found in the   Mentor Handbook . There are also a series of  mentoring tips  to help you establish a successful and rewarding mentoring relationship.
