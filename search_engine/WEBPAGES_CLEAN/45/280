  Description    
       
   We are all becoming accustomed to computing surrounding us
  in our daily lives. Cell phones,  TiVo , magnetic
  strips on credit cards�computing is a part of how we carry out the business
  of living day to day. The increasing ubiquity of computing places new
  challenges to its consumers and designers alike. This class gives you the
  opportunity to explore theoretical issues around the design of ubiquitous
  computing.  
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Policies    
       
    Add/drop:  If you
  wish to add this class, do so before the end of Week 2. 
       
    Academic honesty:  Please
  familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy:  http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm .
  The consequences of academic dishonesty are not worth the risks. 
       
    Announcements: 
  Critical announcements will be emailed to your UCI Net ID / Login. Please
  make it is set up properly and being forward to whichever account you
  normally read email from. Many other announcements will be made in class. If
  you miss class, please check with a friend to learn about any in-class
  announcements that may be important to you. 
       
    Attendance:  You
  may miss two scheduled classes without explanation�but this is not a
  requirement that you skip. 
       
    Web Page and Readings:  The Web
  page for the class, particularly the list of readings, will be updated
  frequently. Check frequently and be sure to refresh / reload the Web pages
  when you brose them. If a reading is added the day of a class, students are
  not responsible for it until the next class. 
       
    Email
  correspondence:  All email to me must include the class number, 203b, in
  the subject line. If you do not get a response to the email in 72 hours,
  resend it. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Course Mechanics and
  Grading    
       
    Lectures  will
  focus on assigned readings but allow ample time for class participation as
  described below. 
       
    Readings 
  will be assigned for each topic. Topics will generally last one to two weeks.
  Students will be asked to do short (12 sentences or less) commentaries on
  critical readings as noted.  
       
    Class participation
   includes attendance and being able to comment relevantly on the readings.
  In addition, each student will select one technical paper or book chapter
  (not in the assigned readings) about an aspect of ubiquitous computing
  technology or theory and present it to the class in a short Power Point
  presentation. See Links &amp; Resources for potential conference and journal
  sources. Class participation will also include a short presentation on the
  final results of a term project. 
       
    Term projects 
  will be completed as follows. Students will submit one page abstracts for
  approval in week 5. Students may work individually or collaboratively in
  groups of two or three, per approval and proportional scoping of the project.
  Term projects will generally be original commentaries on a specific theme in
  the research literature but may document an original research project
  provided it is well contextualized in the literature. Term projects will be
  approximately 10-15 double-spaced pages per student aside from bibliography.
  Past topics for term projects are available for reference only here. 
       
    Required Text: 
  The required text for the class is  
        Paul
       Dourish,  Where the Action Is: The
       Foundations of Embodied Interaction,       The      MIT
       Press, 2001.   
    It will provide a backdrop for our discussions throughout
  the class. Additional readings will be the center of much of the lecture.
