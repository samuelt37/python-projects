 ICS 33 Summer 2013 
   Assignment #0:  The ICS 33 Development Environment  
   Installation and Configuration on Mac OS X 

 

 

  Introduction 

 This document explains how to install the ICS 33 development environment on a machine running Mac OS X.  You'll need to be sure you pay attention to small details as you follow through them; as with many technical tasks, misspelling words, leaving out punctuation, or other seemingly minor mistakes can have fairly major consequences. 

 

 

  Step 1: Download and installing Python 

 If you've taken previous coursework in Python, you may already have a version of Python installed on your machine, but it will be important that you use the right version in this course.  Unless you have a Mac that is at least several years old, what you need is  Python 3.3.2 Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit x64-86/i386 Installer , which is available at the following link. 

   Python 3.3.2 Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit x64-86/i386 Installer  
  Mac OS X ships with an older version of Python already installed, though that version is not sufficient for our work in the course, so you'll need to install Python 3.3.2.  Different versions of Python can safely coexist on a system, and the version that ships with Mac OS X should be left as-is (since built-in parts of the operating system depend on it). 

 The file linked above is a standard Mac OS X disk image (.dmg) file containing an installer, so you should be able to simply download and install it as you would other Mac OS X software.  Follow the instructions on the installation screens â€” it's typically best to just accept the default settings. 

 By accepting the defaults, Python 3.3.2 will be installed in this location on your hard drive: 

  
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3
  

 After the installation is complete, verify that this directory exists, then make a note of that location; we'll call that location your  Python root  from now on. 

 Testing your Python installation 

 Some of you may never have used a Terminal window in Mac OS X before, but we'll occasionally have use for it in this course.  There are a variety of ways to do it on Mac OS X and any of them will do; a quick Google search should reveal at least one way to do it.  Once you've brought up a Terminal window, type the command  python3.3  at the prompt and hit the  Return  key.  You should see this show up in the Terminal window as a result: 

  
Python 3.3.2 (v3.3.2:d047928ae3f6, May 16 2013, 00:03:43)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
  

 If so, type  quit()  and press Enter to stop the interpreter, then close the Command Prompt window; you're good to go and are ready to launch IDLE! 

 If you see a different version, that means you have another version of Python installed instead of the one linked above.  If, instead, you see an error message similar to this one: 

  
python3.3: Command not found.
  

then your installation was not successful.  Seek assistance from your classmates who have successfully installed Python 3.3.2.

 Starting IDLE 

 Lastly, you'll want to be sure that you try starting IDLE and verify that it, too, is running the right version of Python.  The easiest way to launch IDLE is to open  Applications , then choose  Python 3.3 , then choose  IDLE.app .  You might also like to dock IDLE on the desktop menu bar, since you'll be using it often. 

 Once you start IDLE, you should see a window pop up, in which will appear the same message you saw when you started Python from the Terminal: 

  
Python 3.3.2 (v3.3.2:d047928ae3f6, May 16 2013, 00:03:43)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
  

 If so, you're ready to roll! 

 

 

  Congratulations! 

 Nice work!  You should now be ready to proceed with your work this quarter.  Additional installation guidance will be given as we need additional tools, but this will be sufficient to get started.
