 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Creating new Hyperwebs<body>
 

 Creating new Hyperwebs at the Chimera Website 

   
 Chimera 2.0 allows you to create different hyperwebs which can contain 
different sets of anchors and links.  The creation of hyperwebs is a
general system administration task so it is controlled at the 
Chimera Website.  To create two hyperwebs (bill_web and
flight_web) for your website do the following:
 

   Go to the  Hyperwebs  tab of the Hyperweb Manager.  
     The top of the website will just have the hostname on it.  (The host 
    of the testing machine is displayed in the screen-shot.)
   
       click on the hostname so that it becomes highlighted.  The 
	 Create Subweb  button
	on the bottom of the display should become active.  
   
       click the  Create Subweb  button 
	and type in the name  bill_web .
       click the  Create Subweb  button 
	and type in the name  flight_web .
    You should now have the following hyperwebs displayed in your 
 hyperwebs  tab in the Hyperweb Manager.
 

   

  You have successfully created two hyperwebs for your website, now you
will be using them to make anchors and links.  The next thing you
have to do is start the Chimera Server.
