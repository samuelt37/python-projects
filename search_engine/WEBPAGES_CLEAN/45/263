4.92 OEMacroModelTypeNames 
 
   
bool OEMacroModelTypeNames(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
This function loops through the atoms of the molecule, setting the
string atom type property of each atom, to atom type name of the
MacroModel atom type encoded in the atoms integer atom type property.
This is approximately equivalent to following operation:

  
    
  atm-&gt;SetType(OEMacroModelTypeName(atm-&gt;GetIntType()))
    
If both the string and integer atom types are required, it is faster
to call OEMacroModelAtomTypes and then OEMacroModelTypeNames (which
reuses the results of the first call) than it is to call
OEMacroModelAtomTypes and OEMacroModelAtomTypeNames.
