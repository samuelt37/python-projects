           MxGraphModel  

 
 Planning 
 
  Factor list   (cell array)
 Vacant list   (stack: vector + scalar)
 Variables &amp; dimensions somehow
 Variable adjacency (cell array)

 Factor()                               // blank constructor 

 FL[3] *= 2.2 (?) -- should this change the matlab factor or not? (it does; good?)
 msg[i,j] = newmsg -- this needs to, but can call "set"...
  
   mex::set&lt;T&gt; 
 
  copy the vector toolkit, but with set operations
 add equal operator for matlab 
 extensible to Variables class? (dimensions?)
   probably not (probably need code repetition)?
  
   cellVector 
 
  just the vector toolkit, but with cells? 
 Is it necessary?  Or can I just use the vector class somehow?
