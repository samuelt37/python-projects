 Listing Members of a Collection: PROPFIND<body>

  Listing Members of a Collection: PROPFIND  
      PROPFIND lists the members of a collection, along with selected properties, when used with Depth 1 or Depth infinity
 
  Depth 1: the collection and its members
  Depth infinity: the collection and its members, and its children and their members, recursively
       Key insight: a directory listing function (ls, dir, etc.) is just a specialized metadata retrieval function
 
     Benefit: a tailorable collection listing operation
