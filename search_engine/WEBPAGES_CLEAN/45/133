       Supporting Future Development 
       Research and development of the EcoRaft Project takes place at a public university.  As such, the project depends on grants and contributions to support its personnel and equipment.  We would appreciate any contribution you might wish to make to the production via UCI's  eGiving  service. 
        How to Use eGiving 
	 To make a contribution to the EcoRaft Project, please 
click the UCI eGiving icon below. 
       Currently, only credit card transactions can be given over the web, though an eCheck process is undergoing testing.  You can, however, download forms from the eGiving site to mail funds via cash or check. In order to ensure your gift goes to EcoRaft, please select the Donald Bren School for Information and Computer Sciences when asked in step one.  In the Comments section of step five, please enter "EcoRaft".       
       
 We thank you for your generous support.
