TIME SEPARATION OF EVENTS

        The problem of time separation of events is an important
problem in interface timing verification. Propagation delays 
are specified as a time bound (upper &amp; lower bound) due to 
manufacturing and environmental changes. 
        Three types of constraints are required in modelling 
the properties of a circuit viz. max (AND gate), min (OR gate) 
and linear (imposed constraints).  Computing the maximum separations 
under these constraints is discussed in the talk. 

  
         We restrict ourselves to ACYCLIC constraint graphs.
It is known that the problem can be solved in polynomail time
in  the presence of only a single type of constraint. The problem
is NP-Complete when both max and min type constraints are present.
The complexity of the problem with max and linear constraint 
is yet unknown (min + linear is dual of max - linear).  It is conjectured 
that it can be solved in polynomial time. We have studied the best known 
algorithm( by Yen) which is conjectured to run in polynomial time.
We are working on some approaches to have a tight bound on the 
algorithm and to verify the posed conjecture for max-linear constraint 
problem.
