Is Edge-Expansion Robust to Random Faults? 
Amitabh Bagchi 

 Consider the situation where nodes of a graph  G  become faulty
independently with probability  p  giving the graph
 G p  . The "critical
probability"  p  *  for a graph is defined as that value
of  p  for which
there is no linear sized component remaining in the graph
 G   p  *   with high
probability. We call a graph parameter ρ( G ) "robust" if
ρ( G   p  * -o( p  * ) ) = θ(ρ( G )) i.e. if the value of ρ is preserved upto a
constant factor till the point where the graph itself falls apart. 

We consider the robustness of a graph parameter important to the study
of the routing properties of a network: the edge expansion. We prove a
general theorem from which the robustness of edge expansion on a mesh
can be deduced.
