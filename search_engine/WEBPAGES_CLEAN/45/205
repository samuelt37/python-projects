4.1.3 Rxn 
 
The ``Rxn'' property is a boolean representing whether this molecule
represents a reaction or not.  The default value is false.  A true value
indicates that the molecule represents a reaction, whilst false
indicates the molecule is a simple connection table (and the ``Role''
property of each atom is  OERxnRole::None ).
