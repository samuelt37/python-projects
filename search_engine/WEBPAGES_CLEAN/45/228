   ICS 1F -- What Can We Compute? 
Winter Quarter, 1998 
Course Outline and Relevant Reading   

 Instructor:
 David Eppstein ,
CS 358D, 824-6384,
 eppstein@ics.uci.edu .
Course work will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final exam. Group work on homeworks is not permitted. 

 Readings in the texts are indicated in brackets after the lecture topic
to which they correspond. ECM stands for Essential Computer
Mathematics, while NTO stands for The New Turing Omnibus. The
abbreviation of the book is followed by a colon and a chapter number. For
example, ``NTO:22'' refers to chapter 22 of The New Turing
Omnibus. Occasionally the chapter number is followed by a period and a
section number. For example, ``ECM:14.1'' refers to section 1 of chapter
14 of Essential Computer Mathematics. An asterisk preceding a
reading, such as [NTO:*13], means that the chapter contains some
difficult material and you are not expected to read it completely and in
detail. 

 This outline is not absolutely firm. Some changes may be made as the
quarter progresses.
