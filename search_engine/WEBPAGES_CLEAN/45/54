    Guidelines for graphical menus 
       Â            


   

   


     Menu items 
(= "icons") should be recognizable and distinguishable within the normal viewing 
distance, under different light conditions.       Should 
be esthetically pleasing          Global 
properties (like form, color or size) are much more important than local properties 
(like details to increase likeness):        Abstract 
icons become much faster selected than concrete icons.                  
    
    The selection 
speed for abstract items seems to be less dependent on the number of icons than 
is the case for concrete and textual items ("parallel search").   
        Similar objects/functions 
should be assigned similar icons.       Users 
should be able to easily understand the intended meaning of icons, or at least 
be able to learn it quickly.     The 
addition of textual labels makes it easier for beginning users to learn, and for 
infrequent users to recognize, the graphical menu items.   </body>
