        On Combining Graph-based Variance Reduction schemes    
        Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
In this paper, we consider two variance reduction
schemes that exploit the structure of the primal
graph of the graphical model: Rao-Blackwellised
w-cutset sampling and AND/OR sampling. We
show that the two schemes are orthogonal and
can be combined to further reduce the variance.
Our combination yields a new family of estimators
which trade time and space with variance.
We demonstrate experimentally that the new estimators
are superior, often yielding an order of
magnitude improvement over previous schemes
on several benchmarks.
