 Cygwin Toolset Download and Installation 
 
  
  
 Download/Install the Cygwin Toolset 
  
 Cygwin  is a collection of GNU and Open Source tools that provide a
     Linux-like environment for Windows: using it we can install and
     use  llvm  (which includes the  GCC  compilers),
      Clang  (which includes  Clang  compilers),
      GDB  (a debugger used by both compilers),
     and  make / cmake  (tools that which we use to specify how to
     build -compile and link- C++ programs).
   Cygwin and it toolset occupy about 1.7 GB on disk.
  
In this handout you will download and install the Cygwin toolset; in the
  next you will download a version of  CLion , an Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE) for using these tools (or you can choose to use these
  tools via a command-line).
  
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Cygwin and its toolset.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely, before performing the action that it
  describes.

  Downloading and Installing 
  Click
        
     Cygwin64 
     
    The following  Cygwin 
      home page should appear in your browser.
      
       

   Click the  setup-x86_64.exe  link on that page, which downloads that
       executable file: executing this file will install the 64-bit version of
       Cygwin.
     
    On some browswers the following pop-up window will appear on your screen.
        
          
    If you see this window, click its  Save File  button.
      

    After downloading this file, its icon will appear on your screen as
      follows. 
        
          
    Save this file for future use, in case you need to install more Cygwin
      tools: on my system I stored this file as
      C:\ZData\Installed Software\setup-x86_64.exe 
  

   Double-click the  setup-x86_64.exe  file.
     
    When run, the following  Open File - Security 
      pop-up window  might  appear on your screen.
      
       

   If the window above appears, click the  Run  button on this window.

      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Click the  Next&gt;  button on this window.
     
    The following  Cygwin Setup - Choose Installation Type 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.

       radio button should be pushed (the default).
  

   Click the  Next&gt;  button on this window.
     
    The following  Cygwin Setup - Select Local Package Directory 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    This is a temporary directory in which Cygwin will create folders that it
      downloads files into; it will delete the files/folders here before
      finishing.
    For simplicity and consistency, use the default
      Local Package Directory .

    There are many sites from which Cygwin can be downloaded.
    I would leave the top one ( http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com )
      selected (the default).
  

   Click the  Next&gt;  button on this window.
     
    The following  Cygwin Setup - Select Packages

      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
      
       

   Click the  Next&gt;  button on this window.
     
    The following  Cygwin Setup - Resolving Dependencies 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Click the  Next&gt;  button on this window.
     
    The following  Cygwin Setup  progress
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    It will cycle through the Downloading, Installing, and Running tasks.
    Downloading itself might take minutes (depending on your connection
      speed); Installing and Running can also take minutes.
    On my machine, with a fast connection speed, the entire process took about
      10 minutes; sometimes it will pause for a few seconds (often with
       0%  progress showing on the window: let it finish).
      
    Eventually this window will be replaced by the following
       Cygwin Setup - Installation Status and Create Icons  
      window on your screen.
      
       
    I recommend that you leave checked the  Create icon on Desktop 
      checkbox, and uncheck the  Add icon to Start Menu  checkbox.
    Place the  
     (Cygwing64 Terminal icon) on your
      desktop in convenient place (especially if you plan to use this Cygwin
      toolset with a Command Line instead of CLion).

   Click the  Finish  button on this window.
 
   

   
Finally, place  C:\cygwin64\bin  on the  Path , so that the
   Cygwin  toolset is available for use.
      Click  Start 
      Click  Control Panel 
      Click  System and Security 
      Click  System 
      Click  Advance system settings 
     
       
    The following  System Properties 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
     
       
       Click  Enviroment Variables... 
     
       
    Something like the following  System Properties 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
     
       
       In the  System variables  (lower) part, scroll to line starting
           with  Path  and click that line (which should become
           highlighted).
         
         IMPORTANT: Even though you see a highlighted PATH in the User
             variables (top part) look for Path (not CLASSPATH) in the lower
             part to change it. 
         
     
       Click  Edit... 
     
       Copy the text  C:\cygwin64\bin; 
          (include everything from  C  to  ; ) and then paste
          it at the very start of the  Variable Value  text entry.
         
        When done, the  Edit System Variable  pop-up window should look
          something like
      
       
       Click  OK  for each of the pop-up windows above, to terminate them
          (3  OK s total), and delete ( X ) the  System  window.
         

The Cygwin toolset (all the necessary programming tools) are now installed.
You are now ready to install the  CLion IDE
