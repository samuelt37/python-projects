 UC IRVINE - ICS 227 User Interfaces and Software Engineering 

 Resources 
 
      Primary Readings 

 The primary resource for the class are papers placed in the file
cabinet near the 4th floor copy center in CS 1. The file drawer is
labeled "Course Handouts." There is a hanging folder labeld "Redmiles"
and "ICS227". Handouts for each class will be placed in an individual manila folder. 

 COPY THE HANDOUT(S) -- DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE XEROX AREA. 

 We follow this procedure to comply with copyright laws. Also, it
allows "course ajustments" depending on the class' abilities and
interests.
