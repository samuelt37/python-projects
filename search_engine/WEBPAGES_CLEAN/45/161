  AND  I NFORMATION    
    Instructor:   David G. Kay ,
  5056 Donald Bren Hall.  Stop by any time, or send electronic mail to "   kay   ".  
    Meeting time and place:  Wednesdays
  9:00 to 11:50 a.m., in room DBH 1423.  Since this is a two-unit
  course, we may adjust the times slightly or skip the occasional class meeting.  
    Course goals:  In this course we will
  cover teaching computer science at the college level, from the instructor's
  perspective.  This perspective is useful even for students, as consumers
  of instruction, but we presume that participants in this course have some
  (perhaps tentative) plans to teach computer science, whether through University
  Extension, Summer Sessions, or their own academic job.  We will look at
  (and in most cases practice) designing and running one's own course,
  designing assignments and exams, setting grades, preparing teaching portfolios
  (records of your teaching for use in job applications and promotion cases),
  making curricular decisions, and other related issues.  
    Course requirements:  This seminar
  is not designed to impose a large time burden on the participants beyond
  the class meetings themselves.  Grading is satisfactory/unsatisfactory or
  pass/not-pass.  But it is important that you attend the class meetings,
  participate in the discussions, and prepare for the various activities,
  which will include some readings and a variety of informal presentations
  leading towards your own complete design of a course.
