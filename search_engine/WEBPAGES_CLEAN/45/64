   Choosing subsets with maximum weighted average .

D. S. Hirschberg .  Tech. Rep. 95-12, ICS, UCI, 1995 .  
 5th MSI Worksh. on Computational Geometry , 1995, pp. 7–8 .   J. Algorithms  24: 177–193, 1997 .
 
Uses geometric optimization techniques to find, among  n  weighted values,
the  k  to drop so as to maximize the weighted average of the remaining values.
The feasibility test for the corresponding decision problem involves
 k -sets in a dual line arrangement.

    Geometric thickness of complete graphs .  M. Dillencourt ,

(special issue for GD98).
 
We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

    Improved combinatorial group testing for
real-world problem sizes.  
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
and  D. S. Hirschberg .  9th Worksh. Algorithms and Data Structures,  Waterloo, 2005. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3608, 2005, pp. 86–98.  arXiv:cs.DS/0505048 .  SIAM J. Computing  36 (5): 1360–1375, 2007.
 
We study practically efficient methods for finding few
flawed items among large sets of items, by testing whether there
exist flaws in each of a small number of batches of items.

    Combinatorial pair testing: distinguishing workers from slackers . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
and  D. S. Hirschberg .  arXiv:1305.0110 . 
13th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2013), London, Ontario.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8037 , 2013, pp. 316–327 .  
We study the problem of distinguishing workers (people who complete
their assigned tasks) from slackers (people who do not contribute
towards the completion of their tasks) by grouping people in pairs and
assigning a task to each group.
  
    From discrepancy to majority . 
D. Eppstein
and  D. S. Hirschberg .  arXiv:1512.06488 .  Proc. 12th Latin American Theoretical Informatics Symposium (LATIN
2016) , Ensenada, Mexico.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  9644 (2016), pp. 390–402 .
 
We provide upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of a problem
in which the input is a collection
of two-colored items, and the problem is to either find an item of the
majority color or to determine that there is no majority,
by performing queries that determine the discrepancy of fixed-size
subsets of the items.
