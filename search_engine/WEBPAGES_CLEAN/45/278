  Note that some demos will require the user to show the right credentials   (e.g., user and password) to provide full functionality. This restriction is due to the fact that associated privacy and security risks require the user to adhere to an appropriate IRB protocol (a required protocol for any human subject research).

 Our team has an appropriate IRB protocol  for data collection over the Responsphere sensing infrastructure at UCI and the protocol
has a well established procedure to add other researchers. To be included into our protocol (and thus obtain the necessary credentials), please send an email to  cbdaviso [at] uci.edu .

     SATrecorder v2.0: visualizing and masking streams based on sensor-level privacy policies  .
  This video demonstrates how sensor-level policies are not enough to protect privacy since
  they do not protect against inferences (e.g., one can infer who the people are in the video
  from the private camera because their identity is not masked out in the public camera located next to it).
