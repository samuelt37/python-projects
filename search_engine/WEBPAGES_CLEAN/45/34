   Listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs in near-optimal time .

 D. Strash .  arXiv:1006.5440 . 
Workshop on Exact Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems, Dagstuhl, Germany, 2010.  Proc. 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation
(ISAAC 2010) , Jeju, Korea, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6506, 2010, pp. 403–414 .  
We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3 d/3 ) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.
  
For the journal version, see " Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal
time ," which combines results from this and a different conference paper.
  
    Drawing graphs in the plane with a prescribed outer face and
polynomial area .  E. Chambers ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 129–140 .  arXiv:1009.0088 .   J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications  16 (2): 243–259, 2012 .
 
Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.
  
    Optimal 3D angular resolution for low-degree graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. Löffler ,
E. Mumford, and
 M. Nöllenburg .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 208–219 .  arXiv:1009.0045 .   J. Graph Algorithms
and Applications  17 (3): 173–200, 2013 .
 
We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.
  
    Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the
bounded faces have small dimension . 
D. Eppstein and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 27th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Paris, 2011, pp. 361–368.  arXiv:1103.2575 .   Discrete Comput. Geom.  50 (1): 1–21, 2013 .
 
Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .

We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,
and partitions of those rectangles into smaller rectangles, to form
stylized visualizations of hierarchically subdivided geographic regions.
There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much
of the geographic information from the input we require the output to preserve.
  
    Tracking moving objects with few handovers .

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.
  
    Category-based routing in social networks: membership dimension and the small-world phenomenon . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 M. Löffler ,
 D. Strash , and
 L. Trott .  Workshop on Graph Algorithms and Applications , Zürich,
Switzerland, July 2011.  International Conference on Computational
Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN 2011) , Salamanca, Spain, October
2011.  arXiv:1108.4675 .   Theor. Comput. Sci.  514: 96–104, 2013 . (Special issue on Graph
Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)  
We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.
  
    Planar and poly-arc Lombardi drawings .  C. Duncan ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 S. Kobourov , and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 308–319.  arXiv:1109.0345 .
 
We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.
