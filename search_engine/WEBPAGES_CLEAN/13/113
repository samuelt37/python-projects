    Judging 6th Grade Science Projects at the IUSD Science Fair 2013

   This morning i headed out to the 32nd Annual Irvine Unified School District Science Fair to judge science projects by 6th grade students. It was a great experience to judge some really smart kids and their well thought out ideas, projects and experiments.

 The students did a good job articulating their work. It was evident that the schools in Irvine, CA are doing an excellent job in teaching their students good practical science and more importantly sound methodology for scientific experimentation. 

 It was my first time to any science fair as a judge (having been to a few of these events as a student back in my school going years in India) and it won’t be an understatement to say that i was probably as nervous (but in a good way) about the fair as the students, if not more. 

 I would like to thank my colleague and friend Nicholas DiGiuseppe for getting me to sign up for this and the IUSD for giving me this opportunity. 

 All in all, and i reiterate, it was a great experience.
