 Balloon Popping With Applications to Ascending Auctions 

 (from FOCS 2007) authored by Nicole Immorlica,
 Anna R Karlin, Mohammad Mahdian, and Kunal Talwar 

 presented by Matt Nguyen 

 Abstract: 
The authors study the power of ascending auctions in a scenario in
which a seller is selling a collection of identical items to anonymous
unit-demand bidders. They show that even with full knowledge of the
set of bidders' private valuations for the items, if the bidders are
ex-ante identical, no ascending auction can extract more than a
constant times the revenue of the best fixed price scheme.
 
This problem is equivalent to the problem of coming up with an optimal
strategy for blowing up indistinguishable balloons with known
capacities in order to maximize the amount of contained air. They show
that the algorithm which simply inflates all balloons to a fixed
volume is close to optimal in this setting.
