 Graduate Student Policies: Comprehensive Exam 

 
 

 Written Comprehensive/Phase II Exam 
 M.S. students who elect for the Comprehensive Exam option must pass a
comprehensive examination offered by the department or by a representative of
the specific research area. Students should speak to the ICS Graduate Counselor
or research area representative regarding test dates, preparation, and reading
lists. The faculty within the particular area develops the exam; this may
result in the content and structure varying from year to year. 
 Ph.D. students must also pass a written comprehensive examination offered by the 
student’s department (see specific degree requirements for more information as this exam may vary 
by degree/concentration). Students should speak to their advisor, research area representative or the ICS graduate counselors 
regarding test dates, preparation, and reading lists. Faculty from the 
particular research area develop the exam, so the content and structure may vary 
from year to year.  
 The exam is graded on three levels: M.S. Pass, Ph.D. Pass, and Fail.  
 Students may re-take
the exam once. Ph.D. students who receive an M.S. Pass can qualify for the M.S. degree, but 
must re-take the exam and pass at the Ph.D. level to continue in the Ph.D. 
program. 
 To take the exam for a third time, students must petition both
the ICS Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Dean of Graduate Division
for permission. If the petition is denied, the student may be dismissed from
the program. 
Once the exam is passed at the desired level, please make sure the 
appropriate paperwork is filed with the Bren School graduate counselor.
