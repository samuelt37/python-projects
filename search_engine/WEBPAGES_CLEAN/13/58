  Euler's Formula,
Proof 3: Induction on Vertices
 

This argument is the planar dual to the proof by
induction on faces.

 
If G has only one vertex, each edge is a Jordan curve,
so there are E+1 faces and F+V-E=(E+1)+1-E=2.
Otherwise, choose an edge  e  connecting two
different vertices of G, and contract it.  This decreases both the
number of vertices and
edges by one, and the result then holds by induction.
