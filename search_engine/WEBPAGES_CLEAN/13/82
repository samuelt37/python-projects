 AND/OR Tree Search for Constraint Optimization 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents and evaluates the power of a new framework for
constraint optimization, based on the concept of AND/OR search trees. The virtue
of the AND/OR search tree representation is that its size may be smaller than
that of a traditional OR search tree. We introduce a new generation of depth first
Branch-and-Bound algorithms that traverse an AND/OR search space and use the
Mini-Bucket approximation scheme to generate heuristics to guide the search.
Our preliminary experimental work shows that the new approach is competitive
and in many cases superior to state of the art systematic search algorithms that
explore the regular OR space.
