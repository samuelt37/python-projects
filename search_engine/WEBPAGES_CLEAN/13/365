 Conflict-Free Coloring of Shallow Discs

Abstract:
  
We prove that any collection of n discs in which each one intersects at 
most  k  others, can be colored with at most  O (log 3  k ) colors so that for 
each point  p  in the union of all discs there is at least one disc in the 
collection containing  p  whose color differs from that of all other members
of the collection that contain  p . This is motivated by a problem on 
frequency assignments in cellular networks, and improves the best 
previously known upper bound of  O (logÂ  n ) when  k  is much smaller than  n .
