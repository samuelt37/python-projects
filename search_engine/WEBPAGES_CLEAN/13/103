      I am interested in the issues of creationism, evolution, and intelligent design. I feel that this topic is one of the most important topics in life. I personally believe that this universe and life were designed by an intelligent Creator, and that many hallmarks of design can be empirically found in nature.  
        Articles:</strong> 
         Fine-Tuned For Life  (February 2006): This article views fine-tuning as evidence for cosmological design.

         Project:</strong> 
         Analyzing The Origin Of Homochiality In Life : This paper was submitted as a final project for a statistics class (Math 131C) that I took in my 2nd year of undergrad. It discusses whether the feature of homochirality in life could be generated by chance.
