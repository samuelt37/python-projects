" PGraphite: An Experiment in Persistent Typed Object
Management " , by Jack C. Wileden, Alexander L. Wolf, Charles D.
Fisher, and Peri L. Tarr, in  Proceedings SIGSOFT 88: Third
Symposium on Software Development Environments (SDE3) 

  Abstract  

Defining, creating, and manipulating persistent typed objects will be
central activities in future software environments.  PGraphite is a
working prototype through which we are exploring the requirements for the
persistent object capability of an object management system in the Arcadia
software environment. PGraphite represents both a set of abstractions that
 a model for dealing with persistent objects in an environment and a
set of implementation strategies for realizing that model. PGraphite currently
provides a type definition mechanism for one important class of types, namely
directed graphs, and the automatic generation of Ada implementations for the
defined types, including their persistence capabilities.  We present
PGraphite, describe and motivate its model of persistence, outline the
implementation strategies that it embodies, and discuss some of our experience
with the current version of the system.
