				 About Me 
				 Dec 16, 2010 

				 I'm a PhD Candidate of  Department of Computer Science  at  UC Irvine . I started my study at 2008 after I had worked for Samsung Electronics as a System-on-Chip designer for more than 10 years, just because I want to challenge another life in USA. Although I had to give up my stabilized life in Korea, I've never regretted of my choice. I could make lots of friends, I could make fantastic experience at Southern California, and I could study! 

				 Challenge your life!
