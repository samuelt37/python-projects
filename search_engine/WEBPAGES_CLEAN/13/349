  Replicators : B0147/S1 

  B0147/S1 
and several related rules have a simple period-two c/2 replicator,
consisting of a block of two cells: 

     

 In  
B01347/S13 , two rows of replicators can be terminated by a pair
of cells to form a 4c/8 spaceship. 

     

 In  
B01347/S1 , there is a small breeder pattern that leaves behind
a trail of rows of replicators.
