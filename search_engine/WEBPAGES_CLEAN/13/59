    Goal:      

  The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic
principles of artificial intelligence. You will l  earn  some
 basic AI techniques, the problems for which they are applicable, and
their limitations.    

  The
course content is organized roughly around what are often considered to be
three central pillars of AI: Search, Logic, and Learning. Topics covered
include basic search, heuristic search, game search, constraint satisfaction,
knowledge representation, logic and inference, probabilistic modeling, and
machine learning algorithms.     

 

  

    Class Setup:      

  The
course will be primarily lecture-based.  
 There will be a Mid-term and a Final Exam.    On every other Thursdays before the
Mid-term Exam, and every other Tuesday after it, the first 20 minutes will be
an in-class pop quiz, followed by lecture (see specific dates in  Syllabus Overview  ).    The frequent quizzes are intended to
encourage you to stay current with the course material.     All exams and quizzes may cover all
material presented in class, including lectures and assigned textbook reading.     Quizzes will cover mostly material
presented since the last quiz, and also may include questions that many
students missed on the previous quiz.  
 The Final Exam will cover mostly material since the Mid-term Exam, and
also will include many questions intended to encourage you to remember the
earlier material (i.e., the Final Exam  will  be comprehensive).  Please
study the previous CS-171 quizzes and exams ( below ),
which are made available as study guides to help you learn and master the class
material; they are important guides about the performance that will be expected
from you now.      

       

  Homework
will be assigned, but is not graded. The reason is that prior student course
evaluations alerted me to the existence of student cheating by way of copying
the homework answers.    I deplore
this degree of personal degradation in dishonest students, but I cannot control
it, and so I avoid the opportunity.  
 I remain determined to create a fair and honest educational experience
for all students, as best I can.    

  There
will be an AI coding project (see  Project section 
below).    This is an individual or
pair project, i.e., you must do it entirely by yourself or form a team of two
people.     

  Sometimes teams do not work out.      Any team member may dissolve their team
at any time by so notifying the Instructor, TAs, and Tournament Director. Any
code written before the dissolution is “community property” which
may be used freely by both former team members. Any code written after the
dissolution is the sole property of the person who wrote it.    

  Please
note that you are encouraged to discuss concepts, methods, algorithms, etc.;
but  you are forbidden to
copy:  (1) source code from any source, or (2) text from any source
unless properly cited and set off as a quote.     Except for class materials provided from this class
website, you or your team must invent and write all of your own code by
yourself.    Except for properly
referenced material, you or your team must write all of your own project report
by yourself.     

  Please note that your source code and
project report are subject to analysis by automated plagiarism detection
programs, and that direct copying will be treated as an act of academic
dishonesty (please see the section on “ Academic
Honesty ” below).    

  Please start your AI coding project
earlier than you believe necessary, i.e., immediately; it will take longer and
be more difficult than you expect   ( as
is true of all coding projects everywhere at all times ).      

  All
the various CS-171 AI project shells were written by former CS-171 students who
became interested in AI and signed up for CS-199 in order to pursue their
interest and write more interesting AI project shells.    Please let me know if this is of
interest to you (CS-171 grade of A- or better required).    

  

   

    Textbook      

  Required:       Russell &amp;   Norvig    :  Artificial
Intelligence; A Modern Approach, 3 rd  edition.     

  The
course is based on, and the UCI bookstore has, the 3 rd  edition. The assigned
textbook reading is required, and is fair game for quizzes and exams.       You
place yourself at a distinct disadvantage if you do not have the textbook.        I expect that you have a personal copy
of the textbook, and quizzes and exams are written accordingly.       

  Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook for the quarter (and then resell it
back to the UCI Bookstore at the end if you don't want it for reference). 
   Please do not
jeopardize your precious educational experience with the false economy of trying
to save a few dollars by not having a personal copy of the textbook.        

  Also,
for your convenience, I have requested that a copy of the textbook be placed on
reserve in the UCI Science Library.    There is a two-hour check-out limit.  </strong>However,
please understand that with high student enrollments, it is unrealistic to
expect that these thin reserves always will be available when you need
them.     Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook. Otherwise, you are at a severe
disadvantage.        </strong> 

   I do deplore the high cost of modern
textbooks.    You may find the
textbook cheaper if you look online at sites such as eBay.com, Amazon.com,
etc.; or search the web for other sites related to the textbook.   </strong> 

 

  

    Grading:      

  Your grade
will be based on Discussion Section participation (10%)  , a coding project (20%)  , the four   quizzes (20%), a mid-term exam (25%), and a final exam
(25%).  
Homework is assigned but ungraded.    

       

   ·        
    Discussion Section is
REQUIRED and roll will be taken each period (10 periods = 1 period per week
over 10 weeks).   Each of the 10 periods counts as 1/10 of the 10% Discussion
Section Participation points. You may not leave after roll has been taken and before
the end of the period, i.e., it is not OK to show up for roll and then depart prematurely.    

   ·        
         

   ·        
    The AI coding project
will be a “Connect-K” AI agent.      “Dumb” coding shells are
available in C++, Java, and Python.  
 You must write the “smarts.” This is a solo or pair project
and you must do all of it all by yourself or with a single team-mate.    

                 You
are already behind schedule.   
 Start coding now.    More
details below in the Project section.   You
will lose 10% of your Project grade for every day or fraction thereof your
project submission is late.      

                Your
“Final AI” will be entered into a tournament against all of your
classmate’s Final AIs. The top 10% will have their Project score
increased by 10% (= 2% of total grade), the second 10% by 9%, the third 10% by
8%, and so on.    

   ·        
         

   ·        
    Quizzes will be given
the first 20 minutes of class every second Thursday before, and each second
Tuesday after, the Mid-term  Exam     (    dates are listed in the  Syllabus Overview  below), and are
closed-book, closed-notes.    Your
lowest quiz score will be discarded in computing your grade.     It is not possible to make-up missed
quizzes, but one missed quiz may be discarded as your lowest quiz score.     

   ·        
             

   ·        
    The Mid-term exam
will be given in class on Tuesday, 1 Nov.,   and is closed-book,
closed-notes.     It is not possible
to make-up a missed Mid-term exam.     

   ·        
         

   ·        
    The Final exam will
be given in class on Tuesday, 6 Dec., 4-6pm,   and is closed-book,
closed-notes.    The Final exam will
cover  all course material from the entire quarter , with emphasis on the
second half.     It is not possible
to make-up a missed Final exam.     

         

  I honor all requests made by the  UCI Disability Services Center .    

       

  Also, I make exceptions for:    

                *
 genuine  medical conditions ( I require a signed note
from your doctor on official letterhead ),    

                *
 births/deaths  in the family ( I require a copy of
the birth/death certificate ),    

                *
 jury  duty or other court proceedings ( I require a
copy of your jury service papers or other official court documents ), or    

                *
field maneuvers of the US military or National Guard ( I require a copy of
your official orders ).    

   ·        
             

   ·        
     Every student who fills out a course evaluation
for CS-171 will receive a bonus of 1% added to their final grade, free and
clear, off the curve, simply a bonus.         

            EEE will
return to me the names of students who fill out evaluations (but not the
content, which remains anonymous), provided that enough students fill out
evaluations so that anonymity is not compromised.    I will add 1% free bonus to the final
grade of each such named student.  

            Student
course evaluations are very important to me for monitoring and improving the
course content, and very important to UCI for evaluating our success at our
educational mission.    *Please* fill
out your student course evaluations.    

       

   ·        
    “Bonus
Points”  
will be awarded, at my sole discretion, (1) to the first student who spots  a genuine technical error 
(minor typos don’t count) in any of the course materials before I spot it
too, and (2)  for helpful
contributions  to the class as we go along.    One bonus point is equivalent to one
quiz point.    

       

  Your Bonus Points, if any, should be visible to you in EEE  GradeBook . If for some reason you have been awarded a Bonus
Point, but you did not get a notification from me or it did not appear in EEE  GradeBook , please do not hesitate to send an email message
to me as a reminder.    

         

 

  

    Study Habits:      

       

  This course is technical, rigorous,
and demanding. You will be expected to learn and master a large body of
technical material in a very short period of time. You must demonstrate your
mastery by (1) accurate performance on frequent quizzes and exams, and (2)
successful implementation of an AI coding project.    

  I
deliberately treat you as adults who are responsible for your own educational
decisions, and so Lecture is optional.  Discussion Section is required and roll will be taken, 
because it is part of our educational mission to train our TAs to become future
professors. Nevertheless, students who do not attend Lecture are at a serious
disadvantage and do not succeed as well in this class.    Students who spend Lectures and
Discussion Section sleeping, on cell phones, surfing the Web, or on social
media are wasting their time and might as well be absent.    Such students send me email messages to
ask questions that already were covered thoroughly and in detail during Lecture
and once again in Discussion Section.  
 On quizzes and exams, they miss points that already have been covered
thoroughly.    

   Your
educational moments are precious, and your education now will be the single
most important factor in your future career success or failure.    Please, make the most of your precious
educational moments now. Please, attend both Lecture and Discussion Section,
pay attention, ask questions, and master the material.       

  Please
do not ever fall behind in the class material; instead,  study frequently and
diligently . Please begin your AI coding project earlier than you believe
necessary; it will take longer and be more difficult than you expect ( as is
true of all coding projects everywhere at all times ).    

  Please
work harder and study longer.  
 Please understand thoroughly all class material, and ask questions when
you do not understand.    Please
attend all lectures and discussion sections.    Please come to lectures and discussion
sections prepared with questions about any material that is not clear.    Please do all assigned reading, both
before and again after lecture. Please review the lecture notes, several times
over, both before and again after lecture, until you understand every detail.
Please regularly attend office hours with me and the TA. Please ask questions
about any class material that is not absolutely crystal clear.    

  Please
 work and understand all past quizzes and exams; they are important guides
about the performance that will be expected from you now.  Please work and
understand all the optional homework.    

  Please
 OVERSTUDY!!

    Syllabus:      

  The following represents a preliminary syllabus. Some changes in the
lecture sequence may occur due to earthquakes, fires, floods, wars, natural
disasters, unnatural disasters, or the discretion of the instructor based on
class progress.    

  Background Reading and Lecture Slides will be changed or revised as the
class progresses at the discretion of the instructor.    Please note:    I often tweak or revise the lecture
slides prior to or after the lecture; please ensure that you have the current
version.    

  Please read the assigned textbook reading and review the lecture notes  in advance  of each lecture, then  again after  each lecture.

     Alan
Turing’s classic paper on AI (1950)   .    

                 Alan
Turing is the most famous computer scientist of all time.   

                 The
Turing Award is the highest honor in computer science.   

   The Turing Machine is
still our fundamental theoretical model of computation.   

   Turing’s work on the
Enigma code in WWII led to programmable computers.

                                        “The

technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed
human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending
civilization in an event called the singularity.”

                                                    “Abstract:       Within thirty years,
we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly
after, the human era will be ended.  
 Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided
so that we may survive?    These
questions are investigated. Some possible answers (and some further dangers)
are presented.”    

                                                    “....
Just so I'm not guilty of a relative-time ambiguity, let me more specific: I'll
be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030....”    

       

                             Rumors,  and rumors of rumors.    Skeptics, including me, point out that
the design-implement-test-debug loop includes a necessarily slow
implement-test-debug step that cannot, at least in the foreseeable future, be
reduced by faster computation. On the other hand, perhaps in the unforeseeable future
fast and perfect computational simulation could eliminate that slow
implement-test-debug step?  You be the judge.    ;-)

Search in Interplanetary Trajectory Design , courtesy of Eric  Trumbauer , former CS-271 student and Aero/Astro PhD
student.     

                           
               Dr.
 Trumbauer  comments, “One thing to possibly
discuss with the last slide is that the itinerary it settles on does stay at a
higher energy for a little bit until it passes closest to Europa, maximizing
the velocity before the insertion sequence to the lower energy.    This is indeed optimal behavior, as
opposed to immediately reducing its energy as a Greedy Best First algorithm using
this heuristic would want to do.”

Lathrop comments, “The A* algorithm found and proved many global optimum
solutions for the difficult and important real-world problem of protein
structure prediction from sequence  within two hours  in search spaces
sizes as large as 10^20 to 10^30, which are search space sizes totally and
completely inaccessible to blind search methods.”

                                         The
program learns to build a car using a genetic algorithm. If you let this
program run for a long time (&gt;&gt; 30 generations), you will see that
eventually it produces cars well suited to the terrain.     

                                         This
outcome illustrates a general theme of genetic algorithms: very, very slow;
but, eventually, good performance. After all, it took ~3.6 billion years to
evolve humans from bacteria ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolutionary_history_of_life ).     

                                         Please
note that this eventual good performance of genetic algorithms is conditional
upon a representation that allows good solutions to sub-problems to be combined
simply, by cross-over, into a globally good solution; if the vector position of
the features is completely randomized within the chromosome, any such good
performance is lost.

   Your project is to code
a “Connect-K” agent.        

         

         

   Project Coding Shells:         

   Student resources are
available  here ,
including:     

   v        General documentation and background
info.     

   v        A C++ shell.     

   v        A Java shell.     

   v        A Python shell.     

   v        A tournament shell.     

   We will fix any further
problems and issue new shells as necessary. Please watch for and download any
new shells, then discard your old shells. You can keep any “smart”
code you have written, just put it into the new shells.     

                 “Dumb”
coding shells are available in C++, Java, and Python.    You must write the “smarts.”
To help you get started, we also have released the source code to “ RandomAI ,” and the executables to  RandomAI ,
 PoorAI ,  AverageAI , and  GoodAI  (they go by different names in different shells).             Your
final AI will compete in a tournament against all your classmates for extra
credit bonus points (the top 10% will get 10 Bonus points, the second 10% will
get 9,  the  third 10% will get 8, and so on).  This is a solo or pair project
and you must do all of it all by yourself or with one partner.      

                 As
noted in lecture, all of my CS-171 project shells were written by former CS-171
students (grade of A- or better required) who wanted to go further and do

   Project Deadlines and Regulations:         

   ·        
     Project
deadlines are given above in the “ Syllabus
Overview and Important Dates ” section.     

   ·        
     Your EEE  DropBox  submission must be a single “zipped”
file named “ yourLastName_yourUCINumericID_yourTeamName .”     NO SPACES OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL UNIX
CHARACTER  in  yourTeamName . Please restrict your  TeamName  to characters, digits, hyphen, and underscore, or
else you may lose points.     

   ·        
     It should have three
subdirectories:  src , bin, &amp; doc; for source,
executable, and documents ( ‘doc’
must contain your Project Report ).     

   ·        
     Your main AI file must
contain the string “AI” and no other file may contain the string
“AI” (case is ignored, i.e., “ ai ”
== “AI”).     

   You will lose 10% of
your project score for each day (or part thereof) that your project is late for
any deadline. Please submit your project early, well ahead of the deadline, and
avoid the last-minute rush. If system problems, web congestion, or other
unavoidable Internet delays make your project late, it is still late and will
be penalized.      

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

             

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    Study Guides --- Previous CS-171 Tests:        

  Previous
CS-171 Quizzes, Mid-term exams, and Final exams are available here as study
guides.    

       

  As an
incentive to study this material, at least one question from a previous Quiz or
Exam will appear on every new Quiz or Exam. In particular, questions that many
students missed are likely to appear again. If you missed a question, please
study it carefully and learn from your mistake --- so that if it appears again,
you will understand it perfectly.    

       

  Please note
that some of the very old tests below reflect different textbooks that may
define some things differently than does your current textbook. In case of
conflict, your current textbook is deemed correct and will prevail. Some of
your visualization systems may not display the red PDF overlays used to correct
errors in very old tests. For example, in problems #2a, #2c, #3a, and #3b on
Quiz #2 from SQ’2004, the PDF overlay is invisible on a Mac (iPad), and
possibly on some other systems or printers.    The PDF overlays just do not seem to
work as advertised (sorry!!), but this problem seems only to afflict very old
tests (i.e., from over a decade ago). If you are confused by any of the answers
below, please bring your questions to the TA in Discussion Section
(required).    If you find a genuine
error anywhere, please send me email and you will receive a Bonus Point if
correct.    

       

  Also, a
student has recommended ‘quizlet.com’ as a good online study
resource. While I cannot vouch for it, apparently it contains several good
study aids for your textbook.

    Academic Honesty:         

   Academic dishonesty is unacceptable
and will not be tolerated at the University of California, Irvine. It is the responsibility
of each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic honesty policies.
Please take the time to read the current  UCI
Academic Senate Policy  On  Academic Integrity  and
the  ICS
School Policy on Academic Honesty .   

   The
policies in these documents will be adhered to scrupulously. Any student who
engages in cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, or collusion in
dishonest activities, will receive an academic evaluation of ``F'' for the
entire course, with a letter of explanation to the student's permanent file.
The  ICS Student Affairs
Office  will be involved at every step of the process. Dr. Lathrop seeks to
create a level playing field for all students.
