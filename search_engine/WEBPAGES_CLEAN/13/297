    Course Goals 

 This course covers selected topics in advanced database research. Its
content may somewhat differ in each offering though there may be significant
overlap between any two offerings. If you are not sure whether you can take the
course for grade or not (in case you have done so in the past), please check
with the instructor. This quarter we will focus on middleware &amp; data
management for pervasive applications. Specifically, we will concentrate on
data collection component of pervasive system design. Pervasive systems
instrument variety of sensors to monitor the state of the environment and
subjects immersed in the environment. Such monitoring is necessary in itself
(as in surveillance applications) or for providing pervasive functionalities to
individuals.  � While the possibility of
building large scale pervasive environments has been the dream of technologists
for a while now, recent advances  � in
multimedia, stream data management, sensors, networking has brought us to a point
that many now feel that the dream will soon be a reality. However, now that
large scale pervasive spaces might be a reality, many new challenges have
emerged � an example of which is privacy and security concerns. This class will
introduce some of the key ideas important for developing pervasive
applications. The class will be very project driven. At UCI we have created a
campus level instrumented space � which we refer to as a  Responsphere 
� that has all the necessary hardware to build and test pervasive applications.
These include variety of sensors deployed all over the campus, network and
storage infrastructure. Also, we have an initial prototype framework for
building a multimedia streaming and analysis component that can function as a
data collection and manipulation system for a pervasive space. Students will read
&amp; present the state-of-the-art research papers, write short summaries, and work
on a specific project to add functionality to the multimedia streaming system.
The development will be guided by the larger goal of building one (or more)
pervasive applications at the campus level. Examples include  a 
intelligent surveillance system, technology enhanced campus services, etc. 

 Instructor and Office Hours 

 Professor  Sharad   Mehrotra ,
Calit2 Building , ,  949-824-1623,    sharad       � AT ics.uci.edu   
Office Hours: By appointments.    

 Working in Groups 

 Students are encouraged to form a group to read/discuss papers, give
presentations, and do the course project. Each group should have at most 2
students. If you want to form a group of 3, please talk to the instructor
first.    

 Course Requirements 

 The course includes paper readings, class presentations and discussions, and
a final project.  

   Paper Readings :  
  We will provide a list of papers to
read.  Before a paper is presented in class (including those
papers presented by the instructor), each group  must  read it.  

     Problem
     Sets   
  We may have a few problem sets to
motivate students to understand the details of papers. 

     Project :
      
  Each group needs to complete a
research-oriented project. The details of the project will be  posted  � on  the class
web page and discussed in class.

 For all the graded assignments (reading and problem sets), if you disagree
with the grading, you can discuss with me within two weeks after I return the  homeworks . After that, all the grades will be finalized.    

 Prerequisites 

 Students should have the background of basic database knowledge, and have
taken ICS184 and ICS214. In addition, students should know how to program in
languages such as C, C++, or Java.    

 Time and Place (Tentative) 

 The class meets on Wednesday, 9.15 to 11.45 am, Location: 4348 Calit2
building ET 

   Textbooks 

  Most of the materials for the
     class will be from recent conferences. So there is no required textbook
     for the course.  
    Electronic Lists 

   Class mailing list : An
     email list has been setup to include the email addresses of all the
     enrolled students. We will use it to send out announcements. 
   Email help : Send
     emails to the instructor ( sharad  + AT +
     ics.uci.edu) for questions.
