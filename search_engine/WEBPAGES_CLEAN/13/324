 AND/OR Branch-and-Bound Search for Pure 0/1 Integer Linear Programming Problems 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
AND/OR search spaces have recently been introduced as a unifying
paradigm for advanced algorithmic schemes for graphical models. The main
virtue of this representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which
can translate into exponential time savings for search algorithms. In this paper we
extend the recently introduced AND/OR Branch-and-Bound algorithm (AOBB)
[1] for solving pure 0/1 Integer Linear Programs [2]. Since the variable selection
can have a dramatic impact on search performance, we introduce a new dynamic
AND/OR Branch-and-Bound algorithm able to accommodate variable ordering
heuristics. The effectiveness of the dynamic AND/OR approach is demonstrated
on a variety of benchmarks for pure 0/1 integer programming, including instances
from the MIPLIB library, real-world combinatorial auctions and random uncapacitated
warehouse location problems.
