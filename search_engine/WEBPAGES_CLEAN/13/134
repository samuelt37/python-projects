The algorithm was evaluated on two public domain, realworld data sets (on the medical domains of  dermatology  and breast cancer). 1 Introduction This work presents a system based on genetic algorithms (GAs) to perform the task of classification. The system is       Rafael S. Parpinelli and Heitor S. Lopes and Alex Alves Freitas.

((96.04 -- 95.02)/(100 -- 95.02) = 0.20) On the other hand, C4.5 discovered rules with a better accuracy rate than AntMiner in the other two data sets. In one data set,  Dermatology   the difference was quite small, whereas in the Tic-tac-toe the difference was relatively large. (This result will be revisited later.) Overall one can conclude that
