virtual OEBondBase *NewBond(OEAtomBase *src, OEAtomBase *dst,
                            unsigned int order=0)
    
Create a new bond.  The ``src'', ``dst'' and ``order'' arguments are used to
specify the begin atom, the end atom and the bond order of the new
bond.  This method returns a pointer to the newly created bond.  The
atoms specified as begin and end atoms must belong to the current
molecule.  Additionally, a NULL pointer, (OEAtomBase*)0, may be passed
as either the begin or end atom (but not both), allowing that atom to
be specified later using OEBondBase::SetBgn or OEBondBase::SetEnd
respectively.  This helps when creating molecules for applications in
which the ordering of atoms and/or bonds is significant.

  
After creating new bonds, it may be necessary to call the
 OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds  and  OEAssignAromaticFlags  functions
to update the ``in ring'' and ``aromatic'' properties of the atoms and
bonds in the modified molecule.
