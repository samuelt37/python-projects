In detail, pairwise two-tailed t-tests indicate that there are seven data sets (cleveland, diabetes,  ionosphere   liver, sonar, waveform21, and waveform40) where NeC4.5 with � = 0% is significantly more accurate than C4.5, while there is no significant difference on the       Hyunsoo Kim and Se Hyun Park.
