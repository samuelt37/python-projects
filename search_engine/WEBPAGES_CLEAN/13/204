			    Information is used for implementing all decisions and is essential for communication and making systems work.  On the other hand, decision-making requires insights resulting from observation and analysis of all relevant data and information from multiple sources.  By using computers and users synergistically as a system, a very different type of computing environment, experiential environments, could be developed. Experiential environments allow a user to directly observe data and information of interest related to an event and to interact with the data based on his interests in the context of that event.
