1. In a binary search tree formed by inserting n &gt; 2 different values in
a random permutation without rebalancing, what is the probability that
the node for the median value has exactly one child node? (Hint: this
event depends only on the relative order of insertion of the median
value and its two closest neighbors in the sorted sequence of inputs.)


2. Give pseudocode for an algorithm range(T,l,r) that answers queries
where the inputs to the query are the root node T of a binary search
tree and two numbers l and r, and the output is a collection of all the
keys x_i in T with l
