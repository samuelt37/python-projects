bool Init(const char *smarts)
    
This method (re)initializes an OEMCSSearch instance using a SMARTS
pattern.  The smarts pattern is parsed to create a query molecule
available for maximum common subgraph matching.  The method will
return true if initialization completes successfully, and false upon
failure.  Prior state information is cleared before initialization,
and is lost even if the method fails to initialize properly.

  
    
bool Init(const OEQMolBase &amp;qmol)
    
This method (re)initializes an OEMCSSearch instance using a query
molecule (OEQMolBase) reference.  The method will return true if
initialization completes successfully, and false upon failure.  Prior
state information is cleared before initialization, and is lost even
if the method fails to initialize properly.

  
    
bool Init(const OEMolBase &amp;mol, unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
    
This method (re)initializes an OEMCSSearch instance using a molecule
(OEMolBase) and expression options used to convert the molecule into a
query molecule (OEQMolBase).  The atom and bond expression options
passed as the second and third arguments to the method are defined in
the OEExprOpts namespace.  Expression options are used to convert
the atom and bond data into expression trees which are used during the
common subgraph search.  The method will return true if initialization
completes successfully, and false upon failure.  Prior state
information is cleared before initialization, and is lost even if the
method fails to initialize properly.
