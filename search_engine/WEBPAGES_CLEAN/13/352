   Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1866 .   J. Computational Geometry  2 (1): 144â€“182, 2011 .
 
Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a  Manhattan orbifold  and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L 1  plane.
