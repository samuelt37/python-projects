   Final Thoughts  
 
This dissertation offers a path that, if followed, helps address
software development problems for which uncertainty plays an
important role, specifically with respect to human judgment
and decision making.  We strongly believe that software
uncertainty modeling - using Bayesian belief networks -
will help managers to better plan, schedule, estimate, and evaluate
software projects.  It will also help developers to better trace
and navigate interrelated artifacts in large software spaces,
understand and discover system qualities and properties, and,
ultimately, achieve better judgment and make better decisions.
