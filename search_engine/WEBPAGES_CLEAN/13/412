  Description and
Objectives    

 Stat200C is the last of a three-quarter series on intermediate
probability and statistical theory. The objective of this course is to develop
the theoretical basis of statistical methods for linear models. 

     

  Meeting times and
location : 2:00-3:20am on Monday and Wednesday @ �  DBH1423 

  Office hours :
2-3pm on Thursday or by appointments 

  Discussion : TBA

highly recommended:    

 Seber, G.A., and Lee, A.J. (2003).
Linear regression analysis (2 nd  edition). Wiley Interscience.     

  Reference Texts:

  Grading    

 The grade is based upon about seven homework assignments
(30%), a midterm (30%) and a final exam (40%). No late homework will be
accepted.  

     

  Important Dates    

 Monday, May 2 (tentatively): midterm 

 Wednesday, June 8: final 

 Both the midterm and the final are closed-book and in-class.
The final exam will cover the material presented in 200C.  

       

  Prerequisites    

 Statistics 200B (or equivalent), or permission from
instructor. Students are assumed to be familiar with linear algebra, basic
properties of multivariate distribution, and basic convergence theorems of
random variables. Prior exposure to applied linear regression is also
desirable.
