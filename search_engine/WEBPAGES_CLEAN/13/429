  COMPUTER AIDED GEOMETRIC DESIGN 
 Special Issue on Medical Volume Modeling and Visualizaton 

 High quality scientific papers that 
focus on medical modeling and visualization in three dimensions are sought 
for a special issue of  the journal
of Computer Aided Geometric Design.  
A submitted paper may be either theoretical or 
experimental; research surveys will also be considered.

  Typical, but not exclusive, topics include

   Algorithms of three dimensional segmentation, reconstruction,
visualization techniques for CT, MRI and PET images
  Optimization of sampling strategies for volume image acquisition
  Co-registration of multiple image modalities
  Motion analysis and time dependent visualizations
  Elastic anatomical models and deformations
  Representation issues of anatomical, physiological information
   The submission deadline is January 31, 1997.  Submissions should be
prepared following the standard practices of the journal and should be
sent to the guest editor, Chandrajit Bajaj, Department of Computer
Sciences, 1398 CS Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana
47907-1398, USA,
 bajaj@cs.purdue.edu  If you are
considering the submission of a paper or require additional information,
please contact the guest editor.  Electronic submission (postscript or
pdf) is acceptable.  All submissions will be refereed following the
normal practices of the journal.
