 Property attributes<body>

  Property attributes  
      At present, the spec. defines two XML attributes, �live� and �readonly� which are used with the &lt;Prop&gt; tag to describe the characteristics of the property.
 
     Pro: returning the attributes with each property allows the behavior of a property to vary from resource to resource
 
     Con: live and readonly properties are typically the same across an entire server
 
  passing these attributes takes up extra octets on the wire
