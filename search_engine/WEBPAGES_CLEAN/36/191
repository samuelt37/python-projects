We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

We show that, for any n, there exists a mechanism formed by connecting
polygons with hinges that can be folded into all possible n-ominos.
Similar results hold as well for n-iamonds, n-hexes, and n-abolos.

    Regular labelings and geometric structures . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1007.0221 . 
Invited to 22nd Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG 2010). 
Invited to  Proc. 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation
(ISAAC 2010) , Jeju, Korea, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6506, 2010, p. 1 .  
We survey regular labelings for straight-line embedding of planar graphs
on grids, rectangular partitions, and  orthogonal polyhedra , and the many
similarities between these different types of labeling.

    Near-linear-time deterministic plane Steiner spanners and TSP
approximation for well-spaced point sets .  G. Borradaile  and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1206.2254 .  24th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG 2012) ,

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We show how to use invertible Bloom filters as part of range searching
data structures that determine the differences between the members of two
sets that lie in a given query range.

For every positive integer  n , there exists a set of  n 
points on a parabola, with the property that every  n -vertex
planar graph can be drawn without crossings with its vertices at these
points and with its edges drawn as circular arcs.

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.
  
    Maximizing the sum of radii of disjoint balls or disks . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1607.02184 .  Proc. 28th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry , Vancouver, BC,
Canada, 2016.  
We show how to find a system of disjoint balls with given centers,
maximizing the sum of radius of the balls. Our algorithm takes cubic
time in arbitrary metric spaces and can be sped up to subquadratic time
in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension.
