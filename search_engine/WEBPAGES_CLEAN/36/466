 Undergraduate double majoring 

 
 

  Double Major Overview</strong> 
 You can apply to double major through the Change of Major option with the Applications section of Student Access. 
 Students will have an easier time double majoring if you plan out your four or five year plan with both majors in mind. Create a preliminary schedule of classes first, then have a Academic Counselor or Peer Advisor review the schedule to make sure there are no conflicts. This four or five year plan will change as class offerings change from year to year, however, you will still have a better idea of what classes you will be taking than if you had just taken them without any forethought. This process will be mandatory if you are entering your third quarter, are a transfer, or if you have already accumilated over 90 units (not including units acquired outside of UCI.)  
 Keep in mind that some majors such as Biology require that you graduate within four years regardless of single or double majors. You may wish to do a Second Baccalaureate instead.

 Special Programs and Learning Opportunities 
 
			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential 
learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will 
help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor, 
or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other 
campus programs and resources that support your interests and future 
goals.
			   
    »</strong>  CONCENTRATIONS:</strong> 
    Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context</strong>   
All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan 
that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other 
requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe. 
 
The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services
 and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in 
multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive 
international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the 
concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the
 history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside
 the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international 
host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host 
country.
 
 Application:</strong> 
Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a 
guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be 
approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student
 Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a 
high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic 
counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education 
regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to 
internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic 
counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified 
students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as 
needed.   Requirements:</strong>    A
 minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an 
emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), 
history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international
 portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, 
global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and 
global economics;   
  A
 one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major 
and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an 
international university;  
  A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.  
  
    »</strong>  MINORS</strong>
 
Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue
 a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student 
well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or
 discipline.  Note:  Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the 
student’s major requirements.  Some major/minor combinations are not 
allowed.
 
   Biomedical Computing (10 courses)  
  Informatics (8 courses)  
  Information and Computer Science (7 courses)  
  Statistics (7 courses)  
     »</strong>  OPPORTUNITIES FOR HONORS-LEVEL STUDY</strong> 
Students who are majoring in Biomedical Computing, Business Information 
Management, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, and 
Information and Computer Science, and ICS Undeclared Pre-Majors are 
invited to apply for admission to the Bren School of ICS's introductory 
honors sequence (ICS H21/H22/H23).  These courses provide a uniquely 
challenging and intimate learning environment in which conventional 
course material is explored in greater depth.
   
   A student must meet at least one of the following criteria to be eligible to enroll in ICS H21: 
 
  Minimum 620 on each of 2 of 3 sections of the SAT; or 
 Member of the UCI Campuswide Honors Program; or 
 Verification of score of 3 or higher on AP Computer Science A exam; or 
  
Eligible students will be provided an authorization code (required) for 
course enrollment at the time of their summer orientation/registration 
session.
    »</strong>  BREN SCHOOL OF ICS HONORS PROGRAM </strong>   
              Allows juniors and seniors majoring in Computer Science, 
Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, or Information and 
Computer Science to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. 
 Students admitted to the program participate in an honors seminar, 
conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, and
 write a research paper.  
 More information about eligibility criteria and benefits of successful completion of the honors program is available at the  Honors program web site .  
    »</strong>  INDEPENDENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES</strong>   
              The School encourages all majors to take advantage of this
 valuable experience, and faculty advertise many research opportunities 
every year.  
 Students are also encouraged to participate in the campus  Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ,
 which offers guidance and grant funding for student-proposed 
independent research, and sponsors programs which provide summer 
stipends for students working on faculty-guided research. 
    »</strong>  CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM</strong>   
              Available to selected high-achieving students from all 
academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more 
information see the  CHP web site .  
    »</strong>  EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM</strong>  
              Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience
 different cultures while making progress toward degree objectives 
through the  Education Abroad Program (EAP) .  
 EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world.
