        Simpler than Rose. Avoids Roseï¿½s property sheet problems.

 

         Several UI elements support a design-and-code task

 

         Tree widget serves many purposes, but there is still only one table-of-contents view

 

         Diagram editing good, but some usability problems

 

      It is much to hard to drag a class

  Arc editing is very good

  No alignment or back-to-front ordering

  No way to lock a given toolbar mode

         Audit and Metrics tools provide some knowledge support, but they must be explicitly invoked, and their feedback is unmanageable.
