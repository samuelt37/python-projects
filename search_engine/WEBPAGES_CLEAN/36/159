 KDD Cup 1999 Data  

  Abstract 
 This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.
