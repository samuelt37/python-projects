       Economics 11 / ICS 11</strong>  The Internet and Public Policy</strong>  Winter quarter 2017, TuTh 2:00-3:20pm</strong> 
       The course will focus on  3 case studies</strong> concerning the federal government’s role in  regulating and encouraging the Internet that illustrate how technology,  economics, politics and law are combined to form public policy -- 
         Privacy</strong> – What parts of your Internet traffic should your ISP or cell phone provider be allowed to collect, and how should it be be able to use it? What type of consent should be required? 
          Copyright Infringement</strong>– Should law make it more difficult for peer-to-peer file sharing users to find copyrighted music and video files? Are these measures effective? 
          Net  Neutrality &amp; Throttling</strong> – Should your ISP or cell phone provider be allowed to throttle some types of Internet traffic, e.g. video or music? What if you receive a discount for a plan that throttles traffic in this manner? 
        In order to address these case studies, you’ll also learn some  basics about the Internet, economics, and law -- 
         Learn how  the Internet works</strong> – How does your computer find where a webserver is  located? What do those IP numbers mean? How do packets find their way? How does  the Internet control how fast you can send? What was Senator Ted Stevens  talking about when he called the Internet a “series of tubes”? 
          Learn  basic microeconomics</strong> – How do consumers decide how much to buy? How do  companies decide how much to sell? How are prices chosen? How can monopolies  manipulate prices to maximize profit? Why do you have more choices for wireless  providers than for wired phone providers? 
          Learn how  telephone, wireless, cable tv, and the Internet are regulated</strong> – Are there  limits to what your telephone and cable companies can charge? Why can’t you  purchase only the cable channels you want? Is your Internet provider allowed to  look inside all your packets to see what you are doing on the Internet? 
         Course overlap:</strong> The economics material overlaps with Econ 20A, 100A, and 100B. The Internet architecture material overlaps with CS 132 and EECS 148. Students who have taken any of these courses may still take Econ 11 / ICS 11, since they will find the remaining material to be new and challenging.  (Note: This means that this course will be challenging for Econ and BusEcon majors, regardless of what counselors may have told you ...)</strong> 
        Degree requirement  credit:</strong> You can choose to count the course toward General Education requirements  under  either category II (Science and  Technology) or category III (Social and Behavioral Sciences)</strong> but not both. (Note: The General Education requirements apply to students who entered UCI Fall 2008 or later. Students who entered earlier may fulfill either the Breadth requirements in the catalogue at the time they entered UCI, or the new General Education requirements. Please consult your student affairs office for details.) This course may or may not count toward major requirements; please consult your student affairs office for details.
