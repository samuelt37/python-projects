 The Impact of AND/OR Search Spaces on Constraint
Satisfaction and Counting 

 Rina Dechter and Robert Mateescu 

 
 Abstract  
The contribution of this paper is in demonstrating the impact of AND/OR
search spaces view on solutions counting. In contrast to the traditional (OR)
search space view, the AND/OR search space displays independencies present in
the graphical model explicitly and may sometimes reduce the search space exponentially.
Empirical evaluation focusing on counting demonstrates the spectrum
of search and inference within the AND/OR search spaces.
