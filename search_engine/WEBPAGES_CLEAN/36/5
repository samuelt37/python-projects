&gt;&gt; - I don't know if there exists a file system in which a file and a
&gt;&gt; directory can have exactly the same name, and are distinguished by the fact
&gt;&gt; that one is a directory and the other is a file. I mean, if it were
&gt;&gt; possible for a directory to have both a file and a directory called
&gt;&gt; file.html, then the URL:
&gt;&gt;       http://host/dir/file.html/1.5 
&gt;&gt; would be ambiguous. If there is such a perverted file system, I will
&gt;&gt; withdraw my points and leave to become a goatherd in Sardinia (Italy).
&gt;
&gt;Well the Thoth operating system from the university of waterloo
&gt;allowed a node in the filesystem to contain both data and links
&gt;to subnodes.  So a "directory" could be opened and read as a
&gt;file, or it could be traversed to find subdirs.  I understand
&gt;that the weather in Italy is very nice ;-)

Gennargentu, Sardinia, Italy. A wonderful scenery of peaceful rural
activities surrounds you. A dog barks happily far away, an army of animal
lawn mowers keep the immense grass field around you perfectly trimmed,
unspecified ovine smells fill the place (watch your steps!). A clearly
clumsy apprentice shepherd sits under a pear tree smiling at you and offers
some goat cheese. He says:

"Uh. Is it really SO bad? Heck, this could be the end of the civilization
as we know it. The entire proposal of path overspecification of resources
goes bust. I mean, not just for version management, but even for cgi
applications and such."
