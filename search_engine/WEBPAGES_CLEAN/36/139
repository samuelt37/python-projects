 UCI  ICS 1C , Homework 1 
 Labs of 7-12 August 1996 

 
By  12 August , you and all members of your team are expected to be 
able to do all the things outlined below.  We will do the formal
check-off late Wednesday and early Monday, 7 and 12 August.

  The first thing to do is to read this entire assignment
before beginning work on any part of the parts given below.

   Basic skills you will need on the Macintosh: 
   World-Wide Web via Netscape 
      
    You should be able to handle (and understand) the nine picture-buttons
    along the top of the Netscape window, as well as the following features
    accessible through Netscape's menus.
      File: Concentrate on  New Web Browser, Open Location, Save As ;
      Edit:  Find...  and  Find Again ;
      View: everything;
      Go: everything;
      Bookmarks: everything, with special attention to building
        your own collection of bookmarks.
        You may wish to begin
        with choices such as the following:
         
         http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/  
         
         http://www.uci.edu/  
         
         http://www.summer.uci.edu/~summer/  
         
         http://www.oac.uci.edu/  
         
         http://www.oac.uci.edu/computing/  
         
         http://www.w3.org/  
         
         http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/  
         
         http://www.yahoo.com/  
         
         http://www.yahoo.com/education/universities/  
         
         http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate  
         
         http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phwww  
          Options: Concentrate on  Show Toolbar, Show Location, 
      Show Directory Buttons, Auto Load Images ;
      Window: You need to use the  Bookmarks  window to
       manipulate your own collection of bookmarks:
          Organize your bookmarks in folders which you create.
           Move bookmarks between folders, 
           Give bookmarks and bookmark folders reasonable,
             descriptive names.
           Save your bookmark collection in a file on your floppy
             disk and use Netscape to view the contents of that file.
           Import bookmarks and delete unwanted ones.
            Help:  Handbook  is worth exploring a bit.
       
    The most important things here are
        to become familiar with the various options, 
       to start building your own personal bookmark list, and 
       to be able to use the  Open Location  fluently.
       NOTE:  You must position the mouse inside
    type-in windows such as
     Open Location  and  Find .  You can click the mouse
    or use the arrows to reposition the cursor within the window, 
    but  (beware)  the Macintosh  delete 
    key deletes to the  left  of where the cursor is within
    the window.  So to edit strings in type-in windows, one typically
     must  use a button click or arrow keys to position the cursor
    to the  left  of where the insertion is to be made or to the 
     right  of a desired deletion.)

     Preserving and Restoring your Netscape Bookmarks 
      Save your bookmarks to a file on a floppy disk and then
    use Netscape to view that file.
    Next, remove all
    bookmarks from the currently running copy of Netscape,
    exit Netscape, restart it, and import your bookmarks from
    the file in which you saved them on your floppy disk.

     Fetch 
      
    You should know how to transfer files both ways between the Macintosh
    and your account on  ea.oac.uci.edu  or  orion.oac.uci.edu 
    You should be familiar with choosing the
    directory for the source and destination files in both places.
      Open Connection to  ea.oac.uci.edu  or
	   orion.oac.uci.edu 
        Get File (in Text mode) to move files from  ea.oac.uci.edu  or
	   orion.oac.uci.edu 
          to the Macintosh.
        Put File (in Text mode) to move files from the Macintosh
          to  ea.oac.uci.edu  or  orion.oac.uci.edu .
        Close Connection
         NCSA Telnet 
      You should be able to connect and login to  ea.oac.uci.edu  or
     orion.oac.uci.edu 

     Editing Text Files 
      For this class,
     Simple Text  is the basic text editor on the Macintosh.

   Basic skills you will need on ea.oac.uci.edu or orion.oac.uci.edu: 
   E-mail with
   Pine : 
   (Here's where you know you need to work with your fellow team
  members.) 
      
      
       
	Compose  and 
       
	send  new e-mail messages.
        
       
	Read ,
       reply
        to ,
       
	forward , and
       
	refile  ( "Save" ) e-mail messages you receive.
         Export an e-mail message you receive to the file system 
        (i.e., copy it to a file on  ea.oac.uci.edu  or
         orion.oac.uci.edu.)
        Include into an e-mail message you send the contents of a file
        read in from the file system (i.e., a file on  ea.oac.uci.edu 
	or  orion.oac.uci.edu )
        using Pine's  "Read File"  function.
        Create and update an e-mail 
         
	address book  of the names an e-mail addresses of those with whom
	you are likely to correspond (e.g., members of your ICS 1C team).
           File and directory operations: 
      
       ls (list a directory),
         mv (move/rename a file or directory)
         cp (copy a file)
         rm (remove/delete a file)
        create and edit --  pico  
        is the recommended editor for class use on  ea.oac.uci.edu  or
	 orion.oac.uci.edu .
