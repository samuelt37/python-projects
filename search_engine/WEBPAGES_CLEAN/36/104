                  HelpOnEditing  &gt; HelpOnLists           This page helps if you are working with the standard editor. If you work with the graphical editor you can work with different tools to do almost the same. (See  HelpOnGraphicalEditor ). You can test all these things best in the  WikiSandBox .          Help on Lists and Indentation</strong>       You can create different lists in a quite natural way. All you do is indent the line containing the list item with at least one space. To nest lists of different levels, you use different depths of indenting. All items on the same indent level belong to the same (sub-)list. That also means that you cannot change the style of a list after you started it.          Contents

 More Examples          
  Indentation 
   You can indent text with one or more spaces. This is especially useful if your are discussing on a wiki page and want to have some kind of thread level that is viewable        Example:</strong>                If you indent text
    like this, then it is indented in the output
      you can have multiple levels of indent     Is displayed:</strong>      If you indent text     like this, then it is indented in the output     you can have multiple levels of indent          
  Unnumbered Lists 
   For a simple unnumbered(bulleted) list use the asterisk  * " * ". You can put linebreaks in the wiki markup of a list item by indenting the additional lines at the same level as the initial star that began the list item (without preceding it with an asterisk). If you want to make a line break inside a list simply use  &lt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;  at the end of the term after which you like to see the break.            For a list without bullets start the item with a dot " . "  1           Example:</strong>                  * simple item
   this will be displayed on the same line
    * second level
   * another simple item &lt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and something that is displayed in a new line     Is displayed:</strong>      simple item   this will be displayed on the same line     second level        another simple item  
 and something that is displayed in a new line          Example:</strong>              . simple item without a bullet (no style)
    . second level     Is displayed:</strong>      simple item without a bullet (no style)     second level          
  Numbered Lists 
   To get numbered list items, start it with a number template " 1. ", " a. ", " A. ", " i. " or " I. ". To start a numbered list with a certain initial value, append " #  value " to the number template.        Examples:</strong>                1. first item
   1. second item
    1. second level     Is Displayed:</strong>      first item     second item     second level          
  Definition Lists 
   Definition lists can be created by items of this form:            &lt;whitespace&gt;term:: definition          note that the  term  cannot currently contain any wiki markup.         definition lists are also used in dictionaries (see  HelpOnDictionaries )          Example:</strong>              term:: definition
   another term:: and its definition       Is Displayed:</strong>      term  definition     another term  and its definition        
  Numbered Sections 
   Also list related but another thing is the possibilty to number the section headers. You can do this by adding a  #pragma</strong> processing instruction to the header of the page. Add           #pragma section-numbers on    to the top of the page and your section headings are getting numbers starting from 1 (subsections are also getting numbers like 1.1, 1.2 and so on)           see  HelpOnProcessingInstructions  for more
