   The SBML Level 2 Version 1 model consists of the following components:
     101 Compartments 
     300 Species 
     4 Parameters 
		 200 Rules 
		 400 Reactions 
     This model is based on the "simplistic" model of equation (1) in H Jonsson, M Heisler, Shapiro BE, Meyerowitz EM, Mjolsness E (2006) "An auxin-driven polarized transport model for phyllotaxis", PNAS, 103(5):1633-1638, Jan 31, 2006
