       Hi, my name is Josiah Carlson. This page has no other reason than for you to find out who I am, and maybe meet some people I know.  For a quick rundown of who I am, see the third paragraph  here .  So far     people have come to my site since early June of 1998.  Most of the links within these pages are self-explanatory. If you do not know where a link will lead you, fear not, the pages are (relatively) small and will load fast.
    The Latest News,     
For a full-browser version of the above, head to:  http://www.livejournal.com/users/chouyu_31    Historical Archives no longer exist :(.

Pardon me while the page gets redone to be a bit more focused on academia.  If/when I get time in the coming weeks, I'll add back in various personal stuff.

I moved all the stuff that was here to the archives.  All of the happenings that I post about in blog-type format are done on  my livejournal  which should be embedded above this post.  Go there for updates.
