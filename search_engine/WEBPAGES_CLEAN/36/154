  Ordered Collections  
      Problem: protocol specification does not support ordering of collection members
 
  Ordered collections are useful for modeling compound documents and version ordering
       Proposed solution:
 
  Add support for ordered collections to the protocol specification
  Pro:
  Makes certain document management applications "substantially easier" to build on top of WebDAV
    Con:
  Difficult for filesystem-based servers to implement ordered collections
  Handling of multiple orderings is unknown
