Global Minimum Cuts in Surface Embedded Graphs
 
 Presenter: Lowell Trott 
  Jeff Erickson,  Kyle Fo,  Amir Nayyeri  

 
The authors give a deterministic algorithm to find the minimum cut in a surface-embedded graph in near-linear time. Given an undirected graph embedded on an orientable surface of genus g, our algorithm computes the minimum cut in g^{O(g)}*nloglogn time, matching the running time of the fastest algorithm known for planar graphs, due to .a .cki and Sankowski, for any constant g.
