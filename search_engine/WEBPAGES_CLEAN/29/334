     Reconfigurability Monitoring:
 
     
 
  For more complex code (e.g., if the listï¿½s data field is moderately large, and elements are accessed in irregular fashion, the compiler cannot do such a careful allocation job as before.
  
  But it can 
  Set up monitors for accessing various data-structure fields. 
  Decide on a limit (based on analysis and profile info) after which monitor statistics are examined at RT and a switch (based on compiler-based scripts) is done in configuration patterns. 
  Set up initial configuration.
