 The Santa Claus Problem 

 Authored by: Nikhil Bansal and Maxim Sviridenko 

 Presented by Matt Nguyen 

 
Abstract:
  
The Santa Claus Problem is defined as follows:  Santa Claus has  n  presents 
that he wants to distribute among  m  kids.  Each kid has an arbitrary value 
for each present.  Let  p ij   be the value kid  i  has for present  j .  Santa's 
goal is to distribute presents in such a way that the least lucky kid is 
as happy as possible.  That is, max min  i   Sum(of among items given to kid  i )   p ij  .

The authors give an  O (log log  m  / log log log  m ) approximation for the 
restricted assignment case of the problem where  p ij   is in { p j  , 0} (That 
is, each present  j  has either value  p j   or 0 for each kid}.
