             Architecture-based Analysis &amp; Testing 
          


     Concepts 
   
      Early analysis reduces the possibility of costly corrections later. 
       Component-based software development relies fundamentally on the quality of the components of which a system is composed and their configuration .
      Functional vs. Non-functional  
    

     Techniques 
   
     Static analysis
      Internal consistency
    
      Dynamic analysis
    
      Simulation    
      Active vs. reactive analysis (critics vs. ?)        
      

     Tools 
      TRON   - Architecture Evolution Manager, a part of  ArchStudio 3.0  
       EASEL   - Architecture simulation
