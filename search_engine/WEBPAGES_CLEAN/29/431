    public class  TMWCategory 
    extends  Object 
   
Perform manipulations on Teamware objects at the Category level. 
Categories contain parent/child relationships, maintain information
including behavior, messaging, and state information for Specifications
and Instances.  This includes Message handling and execution,
Field definition including share, single or multiple element fields,
and grouping of fields into Families.
