   1.8.4 Types of CSMA/CD 
  
     n    When channel is sensed busy, stations
 wait till it       becomes
 idle and then schedule their       transmission.
 If length of busy period is long,       several stations could become active during that       period and a collision becomes inevitable
 when       the channel becomes
 idle again. This is called        persistent          CSMA/CD. ï¿½  (IEEE 802.3
 and Ethernet)    
     n     Non persistent      CSMA/CD has stations wait a       random period whenever the channel is
 sensed       busy, i.e, not grab
 it immediately it becomes       available.
 Non persistent gives better throughput       under heavy loading, persistent gives
 better       throughput under
 light loads.
