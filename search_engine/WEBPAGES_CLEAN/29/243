  Initializing Hypotheses  
    
IF	There is an influence indicated in the example
   
THEN 	Initialize the hypothesis to a single conjunct 
 
representing the features of that influence.
    
ELSE	Initialize the hypothesis to a conjunction of all features 
 
of the example.
     
Note: If more than one influence present,  select randomly
    
Example 1: (color yellow) (size large) (act dip) (age adult):   (inflate balloon)
  
Hypothesis: ((age adult))   ?   (inflate balloon)
    
Example 2: (color yellow) (size large) (act dip) (age adult):  alpha
