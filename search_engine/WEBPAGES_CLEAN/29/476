Hereditary properties of permutations are strongly testable
 
 By Tereza Klimosova and Daniel Kral 
  Presented by Michael Bannister 
 
We show that for every hereditary permutation property P and
every e0 &gt; 0, there exists an integer M such that if a permutation
pi is e0-far from P in the Kendall's tau distance, then a random 
sub-permutation of pi of order M has the property P with probability at
most e0. This settles an open problem whether hereditary permutation 
properties are strongly testable, i.e., testable with respect 
to the Kendall's tau distance. In addition, our method also yields a proof
of a conjecture of Hoppen, Kohayakawa, Moreira and Sampaio on the
relation of the rectangular distance and the Kendall's tau distance of
a permutation from a hereditary property.
