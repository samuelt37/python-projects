Windows into Relational Events: Data Structures for Contiguous
Subsequences of Edges
 
  Michael Bannister  
 
We consider the problem of analyzing social network data sets in which
the edges of the network have timestamps, and we wish to analyze the
subgraphs formed from contiguous subintervals of these timestamps. We
provide data structures for these problems that use near- linear
preprocessing time, linear space, and sublogarithmic query time to
handle queries that ask for the number of connected components, number
of components that contain cycles, number of vertices whose degree
equals or is at most some predetermined value, number of vertices that
can be reached from a starting set of vertices by time-increasing paths,
and related queries.
