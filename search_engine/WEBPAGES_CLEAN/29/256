 Abstract  
In this paper we propose a family of algorithms combining tree-clustering with conditioning
that trade space for time. Such algorithms are useful for reasoning in probabilistic and 
deterministic networks as well as for optimization tsks.  By analyzing the problem 
structure the user can select from a spectrum of hybrid algorithms, the on that best meets a 
giben time-space specification. To determine the potential of this approach, we analyze 
the structural prperties of problems coming from the circuit diagnosis domain. The analysis 
demonstrate ho the tradeoffs associated with various hybrids can beexplicated and be used 
for each problem instance.
