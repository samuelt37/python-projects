On-Line Arithmetic and Real-Time Rounding
 

 Nicholas Pippenger, Harvey Mudd College 

 
 Abstract: 
  
Arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication are usually
performed in "batch" mode, with the inputs being available in their
entirety before computation begins, and with no attempt being made to
produce any output until computation ends. This mode of operation
contrasts with "on-line" computation, in which inputs arrive
incrementally as computation proceeds, and outputs are produced
incrementally as well.  We will examine the problem of performing
arithmetic operations on-line. To do this we must first consider
various input-output conventions and discuss alternative
computational models.  The seemingly mundane problem of "rounding"
brings key issues into focus,
giving rise to new open questions as well as new results.
