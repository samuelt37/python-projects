       EcoRaft: The Game 
       We
are currently developing a downloadable version of EcoRaft for play on
home computers. Rather than being a mobile computing application
requiring multiple machines, the game will be an independent package.
Players will participate in restoration ecology, encountering the same
characters as in the installation while trying to bring a devastated
ecosystem back to life. This educational software is intended for
children ages eight through twelve and their parents and teachers and
will be available for free download. If you would like to be added to our
list of Beta testers for the game, please let us know by using the 
 Feedback form . 
 Stay tuned.
