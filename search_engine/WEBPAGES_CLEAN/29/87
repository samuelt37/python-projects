 Welcome to Dutt's Research Group  -  Group Page  -  CECS   UCI 
 

 About Danny 
 

 
    I am a final year Ph.D. Student, UCI President's Dissertation Year Fellow, Intel/GEM Fellow, Federal Cyber Service Fellow and ACM/Student Member from the University of California, Irvine looking for a full-time position. I am associated with the Center for Computer Embedded Systems, the Architectures and Compilers for Embedded Systems groups at UCI, and the Leopard/Autonomic Storage Group at IBM Almaden Research Center. My research interests are embedded system hw/sw co-design, performance modeling, memory management, compiler optimizations,  OS /HW virtualization, hardware/software security and reliability, as well as storage systems solutions. I have two major on-going projects: 1) Development of on-chip sandboxing and application driven policy generation/enforcement to guarantee trusted software execution and 2) Development of virtualized secure, reliable, low-power and scalable memory subsystems for distributed on-chip memory systems (e.g., future data-centers-on-a-chip platforms). I have a patent granted from USPTO, one filed with USPTO, and three published with IBM as well as two filed with UCI's OTA.
