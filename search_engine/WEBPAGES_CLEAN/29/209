  General energy calculator.  Defers to FreeEnergyNoResonance, but does 
  so for every resonance structure that can be enumerated for the molecule,
  then generates a score for the total hybrid. 
  Present idea:  Start with the minimum energy, and then apply a bonus 
  to that for each other resonance structure, weighted by the relative 
  Boltzmann probability of that resonance structures' energy and the number
  of atoms involved (proportional to amount of delocalization). Thus, other
  resonance structures of equal weight will confer the most bonus, while 
  structures that are much less stable (such as charge separated) will 
  confer to little to no bonus.

Initialization constructor.

temperature - Absolute temperature (Kelvin) to evaluate at.  Becomes relevant
                when using Boltzmann equation to weight different structure energies.
minimizeResonance - If true, when called on a molecule object,
                    will rearrange the electrons into a minimum energy configuration
singleEnergy - Function to provide energy score for an individual resonance structure
                contributor.  If not provided, will just default to FreeEnergyNoResonance
