  Summary  
      Semiconductor advances are bringing powerful changes to how systems are architected and built:
 
  challenges underlying assumptions on synchronous digital hardware designs
  interconnect (local and global) dominates architectural choices, local decision making is free;
  in particular, it can be made adaptable using CAD tools. 
         The AMRM Project:
 
  achieve peak performance by adapting machine capabilities to application and data characteristics.
  Initial focus on memory hierarchy promises to yield high performance gains due to worsening effects of memory (vs. cpu speeds) and increased data sets.
