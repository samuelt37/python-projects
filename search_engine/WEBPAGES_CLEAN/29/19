 Signs of a good presentation 
  speaking clearly and projecting your voice
	  eye contact with the audience
	  having something interesting to talk about
	  talk about engaging your audience (pull you in and get you interested in)
	  articulate and be clear
	  good speakers put pauses in appropriate places
	  make sure you've thought about it and it's organized and it doesn't jump all over the place
	  thinking on the fly is important even when people ask a question
	  use of visual presentations (especially tom's movie about the lawnmower)
	  Look at the audience instead of looking at your notes
	  it's good to have notes too in case you forget
	  connect with the audience by opening with an interesting statement or joke
	  throw in a compliment to the teacher
	  keep it succinct and thought about what I said before getting in front of the class
	  described the background of the system briefly
	  described what the system does
	  described the changes he wanted to make
	  skip redundant and already known information and get to specific information
	  the visual presentation managed to emphasize eye contact and showing a video takes the focus from the speaker
	  make eye contact with audience
	  have interesting material and be interested in your own material so the audience will be more interested
	  be sure of yourself and don't second guess yourself or apologize
	  be prepared beforehand and have notes so questions won't catch you off guard
	  prepare for the presentation in front of friends with a watch
	  make sure you know your time limits and what your audience knows and doesn't know
	  made decent eye contact
	  eye contact shows confidence and that you're not reading from a script
	  have an interesting opening- if you don't grab your audience at the beginning, you get lost
	  refer back to points others have made
	  keep the audience in mind so they are appropriate in terms of content and background
	  listen to other presentations carefully
	  make good eye contact
	  spoke clearly and loud enough
	  have an idea of what he was going to say
	  follow the time limit
	  emphasize the program name (title of talk)- if you miss this your audience will get lost thereafter
	  good job with the audience and described the system
	  good job with eye contact
	  structure the talk and let the audience know what points you're going to get to
	  get the material at the right level for the audience- too simple and you'll insult/bore your audience and too complex and you'll lose your audience
	  smiling will reduce the intimidation of eye contact
	  only use hand gestures if they're related to the topic of the presentation
	  most people got it within the alloted time
	  spoke loud enough for everyone to hear
	  everyone got their point across even if they were nervous
	  talked about the stuff we needed to talk about I.e. system name and changes planned
	  it helped when the presenters were interested in their topic- if they aren't bored, I'm not bored
	  it helped when people spoke slowly and clearly and were brief with their introduction and got to the point with their planned changes
	  it helped that they really knew what was wrong with the system and went on to discuss the proposed changes
	  organized with topics
	  I could understand it very well when the voice was loud and clear
	  some of them were clear and loud
	  some used humor
	  some knew exactly how to present their system and went on to cover the changes in a minute
	  some people were well prepared and knew what their system was about and what changes they wanted to make
	  if the audience had used the system before they already understood what they were talking about
	  people tried to write their names neatly on the board so I could recognize who the speaker was
	  it was good when people involved the audience and used props to get the audience to feel more involved and get them to care
	  most people were very clear and spoke loudly enough for me to hear in the back
	  most of them were interesting programs that need to be changed
	  some people were very prepared
	  the session was very interesting in that I learned about what people do
	  at the end of every session, the audience clapped which makes people feel better
	  practice the speech a lot
   Things to watch out for when giving presentations 
  talking too quickly
	  fidget
	  rambling
	  don't bore the audience
	  talking too quickly
	  was a little nervous trying to get through the material on time
	  presentation is too short and not well prepared
	  didn't cover all the points since others had covered them earlier
	  didn't use hand gestures and they help when presenting
	  don't say "um" a lot- it shows you don't know what you're talking about
	  you don't want to be overly animated but you've got to show you care about it to make your audience care about it
	  supplement your oral presentation with visual aids especially if you've got an accent
	  could not elaborate the background and comparison between his system and others
	  could not complete all of the change proposals and he had an accent
	  spoke too quickly
	  didn't make eye contact
	  wasn't aware the presentation was yesterday
	  go off topic and add unnecessary info and jargon
	  use too many clich√©s and colloquialisms
	  avoid saying "um"
	  don't talk too fast and start rambling
	  sped through the topic too quickly and felt pressure due to the time limit
	  didn't make any notes or prepare well enough for the topic
	  make sure you know the time limit on the presentation so you don't end up with too much content for the amount of time
	  spoke too much about a topic he knew too well and the audience did as well
	  didn't get to demonstrate what he had in mind
	  avoid saying "um"
	  don't be nervous
	  didn't look at the audience as much
	  paced somewhat
	  didn't have an interesting opening statement
	  spoke in monotone
	  spoke too deeply about one topic and forgot what he was going to say next
	  the company was making some of the changes he was going to propose already so he had to modify his talk
	  hard to tell time especially with the clock out of periphery
	  people rushed through it and got nervous
	  didn't make eye contact or zoned out
	  didn't elaborate enough and you were clueless about what they were talking about
	  writing the names of each speaker was too slow and made people rush, especially towards the end, so we missed the content of each speech
	  it was repetitive that there were projects that were closely related
	  I don't have eye contact with the audience
	  didn't control the time well
	  I was too nervous
	  because of the time limit, there wasn't much of a response from the audience
	  some of the presentations were interrupted by alex with the time warnings
	  some of the systems proposed I didn't understand, they lost me
	  some went way over
	  some went off topic
	  as the time ran out in class, people started talking before they got to the front of the room
	  some folks gave just a few features and went into great detail while others listed each of the features on a very high level
	  some people were rushing through the presentation
	  some people didn't go into detail about their system and thus the audience couldn't understand what they were talking about
	  it was bad when people wrote their names near another's as it created confusion
	  some people were well prepared and others were making it up off the cuff
	  people gave too much detail rather than getting to the point
	  alex's interruptions with the time warning killed the flow of some of the presentations
	  it was a one minute presentation so there wasn't much time to talk about your individual project
	  you can't tell a lot about the product in one minute- basically just the stuff you emailed to alex
