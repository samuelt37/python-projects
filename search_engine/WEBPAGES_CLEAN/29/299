We give linear-time
 quasiconvex programming 
algorithms for finding a Möbius transformation of a
 set of spheres 
in a unit ball or on the
surface of a unit sphere that maximizes the minimum size of a
transformed sphere. We can also use similar methods to maximize the
minimum distance among a set of pairs of input points. We apply these
results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
 graph drawing , viewpoint selection in
 hyperbolic  browsing, and element size
control in conformal structured
 mesh generation .
