   Tangencies : Four Tangent Circles 
 
If four circles are externally tangent in pairs forming a cycle
(i.e., AB, BC, CD, and DA are tangent), then their points of tangency also 
lie on a circle (shown in red below).  However, in contrast to the case for
 three tangent circles , the circle through 
the tangencies is not necessarily perpendicular to the other circles.

   

 

 To prove that the red circle exists,
simply use  inversion  to form a 
configuration in which A and C are the same size, at which point
the tangencies form a symmetrical trapezoid.

  This circle's existence is useful for constructing such a cycle of tangent 
circles, since it can be used to find one tangency point given the other 
three. In many other situations where one wants to find a circle tangent to 
two known circles, one can use this technique by forming a fourth circle 
with its tangencies on the line between the two known circle centers. The 
circle through the tangent points is also important in several  circle-packing 
mesh generation algorithms  as well as in a technique for  folding 
a piece of paper so that one straight cut forms your favorite polygon .

  The  bisectors  of nonadjacent pairs among the 
four tangent circles are perpendicular to the other two circles and to each 
other, as can be seen by using  inversion 
to transform one pair into either a pair of crossing lines or a pair of 
concentric circles (depending on whether or not they cross).
