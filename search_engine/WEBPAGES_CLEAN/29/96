  REFS   
 
  Editorial   
 
  There are two references to [Lagoze, 1996], yet this reference is not in the references section. There are also two references to [Fielding et al., 1996] which should be [RFC2068]. Section 24.4.3 references [RFC2141] yet this isn't in the references section.  [Changed [Lagoze, 1996] to [WC] and added a reference for it in the References section. Changed references to [Fielding et al., 1996] to [RFC2068]. Added reference to RFC 2141 in references section.]

  UUID_NOT_GUID

  None.   
   
  XML_MIME   
 
  Change   
 
  XML can be transported using text/xml and application/xml MIME types.  DAV applications must be able to accept either.  [Added new requirement to section 14: " Since XML can be transported as text/xml or application/xml, a DAV server MUST accept DAV method requests with XML parameters transported as either text/xml or application/xml, and DAV client MUST accept XML responses using either text/xml or application/xml."]

  URI_URL_DEF   
 
  Editorial   
 
  List discussion indicated some confusion about the difference between a URI and a URL.  Larry Masinter suggested a better definition for URI/URL.  [Modified the definition of URI/URL to state that the difference between a URI and a URL can be found in RFC2396].    
 
  List discussion starts with this by Geoff Clemm:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0137.html    
Larry Masinterï¿½s suggested definition language is at:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0142.html   
   
  URI_VS_RESOURCE   
 
  Change   
 
  The specification was unclear about the distinction between a URI and a resource, and whether all types of resources could have multiple URIs per resource.  [Modified the specification to explicitly say that all resources, including collections, can have more than one URI. Modified  the language in the specification such that the URI vs. resource distinction is clear. A detailed list of sections affected is listed in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0126.html     ]

  URI_URL_USE   
 
  Editorial   
 
  The use of URI and URL in the specification is imprecise.  [Reviewed use of URI and URL in the specification.]
