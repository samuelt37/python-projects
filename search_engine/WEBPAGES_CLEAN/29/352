 Replicators: B25/S4<body>


  Replicators : B25/S4 

Like the one in  B2/S13 ,
this replicator copies itself every three generations
on a one-dimensional 3-unit grid.
However, the replicator is asymmetric.

       

 When started from a single copy, adjacent replicators will always meet
head-to-head or tail-to-tail, but the replication action still works
if they are set up to meet head-to-tail.

  B25/S4 has several interesting
 known spaceships ,
including small c/2 orthogonal and c/8 diagonal ships.
