     Constraint Satisfaction

 Abstract  
A constraint satisfaction problem (csp) defined over a constraint network
consists of a finite set of variables, each associated with a domain of values,
and a set of constraints. A solution is an assignment of a value to each
variable from its domain such that all the constraints are satisfied. Typical
constraint satisfaction problems are to determine whether a solution exists,
to find one or all solutions and to find an optimal solution relative to a given
cost function. An example of a constraint satisfaction problem is the well
known k-colorability...
