   {Distracted by thinking of alternate ways of saying things that like “Moreover” and “Therefore”, in your scientific writing? Don’t be! You can now focus on the stuff that really matters and leave the burden of figuring out the new ways to say some common place words with this latex package.

  TL;DR  - LaTeX hack to produce random phrases for conjunctions like "Therefore" and "Moreover".
