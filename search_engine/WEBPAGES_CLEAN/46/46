 Abstract  
This dissertation is focused on representing and reasoning about temporal 
information. We design general temporal languages supported by specialized efficient 
inference procedures. The contribution is in combining the existing logic-based temporal
reasoning languages with the existing temporal constraint models, and in designing
new efficient inference algorithms for the combined languages. We explore a speciffic
combination of Datalog, a polynomial fragment of logic programming, with 
Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems (TCSP). To render this combination meaningful,
attention is given to the formal syntax, semantics and the inference algorithms 
employed. We address some historical challenges relevant to the introduction of time
and constraints into logic programming.
 
The dissertation surveys and develops new and improved temporal constraint
processing algorithms. When processing traditional Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSP), path-consistency (PC) algorithms are polynomial. We demonstrate that when
processing temporal constraints, PC is exponential, and thus does not scale up. To
remedy this problem, two new polynomial algorithms are introduced: Upper Lower
Tightening (ULT) and Loose Path Consistency (LPC). These algorithms are complete
for a class of problems, called the STAR class. The empirical evaluation of these
algorithms demonstrates a substantial performance improvement (up to six orders
of magnitude) relative to other algorithms. We also demonstrate the existance of a
phase transition for TCSPs.
