            UROP Research Award    
        
           
               I would like to thank the Chancellor, the ICS Department, UROP, and all the professors who have assisted me in performing research.  At the  UROP Symposium , I was awarded the "Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research" for information and computer science.  After viewing some of the outstanding posters at the UROP Symposium, I feel that many of my undergraduate colleagues who have performed outstanding research probably deserve this award more than me.  Congratulations to all.
