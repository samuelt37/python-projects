						   The Alderis project is hosted at the  Center for Embedded Computer Systems ,  University of California, Irvine , under the supervision of  Nikil Dutt . 
							 We are also collaborating with researchers from the  Distributed Systems Middleware Group  and the  DOC group  at UCI, and from  ISIS  at Vanderbilt University. 
							 The Alderis language can be analyzed using the  open-source DREAM ™ tool . 
							 DREAM ™ uses the  UPPAAL  model checker and the  Verimag IF toolset  for formal verification. 
							 The original design of the website has been created by  JayKay .
