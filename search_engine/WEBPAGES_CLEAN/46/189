   The expected extremes in a Delaunay triangulation .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and F. Yao.  18th Int. Coll. Automata, Languages and Programming, 
Madrid, Spain, 1991. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  510, 1991, 674–685.   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  1 (1): 79–92, 1991 .
 
Discusses the expected behavior of Delaunay triangulations for
points chosen uniformly at random (without edge effects).
The main result is that within a region containing  n  points,
the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor
of log  n  / log log  n.

    Polynomial-size non-obtuse triangulation of polygons .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  
 7th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  North Conway, New Hampshire, 1991, pp. 342–350 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  2: 241–255, 1992 
(special issue for 7th Symp. Comput. Geom.).
 
Any simple polygon can be triangulated with quadratically many nonobtuse
triangles.  Mostly subsumed by recent results of Bern et al described in
" Faster circle packing ".

    Tree-weighted neighbors and geometric  k  smallest spanning trees . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-77 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  4: 229–238, 1994.
 
" Finding the  k  smallest spanning trees "
used higher order Voronoi diagrams to reduce the geometric
  k  smallest 
 spanning tree  problem to the graph problem.
Here I instead use nearest neighbors for a modified
distance function where the bottleneck shortest path length
is subtracted from the true distance between points.
The result improves the planar time bounds and extends
more easily to higher dimensions.

(special issue for 8th Symp. Comput. Geom.)
 
Follows up " Polynomial size non-obtuse
triangulation of polygons ";
improves the number of triangles by relaxing the requirements on their angles.
Again mostly subsumed by results of Bern et al described in

    Faster circle packing with application to nonobtuse triangulation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 94-33 , ICS, UCI 1994.  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  7 (5): 485–491, 1997.
 
Speeds up a triangulation algorithm of Bern et al.
[" Linear-Size
Nonobtuse Triangulation of Polygons "] by finding a
collection of disjoint circles
which connect up the holes in a non-simple polygon.
The method is to use a
 minimum spanning tree  to find a collection of
overlapping circles, then shrink them one by one to reduce the number of
overlaps, using Sleator and
Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to keep track of the
connectivity of the shrunken circles.

    Approximating center points with iterated Radon points .  
K. Clarkson , D. Eppstein, 
 G.L. Miller ,
 C. Sturtivant , and 
 S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  6 (3): 357–377, 1996 .
 
Given a collection of  n  sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
 linear programming ,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both  n  and  d.

A parallelization of the quadtree constructions in
" Provably good mesh generation ",
in an integer model of computation, based on a technique of
sorting the input points using values formed by shuffling the binary
representations of the coordinates.
A side-effect is an efficient construction for the "fair split tree"
hierarchical clustering method used by Callahan and Kosaraju for various
nearest neighbor problems.

    Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   2nd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Durham, North Carolina, 1997.   6th Int. Meshing Roundtable,  Park
City, Utah, 1997, pp. 7–19 .  arXiv:cs.CG/9908016 .  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  10 (4): 347–360, 2000.
 
We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

    The skip quadtree: a simple dynamic data structure
for multidimensional data.  
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
and
 J. Z. Sun .  21st ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Pisa, 2005, pp. 296–305.  arXiv:cs.CG/0507049 .  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  18(1-2): 131–160, 2008.
 
We describe a data structure consisting of a sequence of compressed
quadtrees for successively sparser samples of an input point set, with
connections between the same squares in successive members of the
sequence.  Using this structure, we can insert or delete points and
answer approximate range queries and approximate nearest neighbor
queries in O(log n) time per operation.

We study the problem of matching geographic regions to points in a
regular grid, minimizing the distance between each region's centroid and
the corresponding grid point, and preserving as much as possible the
relative orientations between pairs of regions.
