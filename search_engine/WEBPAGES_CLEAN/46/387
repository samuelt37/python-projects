 Mixtures of Deterministic-Probabilistic Networks 

 Rina Dechter and Robert Mateescu 

 
 Abstract  
The paper introduces mixed networks, a new
framework for expressing and reasoning with
probabilistic and deterministic information. The
framework combines belief networks with constraint
networks, defining the semantics and
graphical representation. We also introduce a
new linear space search algorithm based on an
AND/OR search space. This provides the basis
for understanding the benefits of processing
the constraint information separately, resulting in
the pruning of the search space. When the constraint
part is tractable or has a small number of
solutions, using the mixed representation can be
exponentially more effective than using pure belief
networks in which constraints are modeled as
conditional probability tables. The experimental
results we provide confirm that even weak forms
of constraint propagation such as forward checking
are more effective than using the auxiliary
network.
