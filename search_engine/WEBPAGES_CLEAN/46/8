  Title</strong>: Energy-aware test-suite minimization for Android apps 
  Abstract</strong>: The rising popularity of mobile apps deployed on battery-constrained devices has motivated the need for applicable energy-aware testing techniques. However, the state-of-the-art test-suite management techniques are mainly focused on functional properties, e.g., fault detection, and do not explicitly consider the energy behavior of apps. This paper presents an energy-aware test-suite minimization approach to determine a set of tests appropriate for profiling the energy behavior of Android apps. It relies on our novel coverage criterion, eCoverage, that indicates the degree to which energy greedy parts of a program are tested. Our experiments over test suites provided for real-world apps have corroborated its ability to reduce the size of test suite by 84% (on average, 80%), while covering the same energy hotspots initially covered by the original test suite and maintaining its ability to find potential energy bugs.
