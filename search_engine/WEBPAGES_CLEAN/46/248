  Property Registry Rationale  
      DAV Properties are name, value pairs
 
  Name: a URI (can be a URL)
  Value: a sequence of well-formed XML
       Advantage: can define new properties without central registration, and without fear of namespace collisions
 
     But, sometimes you want to register properties that will be widely used.
