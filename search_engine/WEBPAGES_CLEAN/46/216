 Architectural Adaptation<body>

  Architectural Adaptation  
      Each of the following elements can benefit from increased adaptability (above and beyond CPU programming)
 
  CPU
  Memory hierarchy : eliminate false sharing
  Memory system : virtual memory layout based on cache miss data
  IO : disk layout based on access pattern
  Network interface : scheduling to reduced end-to-end latency
       Adaptability used to build
 
  programmable engines in IO, memory controllers, cache controllers, network devices
  configurable data-paths and logic in any part of the system
  configurable queueing in scheduling for interconnect, devices, memory
  smart interfaces for information flow from applications to hardware
  performance monitoring and coordinated resource management...       
Intelligent interfaces, information formats, mechanisms and policies.
