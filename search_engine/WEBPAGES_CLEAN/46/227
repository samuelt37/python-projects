  Lesson 14 - Privacy 2:  
  Informational Privacy      
 Consider 4 cases:  
   Your local supermarket offers a "No-coupon discount  card" for customers who fill out an application. On  the  application, you list your name, your sex, your income, your  employment, and the company gives you a  card. Using the  card, you then make purchases for the next year. The  supermarket then compiles the data  about your purchases,  and sells it to marketers. You have not been notified that  they intend to use the  information like this; nor have you  explicitly consented to this use. 
   Your credit card company has the same information about  you -- you supplied it when you got your credit  card.  Imagine it now collects the data about your purchases, and  then sells it to marketers. 
   Your local video store keeps data about the videos you  rent. It then sells to marketers your name and  address,  along with list of films that you have rented. 
   A credit card company enters into an agreement with the  IRS, to report to the IRS people whose spending  habits  change dramatically. The IRS then uses that data to help it  decide which returns will be subject to audit. 
   
  All four cases raise the problem of  *informational privacy*  -- the question how much control, if any, does the  law give  you over the collection, and dissemination, of information  about you that you have willingly given over  to someone  else. The answer in general is quite simple: Not much.  American law in the main gives individuals  very little  control over what others can do with the information  collected about them. 
This lack of protection distinguishes American law from most  European democracies. "Data protection" is an  important  part of European human rights law. But with slight  exceptions, it is not an important part of our tradition.  The exception is case (3): Because of the outrage over the  publication of Judge Robert Bork's video  rentals when he  was nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court, Congress  passed the Video Privacy  Protection Act of 1988, which  makes it a crime to release individualized data about the  videos any individual may rent or buy.  
  At least that part of your "record" is protected: but not  what books you check out at the library, or what your  purchases at the grocery store are, or what movies you use  your credit card to buy tickets for. These remain  unregulated by the law.  
Next time, how this lack of protection might affect the net.
