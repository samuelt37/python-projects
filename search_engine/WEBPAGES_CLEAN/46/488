 ICS 280G, Spring 1997: 
Mesh Generation for Graphics and Scientific Computation 


This graduate seminar meets Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30 - 10:50 in
EIC 126.  It will be primarily based on two surveys:
" Mesh generation and optimal
triangulation ", by Bern and Eppstein, and
" Mesh Generation ", by Bern and
Plassman.

 Students will be expected to read a paper or papers on a mesh
generation topic and present them as a lecture in the class.  The last
two or so weeks of class (depending on attendance) will be devoted to
these student lectures.  For some pointers to papers and web pages on
mesh generation, see my  mesh
generation page  from  Geometry in
Action . Some more graphics-specific pointers are located in
the  graphics
page  of the same site.
