      Ubiquitous Displays      
   
    
    Imagine a world in which people can use their
  handheld mobile devices to project and transfer content. Everyone can join
  the collaboration by simply bringing their mobile devices close to each
  other. People can grab data from each others' devices with simple hand
  gestures. Now imagine a large display created by tiling multiple displays
  where multiple users can interact with a large dynamically changing data set
  in a collocated, collaborative setting and the displays will take care of the
  data transfer and handling functions in a way that is transparent to the
  users.     
    We are working on several
  challenges in building ubiquitous displays including but not limited to:    
     1.      
      Geometric Registration    
     2.      
      Color Seamlessness    
     3.      
      Distributed Interaction    
         
                     
         
    Geometric Registration on a Cylindrical Screen
  with 8 Projectors and a Vertically Extruded Screen with 6 Projectors    
         
                
         
    Color Registration on a Cylindrical Screen with 8
  Projectors and a Rear Projection Screen with 9 Projectors
