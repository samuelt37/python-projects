 Process Isolation: Motivation<body>

  Process Isolation: Motivation  
      Multiprocess protection is a fundamental modularity element in software systems
 
  Non-modular systems are not robust: MacOS, Win95, Win98, etc.  
  Software faults are not contained
  Systems cannot be safely extended (restraining progress)
       Adaptive systems take this one level further
 
  Software-software interactions
  Software-adapted hardware interactions (sharing)
  Adapted hardware - adapted hardware interactions (sharing)
  =&gt; how can we support flexibly extensible adaptable systems?
