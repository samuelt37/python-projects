Experiments We compared performance of linear classifiers trained with the Boost-SMO and the Full-SMO (conventional SMO algorithm) on the following three data sets: the Reuters Data, the  Microsoft   Web  Data and the UCI Adult Data. For the Reuters Data we looked at the classes "acq" and "earn" that have the greatest number of positive examples. The Microsoft       Dmitry Pavlov and Darya Chudova and Padhraic Smyth.
