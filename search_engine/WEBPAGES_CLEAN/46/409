 Abstract  
This paper focuses on network default theories. Etherington [Etherington, 1987] has established 
a correspondence between inheritance networks with expections and a subset of Reiter's default 
logic called network default theories, thus providing a formal semantics and a notion of correct 
inference for such networks. We show that any such propositional network default theory can be 
compiled in polynomial time into a classical propositona theory such that the set of models of 
the latter coincides with the set of extensions of the former. We then show how constraint 
satisfaction teachniques can be used to compute extensions an to identify tractable network 
default theories. For any porpositional network theory, our algorithms compute all its extensions 
and verifies if a given conclusion is in one or all extensions.
