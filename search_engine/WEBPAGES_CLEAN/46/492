class OEVectorBindings
    
The  OEVectorBindings  class is used to store a set of vector
bindings or lexigraphic replacements that may appear in a SMARTS
pattern.  A vector binding is a SMARTS pattern bound to a name.  For
example, the name ''   $HALO   '' can be used to represent the
pattern ''   $(F,Cl,Br,I)    in order to make a pattern more human
readable.  The OEVectorBindings class converts SMARTS patterns written
using vector bindings (human readable form) to the corresponding
machine readable form by performing a name to pattern replacement.
