 Simultaneous Source Location on Trees 

 Presented by Josiah Carlson 

 
Abstract:
  
We describe the Simultaneous Source Location problem on Trees.
We provide an algorithm which solves the problem in
 O ( n  2 ) time and space,
which improves upon a previous  O ( n  3 ) time
and  O ( n  2 ) space algorithm.
We also provide an algorithm that solves a variant of this problem in
 O ( n ) time and  O ( depth (G)* degree (G)) space.
