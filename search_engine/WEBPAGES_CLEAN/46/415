       Project Overview 
        Responding to natural or man-made 
      disasters in a timely and effective manner can reduce deaths and injuries, 
      contain or prevent secondary disasters, and reduce the resulting economic 
      losses and social disruption. . The drillsim simulator as a part of the 
      CAMAS testbed is  multi-agent crisis simulator that can play out the 
      activities of the response (e.g., evacuation) during crisis from the 
      perspective of IT solution integration.  The simulator will model 
      different response activities at both the macro and micro level, and model 
      the information flow between different entities. IT solutions, models etc 
      can be plugged in at different interfaces between these activities or at 
      some point of the information flow in order to study the effectiveness of 
      research solutions in disaster management and tested for utility in 
      disaster response. In addition the simulator will also have capabilities 
      to integrate real life drills into the simulated response activity using 
      an instrumented environment with sensing 
  capabilities.
