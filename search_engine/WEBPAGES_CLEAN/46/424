Abstract: 
We introduce a new data structuring paradigm in which operations can
be performed on a data structure not only in the present, but also in
the past. In this new paradigm, called retroactive data structures,
the historical sequence of operations performed on the data structure
is not fixed. The data structure allows arbitrary insertion and
deletion of operations at arbitrary times, subject only to
consistency
requirements. We initiate the study of retroactive data structures by
formally defining the model and its variants. We prove that, unlike
persistence, efficient retroactivity is not always achievable. Thus,
we present efficient retroactive data structures for queues, doubly
ended queues, priority queues, union-find, and decomposable search
structures.
