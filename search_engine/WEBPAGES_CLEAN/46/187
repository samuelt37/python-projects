8.23 OERxnRole 
 

 
The OERxnRole namespace is used to define symbolic constants for the
``Role'' property of OEAtomBases.  This stored property is used to
record that ``role'' played by the atom in a reaction molecule.  The
default value is OERxnRole::None.  The other currently defined values
are OERxnRole::Reactant, OERxnRole::Agent, OERxnRole::Catalyst and
OERxnRole::Product.

  
    
namespace OERxnRole
{
  const unsigned int None               =  0;
  const unsigned int Reactant           =  1;
  const unsigned int Agent              =  2;
  const unsigned int Catalyst           =  2;
  const unsigned int Product            =  3;
}
