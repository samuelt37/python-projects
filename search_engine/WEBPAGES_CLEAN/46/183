   Other software qualities  
 
In this dissertation, we focused on implementability
and later validity as interesting software qualities
for which causal relationships can be established
and belief values can be determined.  We believe,
however, that uncertainty should also be modeled
for additional software qualities, including,
among others, correctness, reliability, efficiency,
safety, and maintainability.  Of particular
relevance is the work carried out at CSR, discussed
in chapterÂ    , where uncertainty is
modeled for software testability and dependability
assessment tasks.
As mentioned earlier, qualities associated with entities must
be consistent with causal relationships such that the resulting
network is meaningful.
