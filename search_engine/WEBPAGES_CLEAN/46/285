 Hybrid Processing of Beliefs and Constraints 

 Rina Dechter, David Larkin 

 
 Abstract  
This paper explores algorithms for processing probabilistic and deterministic 
information when the former is represented as a belief network and the latter 
as a set of boolean clauses. The motivating tasks are 1. evaluating belief 
networks having a large number of deterministic relationships and 2. 
evaluating probabilities of complex boolean queries or complex evidence information 
over a belief network. We present and analyze a variable elimination algorithm that 
exploits both types of information, and provide empirical evaluation demonstrating 
its computational benefits.
