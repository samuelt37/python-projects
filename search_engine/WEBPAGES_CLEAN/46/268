   Theory North printer setup  
 

 

Address: sloth.ics.uci.edu 
Protocol: HP JetDirect
Model: Brother HL-6050DN 
 

 
For most setups, the above just works. On CrunchBang Waldorf (testing) I had some issues. 
I had to download and install the driver's from Brother, then fix the settings.
Follow the instructions from Brother:
 

 
 http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn1a.html 

 
    Create a Symbolic Link needed by the brother packages. 
    sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/cupsys /etc/init.d/lpd 
 
  
   Download LPR and CupsWrapper drivers 
     http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#HL-6050D  
 
  
   Install the LPR and then the Cupswrapper driver 
    dpkg  -i  –force-all  (lpr-drivername) 
 
   dpkg  -i  –force-all  (cupswrapper-drivername)  
 
     might have to mkdir if the installer can't find the directories it needs. 
 
  
   Check if the LPR driver and cupswrapper driver are installed  
    dpkg  -l  |  grep  Brother 
 
  
   Then I modified printer settings, in crunchbang's right-click menu. 
    If that doesn't work, try to modify using the cups web interface 
     http://localhost:631/printers  
 
  
   To login to the cups web interface, you to be added to the right user group: 
    sudo adduser (username) lpadmin
