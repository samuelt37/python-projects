     Research Faculty      »</strong>  Magda  El Zarki     »</strong>  Ramesh  Jain     »</strong>  Sharad  Mehrotra     »</strong>  Nalini  Venkatasubramanian     Multimedia computing started receiving attention more than a decade ago.
  Naturally, early systems dealt with very limited aspect
             of multimedia.  With progress in technology, several 
computing addresses important issues in creation, communication, 
storage, access,
             and presentation of information and experiences.  In our 
department, we are addressing research issues in fundamentals of 
multimedia
             systems and their advanced applications.
