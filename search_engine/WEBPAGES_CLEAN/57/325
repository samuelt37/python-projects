 Cake Cutting Really is Not a Piece of Cake

Abstract:
  
We consider the well-known cake cutting problem in which a protocol wants
to divide a cake among  n ≥2 players in such a way that each player
believes that they got a fair share.  The standard Robertson-Webb model
allows the protocol to make two types of queries, Evaluation and Cut, to
the players.  A deterministic divide-and-conquer protocol with complexity
 O ( n  log  n ) is known.  We provide the first Ω( n  log  n ) lower bound on
the complexity of any deterministic protocol in the standard model.
