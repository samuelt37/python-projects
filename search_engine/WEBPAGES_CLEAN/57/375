 Guards Placement for Wireless Localization 

 Presented by Nodari Sitchinava 

 
Abstract:
  
This is continuation of the topic presented last winter.
New results that were achieved over the summer will be presented.
In particular, the tight bound for orthogonal polygons
and an improved proof for the upper bound for arbitrary polygons.
  
This is joint work with Michael Goodrich and David Eppstein.
