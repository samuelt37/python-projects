     Research Faculty      »</strong>  David  Eppstein     »</strong>  Michael T. Goodrich     »</strong>  Aditi  Majumder     »</strong>  Gopi  Meenakshisundaram     »</strong>  Bill  Tomlinson     »</strong>  Shuang  Zhao     Focuses on the field of visual computing that deals with 
generating/capturing, representing, rendering and interacting with 
synthetic
      and real-world images and video. We work on end-to-end solutions 
from capturing of images and geometry; representing large geometric,
      image, and video data sets; geometry and image processing; 
interactive access and rendering of large visual data sets; algorithms 
for
      building large area immersive displays for the presentation of 
visual content; and interaction techniques in both small personal 
displays
      and in large displays for collaborative environments.  

    Current and future research areas include, but are not limited to:

         Designing new cameras with advanced capabilities for 
capturing real-world scenes.
           Image processing for enhanced visual content quality
           Computational geometry and graph algorithms for 
geometry processing
           Interactive rendering of very large geometric data 
sets.
           Ubiquitous displays -- Reconfigurable multi-projector 
display systems.
           Interaction techniques for large area displays.
           Sketch based modeling and interaction for personal 
displays.
         Applications are Internet-based visualization of remotely located 
complex objects, volume manipulation and visualization, geographic
      information systems, and simplified 3-D rendering based on 2-D 
images.  More information:  http://graphics.ics.uci.edu/
