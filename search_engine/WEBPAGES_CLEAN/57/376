      WebDAV Requirements Document Version History 

       The WebDAV requirements document describes, at a high level,
	the functionality required to perform distributed authoring
	and versioning on the World Wide Web.  This document
	constrains the WebDAV protocol specification, and is derived
	in part by the scenarios contained in the WebDAV scenarios
	document.  The document is a deliverable item of the IETF
	WEBDAV Working Group.

	  This document initially began as two separate requirements
	documents, one for distributed authoring requirements, and one
	for distributed versioning requirements, which were developed
	in July-August, 1996.  Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine, was
	the initial editor of the distributed authoring requirements.
	David Fiander, MKS, took an initial cut at a versioning
	requirements document, and this task was later carried forward
	by David Durand, Boston University, and Fabio Vitali,
	Univ. of Bolonga, who became co-editors of the distributed
	versioning requirements.

	  In late January, 1997, Judith Slein, Xerox, became editor of a
	combined distributed authoring and versioning requirements
	document ( announced February 3, 1997 ), and, working with Fabio Vitali, merged and tightened
	the two documents.
