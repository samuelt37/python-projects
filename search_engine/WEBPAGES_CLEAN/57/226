unsigned int GetMaxMatches() const
    
This method returns the maximum number of subgraph isomorphism
solutions that the instance of OESubSearch will identify before
terminating the search.  A value of zero indicates that no arbitrary
limit has been set on the total number of subgraph isomorphism
solutions to be identified.  By default, instances of OESubSearch set
the maximum number of matches to 1024.
