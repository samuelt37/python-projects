                    Quick Biography 
                   Prof. Michael Franz was an early pioneer in the areas
                    of mobile code and dynamic compilation. He created an early just-in-time compilation system, contributed to the theory and practice of continuous compilation and optimization, and co-invented the trace compilation technology that eventually became the JavaScript engine in Mozilla's Firefox browser. 
                   His current
                    research emphasis lies in the area of  Software Systems</strong>, particularly focusing on compiler, virtual machine, and related system-level techniques for making software either  safer</strong>, or  faster</strong>, or  both</strong>. Some of this research also falls under the labels  Computer Security</strong>,  Trustworthy Computing</strong>, and  Software Engineering</strong>. 
                   Dr. Franz has graduated 25 Ph.D. students as their primary advisor and has published more than 130 peer-reviewed research papers. He is the
                      Principal Investigator on many competitive grants from
                      the federal government, totaling  over $16M (of which more than $11M as sole PI), and has received more than a million dollars in unrestricted gifts from industry in appreciation of the research innovations he has contributed. 
                     Franz received a Dr.
                      sc. techn. degree in Computer Science (advisor:  Niklaus
                        Wirth ) and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH degree, both
                      from the  Swiss Federal Institute
                        of Technology, ETH Zurich . He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM )
                      and a Fellow of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ). His  academic genealogy  includes Carl Friedrich Gauss and three Turing Award Winners (one of whom additionally also is a Nobel Laureate).

                       The Economist publishes an article about my research (May 2014) 
                       The article " Divided We Stand " in the 24th May 2014 print edition of The Economist contained an excellent and extremely accessible summary of my recent work on  automated software diversity. Kudos to the writer Peter Haynes for explaining things to a general audience in a manner that is so easy to understand.  
                      Several Hundred Million People Using Our Research Results Daily 
                       I have been one of the pioneers of dynamic compilation research. My first paper  on JIT compilation was published in 1991 and my dissertation, entitled "Code Generation On-The-Fly: A Key To Portable Software," appeared two full years before the announcement of Java. Over the past twenty years, my students and I have worked on different aspects of dynamic compilation, most recently focusing on the development of  Trace Compilation  on which  Andreas Gal  and I  recently received a U.S. patent . 
                       This work has had substantial impact. The trace compilation technology behind the " TraceMonkey " JavaScript compiler that is built into Mozilla's Firefox browser (since June 2009 / Firefox 3.5) originated in our lab. It is used daily by several hundred million people. More recently, the "Compartmental Memory Management" technique invented by my student Gregor Wagner has also made it into the mainline Firefox distribution (since March 2011 / Firefox 4.0).  
                      Post-Doctoral Researcher Search 
                       I anticipate that one or more full-time Post-doctoral Scholar positions will become available soon and I am looking for capable candidates to join my team. Appointments will be initially for a one year period and will be renewable. These positions require a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and demonstrated expertise, at the highest level, in the areas of compiler construction and/or computer security  . 
                       Current graduate students who fulfill all other requirements but who have not quite yet completed their Ph.Ds. are welcome to apply; however, any offer will be made contingent on successful completion of the degree. 
                       Salary to be between $60,000-$80,000 annually, depending on experience and qualification. Candidates without experience in the area of compilers are not encouraged to apply. 
                       Interested applicants should apply via the web site at  https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/apply/JPF03300 . Please  be aware that it may take up to 6 months to obtain the necessary work permit for non-U.S. citizens. 
                       The University of California, Irvine is an equal opportunity employer committed to excellence through diversity.
