              Abstract   

The paper focuses on finding thembest solutions of
a combinatorial optimization problem defined over
a graphical model (e.g., themmost probable expla-
nations for a Bayesian network). We describe elim-
m-opt, a new bucket elimination algorithm for solv-
ing the m-best task, provide efficient implementa-
tion of its defining combination and marginaliza-
tion operators, analyze its worst-case performance,
and compare it with that of recent related algo-
rithms. An extension to the mini-bucket frame-
work, yielding a collection of bounds for each of
the m-best solutions is discussed and empirically
evaluated. We also formulate the m-best task as a
regular reasoning task over general graphical mod-
els defined axiomatically, which makes all other in-
ference algorithms applicable.
