  Current Approaches	  
      Base notation on formalism designed to handle evolving systems
 
  e.g., Pi Calculus
  expressive, but generality may limit ability to predict outcome and to perform static analyses
       Just model the structural aspects of reconfiguration
 
  e.g., Darwin, LeMetayer graph grammars
  understandable, but limits ability to reason about interaction between behavior and reconfiguration
