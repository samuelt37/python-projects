"The Priority R-Tree: A Practically Efficient
and Worst-Case-Optimal R-Tree" by Lars Arge, et al.
 
Presented by Ivan A. Seredkin
 
 
Abstract: This paper presents the Priority R-tree, or PR-tree, which is the
first R-tree variant that always answers a window query using
O((N/B) 1-1/d +T/B) I/Os, where N is the number of d-dimensional
(hyper-) rectangles stored in the R-tree, B is the disk block size, and T
is the output size. This is provably asymptotically optimal and
significantly better than other R-tree variants, where a query may visit
all N/B leaves in the tree even when T=0.
