Title: A Survey of Variable-Length Integer Coding Techniques
 
Speaker: Kevin Wortman 

 
Abstract:
The need often arises to encode a sequence of arbitrary integers.  It
is possible to map such a sequence to a stream of bytes and present
the result to a general purpose compression algorithm, such as gzip,
but the results are disappointing.
  
However, if we introduce the assumption that an integer's frequency is
approximately inversely proportional to its magnitude, it becomes
possible to encode integers efficiently.  This talk will introduce one
motivation for integer coding: the lossless compression of digitized
audio.  Then it will proceed to paraphrase a 1996 paper by Peter
Fenwick that summarizes several methods of integer coding, and
presents an experimental comparison of their effectiveness.
