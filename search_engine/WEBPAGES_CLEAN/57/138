3.25.6 open 
 

 
    
bool open()
bool open(const char *fname)
bool open(const std::string fname)
    
Open a file for reading with an input oemolstream.  The fname argument
specifies the filename of the file to be opened.  The open with no
arguments may be used to specify that the input oemolstream should read from
standard in (std::cin).  In this case the format defaults to SMILES.  If an
argument is used, open sets the file format property of the input
oemolstream, based upon the extension of the given filename.  If the file
extension isn't recognized, a warning is issued and the file format is set
to OEFormat::UNDEFINED.  If the filename is appended with ``.gz'', the
oemolstream will gunzip it on the fly.  The filename-based file format may be
overridden by calling oemolistream::SetFormat explicitly with the desired
file format.  If only a file extension is used as the filename (``.oeb.gz''),
then std::cin is opened with the format specified by the given extensions.
