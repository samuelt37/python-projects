Drawing Planar Graphs on a Curve

This paper introduces and studies the concept of a curve
embedding of a planar graph. Let  C  be the family of 2D curves described
by concave functions and let  G  be a planar graph. A curve embedding
of  G  is a linear ordering of the vertices of  G  such that there exists a
crossing-free 2D drawing of  G  where the vertices are constrained to be
on any given curve of  C  and the edges are drawn as polylines with at
most one bend. We prove that every planar graph has a curve embedding
which can be computed in linear time. Further we present applications
of the concept of curve embedding to upward drawings and point-set
constrained drawings.
