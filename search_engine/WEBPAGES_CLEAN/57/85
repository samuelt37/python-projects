&gt; Peeking into the syntax of a URL is an abstraction violation.
&gt; Telling folks "watch out! Don't spell your URLs this way, cuz
&gt; that syntax is reserved for version info" is a no-no.

Well, there's already precedent for form URLs, for example, e.g.,

   http://host.dom/form-handler?x=a+y=b+z=c 

even though the client treats any URL it receieves as 'opaque', they
can still be constructed. I see some value in just continuing this
tradition for versions.

In fact, how about making a "version" just a special kind of
query?
