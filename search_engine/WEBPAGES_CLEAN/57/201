 SEPIA 
 Overview 
 
The module contains the implementation of the technique presented in [1] and [2].
 
 Usage 
 
For compiling instructions, please see CompileDoc.
 
 
An example of how to use the module is available in  src/sepia/example.cc .
 
 Interface 
 
The main class of the module is Sepia which is declared in  src/sepia/sepia.h .
 
 
The main methods of Sepia are:
 
   Sepia(const vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;dataset, 
        unsigned thresholdMin,
        unsigned thresholdMax);
  Sepia(const vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;dataset,
        const string &amp;filename);

  void build();
  void saveData(const string &amp;filename) const;
  
  float getEstimateSelectivity(const string &amp;query, unsigned editdist) const;
  
The main idea is that the user can create a Sepia object by specifying a vector of strings (dataset) and a few extra parameters (for details see [1]) or load an existing one from a file. If the object was not loaded, then it needs to be built. Next, the user has the option of saving the object to a file. In order to estimate the selectivity of a given string, the user calls  select . 
 
 Performance 
 
The performance results are available in [1] and [2].
