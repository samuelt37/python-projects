 ICS 21 / CSE 21 Summer 2012 
   Schedule 

 

 

  This schedule is a work in progress and will be updated throughout the quarter; check in before each lecture for updates.  In general, I'll try to keep the schedule at least a week or so ahead, so that you can anticipate where we're headed. 

 All assigned readings are from the Horstmann text.  It is a good idea to skim the assigned reading  before  the lecture for the main ideas, attend lecture, and then to go through the assigned reading again to fill in the details that you missed, both in your initial skim of the reading and in the lecture. 

 Not all lectures have reading corresponding to them.  This is generally 
because a block of reading corresponds to more than one lecture.  Occasionally, 
the material covered may not be in the textbook.
