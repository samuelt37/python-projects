     Filtering Search: A New Approach to Query-Answering 
 
  By Bernard Chazelle  
  Presented by Darren Strash, UCI 

 
I will present a classic technique for solving retrieval problems 
(problems where we want to report objects that satisfy a query), 
and apply this technique to well-known problems such as Orthogonal 
Range Searching and Segment Intersection.
