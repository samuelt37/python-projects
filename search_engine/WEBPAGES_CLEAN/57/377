  Chiron Patch Information 
 

To date, there have been five patch releases to the original release
of Chiron 1.4.  The patches must be applied in order.  You can tell which
patch level your installation of Chiron is by looking at the 
$CHIRON_ROOT/src/types/patchlevel.h file.  Where $CHIRON_ROOT is the location
of your Chiron installation.  This file contains a 
#define PATCHLEVEL symbol telling you which patch level your release
is at.  For example, if you are at patch level 5, you should obtain and install
patches 6 and 7.

    Patch 1 
   Patch 2 
   Patch 3 
   Patch 4 
   Patch 5 
   Patch 6 
   Patch 7
