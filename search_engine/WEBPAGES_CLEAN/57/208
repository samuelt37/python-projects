Over the decades, the increasing use of software has enabled construction 
and deployment of ever more capable computer-based systems. However, managing,
 controlling, developing, and assessing the development of software-intensive 
systems are complex 
and error-prone tasks that are made even more difficult by the lack of meaning
ful data on key products and processes. Such data 
should provide visibility into the health and status of the evolving software 
system, assist in early identification of current and
potential problem areas, and aid in predicting such software system 
characteristics as reliability, maintainability, cost, and schedule. 
Additionally, such data are essential to process improvement activities, 
since they provide a means for quantifying process 
characteristics and assessing changes - both improvements and degradations - 
in these characteristics.

  

To enable software system metrics to provide real data for the purposes 
mentioned above, comprehensive data collection and analysis methods which 
treat software as an integral part of a larger system are needed. This 
presentation introduces a software system metrics approach that has been 
developed for this purpose. The presentation discusses the utility of the 
approach, introduces a set of 
recommended metrics that covers both the system and the software throughout 
the life cycle, and provides some examples of these 
in the area of metrics for requirements. Next, key concepts and planning 
guidelines for metrics programs are highlighted and the 
relationship of metrics to process improvement is addressed. The presentation 
concludes by identifying some current topics in metrics and some sources of 
additional information.

  

 Biography: </strong>
Rita Costello Creel is an Engineering Specialist in the Software Engineering 
Subdivision at the Aerospace Corporation, where she supports acquisition and 
analysis activities for large, software-intensive systems. Prior to joining 
Aerospace, she worked 
in the Space and Technology Group at TRW, Inc., where she participated in 
and led full life-cycle software system development 
activities for communication and scientific satellite systems. She has a 
Bachelor's degree in Engineering and Computer Science and 
a Master's degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from 
California State University, Long Beach.

  

 Biography:</strong> 
Sharon K. Hoting is the Director of the Software Acquisition and Analysis 
Department at the Aerospace Corporation. 
She has over 25 years of demonstrated success in software engineering 
organizations in the development/management/GSE&amp;I of 
government software-intensive systems, both as a development contractor 
and as a government advisor. She is knowledgeable in 
software process, software products and their assessment, and the 
relationship of software to the systems engineering process and 
products. As a contractor, she was responsible for the development of 
proposals, functional management of software engineering 
personnel, project management of a variety of software development efforts, 
and technical development of many software systems 
and tools. She has a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a Master's degree 
in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles.
