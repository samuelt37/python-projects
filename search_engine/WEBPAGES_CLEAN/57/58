  Policies: Implementation  
        Trusting someone to drive a car:
 

      By identity: a list of authorized drivers
  By object: a set of keys to be handed out
  By capability: rent a car with license &amp; insurance
         Choice of �primary axis� depends on:
 

      Simplicity: which is the smallest set?	bank employees
  Dynamism: avoid enumerating the volatile. 	drivers
  Efficiency: what�s easiest to check?	Licenses
         Watch for conflicting policy styles
