         Mark featured on KPCC's AirTalk about multitasking in the workplace</strong>
          
                    
Informatics Professor  Gloria Mark</strong> was the featured expert on a May 2 segment of KPCC’s show   AirTalk   discussing her research into multitasking in the workplace.
 
  
The story titled “Is monotasking the new multitasking?” relies on Mark's expertise to help answer the questions:

   Multitasking in the workplace is typically lauded as an ideal capability for workers. But, how much work do multitaskers get done?
     Is there a lack of focus, making people more susceptible to making errors? Is there value in concentrating on one task at a time?  
     How comfortable are you making the choice to zero in on one project at a time? How much time can you let pass before you check your email or twitter feed? Can you ignore a text? 
   
Listen to the entire Mark's interview on the  AirTalk story .
