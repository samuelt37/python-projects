        Studies in Lower Bounding Probability of Evidence using the Markov Inequality    
       Vibhav Gogate, Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter.     
              Abstract   
				Computing the probability of evidence even with
				known error bounds is NP-hard. In this paper we
				address this hard problem by settling on an easier
				problem. We propose an approximation which
				provides high confidence lower bounds on probability
				of evidence but does not have any guarantees
				in terms of relative or absolute error. Our
				proposed approximation is a randomized importance
				sampling scheme that uses the Markov inequality.
				However, a straight-forward application
				of the Markov inequality may lead to poor lower
				bounds. We therefore propose several heuristic
				measures to improve its performance in practice.
				Empirical evaluation of our scheme with stateof-
				the-art lower bounding schemes reveals the promise of our approach.
