Coordination of Groups of Mobile Autonomous Agents Using Nearest Neighbor Rules
 
 
Gio Borje
 

 
In a recent Physical Review Letters article, Vicsek et al. propose a
simple but compelling discrete-time model of  n  autonomous agents
(i.e., points or particles) all moving in the plane with the same
speed but with different headings. Each agent's heading is updated
using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the
headings of its "neighbors". In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide
simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule
they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same
direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite
the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time
as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation
for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are
derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model
proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is
stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov
function.
