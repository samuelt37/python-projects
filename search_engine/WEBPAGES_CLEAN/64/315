    On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms . 
D. Eppstein.  
 SIGACT News  18 (3): 38–40, 1987 .
 
A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
 alphametic )
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

    Ten algorithms for Egyptian fractions . 
D. Eppstein.  Mathematica in Education and Research  4 (2): 5–15, 1995.
 
Number theory.
I survey and implement in  Mathematica  several methods
for representing rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions.
One of the methods involves searching for paths in a certain graph
using a   k  shortest paths  heuristic.

    Zonohedra and Zonotopes . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-53 , ICS, UCI, 1995.  Mathematica in Education and Research  5 (4): 15–21, 1996.
 
I use Mathematica to construct  zonotopes 
and display zonohedra.
Many examples are shown, including one used for a lower bound
in " The
centroid of points with approximate weights ".
This paper is also available in
 HTML  and 
  Mathematica  notebook  formats.

We apply techniques from " Quadrilateral meshing
by circle packing " to a magic trick of Houdini:
fold a piece of paper so that with one straight cut, you can form your
favorite polygon.

Worksh. Computational Geometry , Johns Hopkins Univ., 1999.  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  (special
issue for 4th CGC Worksh.) 24 (2): 51–62, 2003 .
 
We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

(special issue for 11th CCCG).
 
We show that, for any n, there exists a mechanism formed by connecting
polygons with hinges that can be folded into all possible n-ominos.
Similar results hold as well for n-iamonds, n-hexes, and n-abolos.

    Tangent spheres and triangle centers . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/9909152 .   Amer. Math. Monthly  108 (1): 63–66, 2001 .
 
Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .

    Searching for spaceships . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.AI/0004003 . 
MSRI Combinatorial Game Theory Research Worksh., July 2000.  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 433–453 .
 
We describe software that searches for
 spaceships in Conway's Game of
Life and related two-dimensional cellular automata .
Our program searches through a state space
related to the de Bruijn graph of the automaton,
using a method that combines features of breadth first and
iterative deepening search, and includes fast
bit-parallel  graph reachability 
and  path enumeration  algorithms
for finding the successors of each state.
Successful results include a
 new 2c/7
spaceship in Life , found by searching a space with 2^126 states.

    One-dimensional peg solitaire, and duotaire .  C. Moore

 math.CO/0008172 .

 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 341–350 .
 
We describe by a regular expression the one-dimensional peg-solitaire
positions reducible to a single peg, and provide a linear-time algorithm
(based on finding  shortest paths  in an
associated DAG) for
reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg
solitaire moves in an attempt to be the one to move last.

    Phutball endgames are hard .  E. Demaine ,
 M. Demaine ,
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CC/0008025 .  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 351–360 .
 
We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's
Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the
current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In
contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

    Hinged kite mirror dissection . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0106032 .
 
We show that any polygon can be cut into kites, connected into a chain
by hinges at their vertices, and that this hinged assemblage can be
unfolded and refolded to form the mirror image of the polygon.

    Triangles and squares . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at EuroConf. Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Applications,
Bellaterra, Spain, 2001, p. 114.
 
Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

    Nonrepetitive paths and cycles in graphs with application to Sudoku . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0507053 .
 
We describe algorithms and hardness results for finding paths in
edge-labeled graphs such that no two consecutive edges have the same label,
and use our algorithms to implement heuristics for a program that
automatically solves and generates Sudoku puzzles.

    Growth and decay in life-like cellular automata . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0911.2890 .   Game of Life Cellular Automata  (Andrew Adamatzky, ed.),
Springer, 2010, pp. 71–98 .
 
We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns
can die out completely, with the aim of finding rules with interesting
behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life. We survey a number of such rules.
  
    Solving single-digit Sudoku subproblems . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1202.5074 .  6th International Conference on Fun with Algorithms (FUN 2012) ,
Venice, Italy, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7288, 2012, pp. 142–153 .
 
We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

    Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0066 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 436–447 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.
