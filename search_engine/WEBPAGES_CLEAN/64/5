class OEBaseData
    
OEBaseData is an abstract class which defines the interface necessary
for storage, retrieval, and duplication of data stored through the
generic data interface in the OEBase (Section  9.1 ) class.
Data stored in classes derived from OEBaseData is identified through
data tags.  The ability to perform run-time type checking is also
built into the class.
