 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Source Transformations  Intent       Source transformations, like  binary transformations ,    rewrite portions of an application to introduce new    functionality. The difference is that source transformations    operate on the source code whereas binary transformations    operate at the object or machine code.   Also Known As       Source patch files.   Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Source transformations have the following benefits:       They are composable.          They act as application-level behavior mix-ins.          They simplify analysis.       Source transformations have the following limitations:       They require access to source code.          They confound debugging.        Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses        Jack C.    Wileden 's PolySpin and JavaSpin are examples of the    source transformation mechanism. Refine is a second example.   Related Mechanisms       ?      Backto the Adaptation home page   .
