Sorry for the long excerpt:  I believe what you are describing is what
in SCM circles is called "change sets."  That's the approach to version
management where a configuration object is stored as a collection of
deltas and the contents of a "version" is the result of combining any
arbitrary subset of those deltas.  This is in contrast to more traditional
SCM where a configuration object is a tree of versions, and deltas lead
from one version to the next.

This model is embodied in the commercial SCM system Aide-de-Camp.
