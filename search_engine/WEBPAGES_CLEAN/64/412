24.3 oeostream 
 

 
All of the  oestream  classes that provide output handling derive from
this class. This class provides efficient implementations of standard output
stream including:  putbyte, write, flush . Like the standard
 ostreams , the     operator is overloaded for easy output of data to
text streams.

  
This class also provides the framework but not fully functional implementations
of the  open  and  close  routines. However, if a data buffer already
exists in memory, an  oeostream  instance can be used to write directly to
that buffer using the provided  open  and  close  routines.

  
    char      buffer[13];
oeostream os;

if (os.open(buffer, 13))
{
    os &lt;&lt; "hello world!";
    os.flush();
    os.close();
}
