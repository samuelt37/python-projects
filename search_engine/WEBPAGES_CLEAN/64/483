			    The Center for Cyber-Security and Privacy focuses on the importance of security and privacy in our increasingly computerized life. This importance of security and privacy is evident in the prevalence of major news stories about identity theft, privacy-eroding legislation and industry practices, spam, phishing, worms and viruses. The Center aims to develop feasible and effective remedies that are legally permissible and enforceable, and understandable and acceptable for computer users.
