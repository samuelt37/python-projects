    Behavior of an object is determined by a set of operations defined for the object  Operations typically access or modify attribute values belonging to an object  All instances of a class can use the operations defined for that class  (At any time, there exist zero, one or more instances of a class)    Operation names should be unique within a class  Class operations depend on your viewpoint  Example: operations for Car
