  LaTeX make file  
 
 name  =  paper
options  =   -- file - line -  error 
 ifeq   "$(shell uname)"   "Darwin" 
        options  +=   -- shell - escape  -- synctex = 1
 endif 
 
all :   $  (  name  )  . pdf
 
 $  (  name  )  . pdf :      *. tex  *. bib figures /*  
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        bibtex  $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  )

        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . aux  . blg  . log  . out  . synctex . gz ) 
 
distclean :               clean
        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . bbl  . pdf )  

 

  Internal hyperlinks  
 

 
You should always refer to figures, sections, theorems, etc. by label instead of by number. These labels are created by code like
 
  \begin  {   theorem   } 
 \   label   {  thm:my-theorem-name  } 
The statement of the theorem goes here.
 \end  {   theorem   }  

 
or
 
  \   section   {  Section title  } 
 \   label   {  sec:my-section-name  }  

 
etc. This helps keep the numbers matching up correctly when things get renumbered, but it can also be used to make internal hyperlinks so that clicking on the name of a thing will take you to the thing. To do this, include this in your preamble:
 
  \   usepackage   {  hyperref  }  

 
Then, instead of
 
 Theorem~ \   ref   {  thm:name-of-theorem  }  

 
(which is how you would refer to the label without hyperref), use
 
  \autoref  {  thm:name-of-theorem  }  

 
As well as making it easier to change a lemma to a theorem or “Figure” to “Fig.” (etc), this produces better hyperlinks: the link covers the whole “Theorem 3” text not just the number. In order to get this to work properly for labels that the package doesn't already know about, you may need additional preamble code like
 
  \   renewcommand   {   \sectionautorefname   }{  Section  }  

 
Labels also work for the items of an enumeration environment, but you may want to use \ref instead of \autoref for these, since the type of thing you want to call it (Case, Property, etc) will probably vary from one enumeration to another.
 

 

  Number lines for submissions  
 

 
It is convenient for paper reviewers to have line numbers to refer to when discussing proposed changes to your paper.
The easy way to do this is to put
 
  \   usepackage   {  lineno  }  

 
in the preamble, and to put
 
  \linenumbers  

 
 in the document itself, before the abstract.
 

 

  Less than and greater than signs in text mode  
 

 
With the default settings, LaTeX turns &lt; and &gt; in text-mode input into ¡ and ¿. This is usually just a minor annoyance (they should probably have been in math mode rather than text mode) but occasionally you really need them to render properly: for instance, when they are part of a DOI in a bibliography reference, where you don't have as much control over how to render them. The following magic code in your preamble causes them to be rendered properly:
 
  \   usepackage   [  T1  ]{  fontenc  }  

 
What this does is to change the way fonts are encoded in the output file (it has nothing to do with how TeX reads and processes your input); see  this link  for more details.
 

 

  Warn against bad formatting style and other issues  
 

 
You may have co-authors who still use outdated latex commands like \it when they should be using \emph, \$\$ … \$\$ when they should be using backslash-square-bracket, etc. To catch their errors, you can use
 
  \   usepackage   [  l2tabu, orthodox  ]{  nag  }  

 
It shouldn't change the output, but may produce a lot more warnings in the log file. And regardless of whether you're using this package, check the warnings and clear them up when possible.
 

 

  Visual vs geometric line breaking  
 

 
Include this in your preamble:
 
  \   usepackage   {  microtype  }  

 
It makes line breaks visual rather than geometric. That means the pixels don't exactly line up on the same vertical line as each other — the hyphens may hang out a little farther, etc. — but it ends up looking smoother. Also it makes it easier for LaTeX to avoid overfull hboxes.
 

 
See  this link  for details.
 

 

  Halmos box at the end of proofs  
 
  \   usepackage   {  amssymb  } 
 \   let   \doendproof  \endproof 
 \   renewcommand   \endproof  {  ~\  hfill   \qed  \doendproof   }  

 

  Named math operators  
 

 
If you have a variable or function that you're going to be using throughout much of your paper, it can help make things more readable and more consistent to give it a multi-letter name rather than just a single character. But, you should never be writing sequences of letters directly in math mode. Instead, you can do something like
 
  \DeclareMathOperator  {   \treewidth   }{  tw  }  

 
(in the amsmath package) and then whenever you want to use it do something like
 
  $ \treewidth (G)$  

 
You can also put text-mode formatting commands in the definition; for instance (for small caps)
 
  \DeclareMathOperator  {   \outerplanar   }{   \textsc  { outerplanar  }}  

 

  Separate bibliography for appendices  
 

 
For conference submissions with a page limit that counts bibliography pages, but an appendix that is not counted against the page limit, it is helpful to have a “References” section that only includes the references from the main text of the paper, and a separate “Additional References” section that lists the references that are from the appendix but not from the main paper text. Here's how. In the preamble, include
 
  \   usepackage   {  multibib  } 
 \newcites  {  appendix  }{  Additional References  }  

 
At the end of the main part of the paper and before the appendices, put your bibliography using the usual coding for it. Then, in the appendix, whenever you want to cite a reference that does not appear in the main part of the paper, use
 
  \citeappendix  {  GD-Handbook-13,BatEadTam-98,KauWag-01  }  

 
(Use this only for new references; use the usual cite command for references that are also in the main text. This may mean having a cite and a citeappendix command next to each other.) Finally, at the end of the appendix, add the code
 
  \bibliographystyleappendix  {  splncs  } 
 \bibliographyappendix  {  paper  }  

 
(with splncs replaced by your favorite bibliography style). This will cause a separate appendix.aux to be generated. When the references change, you will need to run
 
 bibtex appendix 

 
as well as the usual bibtex command for the main paper. For this extra level of complication in compiling everything it's helpful to use a makefile.
 

 

  LIPIcs format  
 

 
See  http://11011110.livejournal.com/300115.html  for some workarounds to issues with the LIPIcs conference format, including getting lineno to work, lemma numbering in appendices, and inability to use \autoref
 

 

  TeXShop and multiple files  
 

 
If you use TeXShop (a nice  OS  X graphical user interface front end for LaTeX) and have a project that has been split into multiple files, you should add the line

 
  % !TEX root = path/to/root.tex  

 

to the start of each file. That way, when you have a source file open, and use the command-key shortcut to compile it, it will compile your root file instead of the one you have open. The same code may work on some other front ends.
