				 Catalogue Description  
				117 Project in Software System Design (4). Specification, design, construction, testing, and documentation of 
                a complete software system using concepts learned in ICS 52, Informatics 101, and Informatics 111. Special 
                emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, careful planning, and other techniques for working with large 
                systems. 
				  
                 Prerequisites  
                ICS 51 with a grade of C or better; Informatics 101/CS 141/CSE141 and Informatics 111/CSE121; Mathematics 2A-B 
                and Statistics 67/Mathematics 67. Formerly ICS 125. (Exceptions may be granted, please talk to the instructor.)
				  
				 Add/Drop Policy  
				Given the interest in the class this quarter, and given the importance of starting as a team as soon as possible, 
                no adds or drops will be allowed after the  FIRST  week of classes.
                  
				 Grades  
				All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class attendance and participation, 
                (b) presentation(s) in class, (c) overall project, and (d) performance appraisals by team members.  You will 
                receive one overall grade at the end of the class; no partial grades will be given, nor will a particular 
                distribution be enforced among the above four.  You will, however, receive weekly feedback concerning your 
                progress.

				 Students with Disabilities  
				Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the 
				impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her 
				specific needs.  Also contact the Disability Services Center at 
				(949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such 
				accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
