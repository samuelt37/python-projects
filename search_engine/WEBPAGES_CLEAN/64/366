&gt;Good point. If what we're after here is not part of the interface
&gt;between web clients and servers, but rather a new interface
&gt;between web servers and CM systems, then URL syntax conventions
&gt;are fine: just like ?abc-1&amp;def-2 in CGI.

Hmmm.  This is, I think conflating two things again.  The
interface that the website developer/maintainer will be using is,
more than likely, going to be a web client.  Thus, whatever we
develop will involve the interaction between the web client and
the web server, and how that _maps onto_ the interaction between
the subsequent web server and its underlying VCS.
