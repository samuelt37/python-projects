   ABOUT STUDENT AFFAIRS 
    Vice Chair - Graduate Studies,  Ian Harris (fifth from left) at the new student welcome pizza social. 
 The Student Affairs Office (SAO) is staffed by nine professionals and several peer advisors  
who are committed to the success of our students, guiding them through important 
milestones and encouraging their timely progress to graduation. 
 In a typical year, SAO has approximately 3,600 advising contacts with undergraduates and 1,200 with graduate students. 
  Additionally, SAO hosts numerous special events for prospective and current students, fosters  
  student leadership and campus involvement, and encourages community among School 
  faculty and student scholars.  
 These efforts contribute to the School’s goals of attracting, retaining and graduating students whose accomplishments while at UCI – and later – reflect 
  the quality and scope of their Bren School of ICS education.
