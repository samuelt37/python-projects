" Contrasting Approaches of Two Environment Generators: The
Synthesizer Generator and Pan " ,
by Barbara Staudt Lerner in Technical Report 93-032,
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1993.

  Abstract  

The Synthesizer Generator and Pan are two popular environment generators.
While having the same basic goal of assisting in the development of
interactive environments, they use rather different mechanisms to reach
this goal.  Theis paper discusses the three basic descriptive components
used in environment generation: syntactic, semantic, and user interface
descriptions.  The contrasting approaches of the Synthesizer Generator
and Pan are presented, along with a discussion of the consequences
resulting from their respective mechanisms.
