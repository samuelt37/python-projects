 On The Duel Representation Of Non-Binary Semiring-Based CSP's

 Abstract  
It is well known that any non-binary CSP can be reformulated as a binary CSP. 
In this paper we show that the same translation methods can be applied in the 
soft constraints framework. We observe that any non-binary soft constraint CSP 
can be reformulated as a problem with only binary and unary constraints. 
Interestingly, the translation leads to binary constraints that are hard 
(define conditions of mandatory satisfaction) and unary constraints that are 
soft (define a preference criterion among the set of solutions). 
We elaborate our observation in the semiring based framework.
