 Stream Buffer<body>

  Stream Buffer  
      Mainly used to eliminate compulsory/capacity misses
 
     Prediction: if a memory address is missed, the consecutive address is likely to be missed in near future
 
     Scenario for prediction to be useful: stream access
 
     Architecture implementation: when an address miss, prefetch consecutive address into on-chip buffer. When there is a hit in stream buffer, prefetch the consecutive address of the hit address.
