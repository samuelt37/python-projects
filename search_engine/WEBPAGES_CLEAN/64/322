 Abstract  
Looking ahead during search is often useful when solving constraint satisfaction problems.
Previous studies have shown that looking ahead helps by causing dead-ends to occur earlier in
the search, and by providing information that is useful for dynamic variable ordering. In this
paper, we show that another benefit of looking ahead is a useful domain value ordering
heuristic, which we call look-ahead value ordering or LVO. LVO counts the number of times
each value of the current variable con icts with some value of a future variable, and the value
with the lowest number of con icts is chosen first. Our experiments show that look-ahead
value ordering can be of substantial benefit, especially on hard constraint satisfaction problems.
