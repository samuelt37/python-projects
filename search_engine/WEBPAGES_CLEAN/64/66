 Twenty researchers from all over the world participated in the virtual poster session of the  5th Workshop on Massive Multiuser Virtual Environments  (MMVE 2012). The workshop was held in Munich, Germany, on October 9. The virtual session was hosted by the Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds using an  OpenSimulator  server featuring  Vivox  for voice and with content from the  Universal Campus . 
    
     
 Seven posters were on display, with three of them being presented live in the virtual world. The group also engaged in an open-ended conversation about the future of the workshop and the research community around massive multiuser virtual environments.     
   
 The virtual poster session was considered a success, and plans are being made to continue these virtual meetings throughout the year. Stay tuned!
