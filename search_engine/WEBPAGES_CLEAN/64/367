 Research on Topic Models for Text Data: Quick Pointers <body>


 
 Topic Models for Text Data: Quick Pointers to Various Resources  
 


  
Note that 
on 
 
Dave Blei's page on topic modeling resources   is much more up to date than this one! See also Dave's 
 
topic modeling mailing list .
    Topic Modeling Softare  
  
 
MATLAB software . A comprehensive MATLAB software package from
Mark Steyvers and Tom Griffiths, using collapsed Gibbs sampling.
  
 
David Blei's Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) code in C , using
variational learning.
  
Andrew McCallum and his group have implemented topic modeling as part of the more general
 
MALLET toolkit for  statistical text analysis .
  
Jonathan Chang's 
 
R package for topic models , using collapsed Gibbs sampling.
  
Alex Smola and Shravan Narayanmurthy's
 
very fast LDA implementation on Hadoop  that can "quite comfortably handle a billion documents" (!) according to Alex.
     
   
Introductory Papers on Topic Models  
   
 
Probabilistic Topic Models ,
Steyvers and Griffiths (2006). A review paper on topic
modeling that is a useful starting point for
covering the basic concepts, with illustrative examples.
   
 
Topic Models , Blei and Lafferty (2009). Another very useful starting point for topic modeling.
     
   
Examples of Web Browsers built using Topic Models  
  
[currently down] A topic-based browser of 
 
UCI and UCSD faculty research interests  built
by Dave Newman and Arthur Asuncion at UCI in 2005.
   [currently down]
A topic-based browser for
 
330,000 New York Times articles , by Dave Newman, UCI.
  
Wray Buntine's
 
topic-based search interface to Wikipedia .
  
Dave Blei and John Lafferty's 
 
browsable 100-topic model of journal articles from Science .
