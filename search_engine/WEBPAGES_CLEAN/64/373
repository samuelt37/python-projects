3.31.3 BuildExpressions
 
   
virtual bool BuildExpressions(unsigned int atomopts, unsigned int bondopts)
    
This method builds query expressions for the atoms and bonds contained
in a query molecule instance.  Any pre-existing query expressions are
destroyed by this method.  The bits in the unsigned integers passed to
the method define how query expressions will be built based on the
attributes of each atom and bond instance.  The bitwise options are
stored in the OEExprOpts namespace.  Please refer to
(Section  8.4 ) for a complete explanation of the query
options.  This method provides the ability to convert attributes of
base atoms and bonds to query expressions that are consistent with the
semantics desired for a graph match procedure.  Each requested
expression is constructed, using data from the parent atom or bond if
necessary.  During a graph match procedure, the resulting expression
composition will be used to evaluate atom and bond graph component
equivalences.

  
It is important to note that BuildExpressions uses the data present in
a query molecule only when it is called.  Subsequent modifications to
atom and bond data to not cause the expressions to be updated to
reflect changes.  An additional call to BuildExpressions must be made
to synchronize expressions with atom and bond data.
