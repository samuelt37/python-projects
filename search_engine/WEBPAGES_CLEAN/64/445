Description:
Each line is a data sample. Each sample contains variables related to jet kinematics, tracks, vertex and high level features.
Each track contains 20 variables and each sample has a variable number of tracks.
Each vertex contains 8 variables and each sample has a variable number of vertices.
For each sample there are 14 high level variables.
Each sample has an associated weight which has to be used for sample re-weighting to balance the distributions of types samples. Two jets with weight 0.5 have the same importance in the training as a single jet with weight 1.0.

The variables can be subdivided into 3 categories; low level, medium level and high level. Each one of these is constructed strictly using information from the previous level so low level
