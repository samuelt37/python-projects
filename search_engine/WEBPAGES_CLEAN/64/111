&gt;You know, it might very well be that the right conception of both

&gt;I especially like the idea of a "checkin" data object that could work

   I don't have a problem with this, except that we have HTTP PUT, and the
versioning stuff must work with it (to my mind, PUT is un-useful without
versioning, but that is (perhaps) only my problem). If we move all the
versioning stuff into a special content-type that must be processed,
versioning updates will be implemented differently from non-versioning
updates. This will reduce the ability of versioning to work with legacy
authoring environments, and _require_ special work for versioning to be
supported at all.

   I think this violates some of the requirements, unless we remove PUT,
define POST as "form-only" and make all updates use a content-type (w/
simple options that allow versioning).

   I liked the multipart/HTTP you suggested for transactions, but that's a
CM and not a versioning issue. I think that we agree that CM support will
not work well will legacy software, except insofar as we can support the
update of single resources.
