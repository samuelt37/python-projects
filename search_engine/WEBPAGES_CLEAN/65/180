  Euler's Formula,
Proof 5: Divide and Conquer
 

This proof was sent to me by Alex Bogomolny, who found it in a Russian
translation (1958) of the 7th edition of
 J. Hadamard's Elementary Geometry  (vol 2).  It
is closely related to the proof by
 ear decomposition .

 
The proof is by induction on the number of faces.  First of all, you
remove one face and prove the formula V-E+F=1 for open polyhedral
surfaces. For a single face the formula obviously holds. Assume the
formula holds for a smaller than F number of faces and consider a
surface with number of faces equal to F. Pick two vertices on the
boundary (left by the removed face) of the surface and connect them by a
chain of internal edges. (The existence of such a chain follows by a
form of the Jordan curve theorem.) Now cut along this chain. You get two
surfaces for which the formula V-E+F=1 holds.  For the first let it be
V1-E1+F1=1 and for the second V2-E2+F2=1.  Assume the chain contains L
edges hence (L+1) vertices.  It then follows that E1+E2=E+L and
V1+V2=V+L+1. Of course F1+F2=F.  Summing (algebraically) up gives the
desired result.
 

One can also use a dual version of the proof, in which an open disk
(initially formed by removing a vertex from the polyhedron) is
decomposed by finding alternating sequences of edges and faces.
