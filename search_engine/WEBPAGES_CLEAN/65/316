  Wayne  Hayes</strong>  Associate Professor</strong>  DEGREE: Ph.D. 2001, University of Toronto  RESEARCH AREAS:  Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology Scientific and Numerical Computing  RESEARCH INTERESTS:  Dr. Hayes' primary interest is currently in testing the reliability of large-scale physical simulations such as galaxy and cosmological n-body simulations as performed by astronomers.  More generally, he is interested in rigorous verification of numerical solutions of differential equation systems using validated interval arithmetic. He is also interested in combinatorial graph theory, for example in bounding the Graph Ramsey Numbers.  CONTACT INFORMATION:
