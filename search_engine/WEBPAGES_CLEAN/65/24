 LBAK-Tree 
 Introduction 
 
This module provides  l</strong>ocation- b</strong>ased  a</strong>pproximate  k</strong>eyword search.   
 
For example, it can answer queries such as  find Alkatras near San Fransisco</strong>. Notice that  Alkatras</strong> is misspelled but the LBAK-Tree can still find useful answers.
In short, the LBAK-Tree answers queries with a spatial component and a keyword component, where the keywords don't need to match exactly but approximately.
 
 Overview 
 
The LBAK-Tree is based on a hierarchical spatial index that is enhanced with inverted indexes for approximate string lookups. In our implementation we use an R*-Tree as spatial index and use the FilterTreeDoc module (part of Flamingo) to implement the inverted indexes for approximate string lookups.
 
 
Our paper  Supporting Location-Based Approximate-Keyword Queries</strong> describes three variants of the LBAK-Tree which differ in where they place inverted indexes in the spatial index. This module contains all their implementations:
 
 Fixed-Level (FL) 
  Inverted indexes are placed at one level in the R*-Tree
   
  
 Variable-Level (VL) 
  Inverted indexes can be placed at different levels in the R*-Tree
   
  
 Variable-Level Exploiting Keyword Frequencies (VLF) 
  Inverted indexes are placed at various levels, 
  Keyword-frequencies are exploited to improve performance
   
  
 
Please have a look at  example.cc</strong> in the lbaktree/src folder to get started!
