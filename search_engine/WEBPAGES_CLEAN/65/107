 The Maximum-Mean Subtree and other Bicriterion Subtree Problems 

 Presented by Josiah Carlson 

 
Abstract:
  
We cover a general method for solving Bicriterion Subtree problems;
the Parametric Linear Maximum Subtree.  We then discuss our improvement
to a special case of this algorithm, and the implications of our
solutions to these problems.
