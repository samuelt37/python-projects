 Hyperwebs Tab 

 The display shows a hierarchy of folder and document icons that represent the hyperwebs on this website. A folder icon denotes a node that has children while a document icon represents a node with no children. Each node is a complete hyperweb of anchors and links. A child hyperweb also has access to the anchors and links stored in its ancestors. 

 The hostname of the website is the root node of the hierarchy. All hyperwebs share this node as their common ancestor (which is the only node which does not have a set of anchors and links associated with it). This arrangement enables a mapping between a hyperweb and a URL. For instance, a leaf node  web1.1  whose parent is  web1  whose parent is the root node has an associated URL of &lt;http://host.domain.com/web1/web1.1/&gt;. A user can use this URL to browse the web in a Web browser provided that the host's Web server is properly configured. 

   

 Displaying the hyperweb hierarchy 

 To display the children of a node, double click on it. Double click again to hide the node's children. 

 Variations between Look-and-Feels 

  The Metal Look-and-Feel is sensitive to the location of the mouse with respect to double clicks. The cursor must be exactly above the folder in order to work correctly.
  The CDE/Motif Look-and-Feel requires only a click on the plus symbol to open the folder, and a click on the minus symbol to close it.
