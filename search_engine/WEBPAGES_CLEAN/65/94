 Abstract 
 

 
In this paper we present a new paradigm for entity search on the Web. Searching for entities, such as people, on the Web is today done using keyword based search, which leaves the burden of disambiguating and collecting pages relevant to a particular entity (from among the namesakes) on the user. We develop an approach in which a search for a name returns a set of clusters of Web pages grouped based on their association to a "real" person. Our method exploits variety of semantic information extracted from Web pages to disambiguate among namesakes referred to on the Web pages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing both the efficacy of the disambiguation algorithms and also its impact on entity search.
