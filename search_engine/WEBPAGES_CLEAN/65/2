We study  finite element mesh  smoothing
problems in which we
move vertex locations to optimize the shapes of nearby
triangles.  Many such problems can be solved in linear time using
 generalized linear programming ; we also give
efficient
algorithms for some non-LP-type mesh smoothing problems.
One lemma may be of independent interest: the locus of points in R d 
from which a d-1 dimensional convex set subtends a given solid angle
is convex.
