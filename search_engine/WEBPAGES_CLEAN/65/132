         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The  next statement is used to prematurely terminate the
current iteration of a  while, for  or infinite  loop :
 for I in 0 to 7 loop
  if SKIP = '1' then
    next;
  else
    N_BUS &lt;= TABLE(I);
    wait for 5 ns;
  end if;
end loop;
  
    
  

 
    The next statement may test a boolean condition directly, using the
 when  keyword:
 process (A)
begin
   Z &lt;= "0000";
   for I in 0 to 3 loop 
      next when A /= I;
      Z(I) &lt;= '1';
   end loop; 
end process;
  
    
  

 
    For a next statement within a set of nested loops, the optional loop
label may be used to indicate which level of loop is to be iterated. The
default (no label) is the innermost loop. If an outer loop is specified,
loops inside are effectively exited:
 READ_BUS: process
begin
  RESETLOOP: loop
    VALID_CHECK: while 
      (CPU_DATA_VALID /= '1') loop
        wait until rising_edge(CLK)
                   or RESET = '1';
        next RESETLOOP when RESET='1';
    end loop VALID_CHECK;
    CPU_DATA_READ &lt;= '1';
    wait until rising_edge(CLK);
    LOCAL_BUFFER &lt;= DATA_BUS;
    wait until rising_edge(CLK);
    CPU_DATA_READ &lt;= '0';
  end loop RESETLOOP;
end process READ_BUS;
  
    
  



 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

The next statement is supported by some logic synthesis tools, with
certain restrictions.

 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, the  next  statement may have an optional label:  
labelL  next  loop_label;
