      Hybrid Tree Code (main memory version) 
     
     
        
     
      Hybrid Tree code  .
     After downloading the file (on a SUN SPARC 
machine running Solaris), first do "gunzip htree.tar.gz" 
and then do "tar xvf htree.tar". 
      The   README   file describes how to
compile, run and customize the code. Please read it before compiling/running
the code.
     For more information, please read the paper 
on   Hybrid Tree   or
contact   kaushik@ics.uci.edu  .
     To understand how multipoint queries and arbitrary distance functions 
(e.g., arbitrary Lp metric with arbitrary weight along each dimension)
are handled in the hybrid tree, please read sections 2 and 3 of the paper 
on   query refinement  .
     To run query refinement on top of hybrid tree, download 
  this   code. The code contains
a   README_relfeed   file that describes
how to run the code along with the hybrid tree code. Note that 
the refinement code would not work unless you have downloaded the 
hybrid tree code (from above).
     Among others, the hybrid tree code is being used by:
   Prof. Hyo Jong Lee and his students at Chonbuk National University in Korea

   Dave Thomas at AdInjection.com for a project in his company

   Dr. Progress Q. T. Mtshali for student projects
data mining class at the Nova Southeastern University .

   Devasis Bassu at Telcordia Technologies

   Huang Wu at the National University of Singapore for his research work

   OuYang WeiMin at Anhui University, China for research

   Dang Tran Khanh at Johannes Kepler Universitï¿½t Linz

   Database Lab at University of California at Riverside for research
