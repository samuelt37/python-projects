8.4.4 FormalCharge 
 

 
Formal charge flag.  When set, the values returned by the
OEAtomBase::GetFormalCharge method of the query atom and potential
graph match will be tested for equivalence, if the formal charge on
the query atom is non-zero.  If the formal charge of the query atom is
zero no test will be performed.
