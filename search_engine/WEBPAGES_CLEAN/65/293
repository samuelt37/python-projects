Commutative version of the local Hamiltonian problem and common
eigenspace problem
 
  Jenny Lam  

 
We study the complexity of a problem "Common Eigenspace": verifying
consistency of eigenvalue equations for composite quantum systems. The
input of the problem is a family of pairwise commuting Hermitian operators
 H  1 , ...,  H r   on a
Hilbert space ( C   d  ) ⊗n  and a
string of real numbers λ 1 , ...,
λ  r  . The problem is to determine whether
the common eigenspace specified by equalities  H a  
|ψ&gt; = λ  a   |ψ&gt; for  a  = 1,
...,  r  has a positive dimension. We consider two cases:
   all operators  H a  
are  k -local; 
 all operators  H a   are
factorized. 
 It can be easily shown that both problems belong to the class QMA,
a quantum analogue of NP, and that some NP-complete problems can be
reduced to either (i) or (ii). A non-trivial question is whether the
problems (i) or (ii) belong to NP? We show that the answer is positive
for some special values of  k  and  d . Also we prove that the
problem (ii) can be reduced to its special case, such that all operators
 H a   are factorized projectors and
all λ  a   = 0. (Based on  a paper 
by Sergey Bravyi and Mikhail Vyalyi in  Quantum Inf. and Comp.  2005.)
