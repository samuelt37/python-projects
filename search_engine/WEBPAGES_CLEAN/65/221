            G.I.G.: Guitar Chord Applet    
        
           
                The Ultimate G.I.G.      Guitar Intelli-Generator (G.I.G.)  is a top-notch guitar applet that can find and display virtually any specifiable chord in any tuning with any capo position. Whether you are a neophyte or a maestro in playing the guitar, G.I.G. can enhance your chord vocabulary and compositional skills. G.I.G. includes Composer 1.0, which is a simple MIDI scratch pad that can record virtually any guitar progression. Composer 1.0 can play the sequence with a variety of strumming and picking patterns. And best of all, G.I.G. and Composer 1.0 are free to use!  Okay, that's enough for promotion. If you have any interest in playing the guitar, I would invite you to use this guitar applet, which I have been working on since summer. I got the idea to write an 'intelligent' guitar applet when I took ICS 171 (Artificial Intelligence) in the summer. G.I.G. has shown me some chord positions that I had never thought of before.  G.I.G. is pretty complicated, so it's good to read the  G.I.G. manual  first.  Also, you might want to visit the  Guitar Factory page  to learn some different strumming and picking patterns.
