 Programming Assignments 
 
  ICS-33: Intermediate Programming   
  

  Procedures 
 
Programming assignments are typically due about two weeks after they are
  assigned, at 11:30pm, typically on a Tuesday night (but look for exceptions).
To turn in programs, and verify the submission, use the
   
  Checkmate Homework Dropoff  system: it is also available on the
  standard frame index on the course website: it uses UCInetID Secure Web
  Login.
You receive  NO POINTS  for late programs, unless you have discussed the
  matter with me and gotten my official permission (typically, granted
  well-prior to the due date-not at the last minute- always via email, and not
  just orally; contact me as soon as possible).
  
 IN ALL CASES, you must drop off (on time) whatever part of the program you
  have written , if you are to receive any partial credit for a submission
  (either on time or late with permission); if you drop off  no  files, I
   must assume that you have done  no  work on the assignment (which will
  result in a grade of 0 for it).
  


  Pair Programming 
We will use  pair programming  on most assignments ( recommended ,
  although it is sometimes  prohibited ); it is only
  on these assignments that students can closely collaborate with their
  partners, turning in one copy of a jointly written program.
See  Pair Programming  for
  details about pair programming, and the right and wrong ways to do it.
There is a tremendous amount to be gained by both partners, if they pair
  program the right way: both students working together,  not  splitting-up
  the assignment.
 
You can keep the same partner for multiple assignments or switch.
Try to find a partner in your lab who has approximately your skill level and
  study habits (e.g., working evening vs. weekends, work ethic to submit
  programs early); try to find someone who lives near you (or with whom you
  can easily meet outside lab) because I expect partners will need time outside
  labs to finish the programs.
You may partner with someone in a different lab, but you both must be able to
  attend (and actually attend) one of your labs for 4 hours/week.
I recommend finding a partner when you are attending your lab, but there is
  also a MessageBoard Forum for this task.
  


  Starting/Finishing Programs 
Please read each assignment completely and carefully before starting it.
I suggest that you print and then read it, marking relevant material with a
  highlighter (details that you might forget by the end of an assignment).
Then, re-read the assignment before submitting your work.
Programs are typically assigned on Tuesday and due two weeks later on the
  following Tuesday, when the next program is assigned; students should plan to
  have finished their current programs on Monday, so they can start on the new
  programs in lab on Tuesday; see below for how this leads to extra credit.
 

  Extra Points for Submitting Early 
If you drop off your program early, you will receive extra points (1 point if
  you submit it 24 hours early, 2 points if you submit it 48 hours early).
Since each program is worth 50 points, you can raise your grade on a program
  by 4% (almost half a letter grade) by turning it in two days early.
Note that turning in a program more than two days early still results in just
  2 extra points: the maximum you can get for an early turn-in.
 

  Identifying Submissions 

Only  ONE STUDENT  should submit the assignment (all parts of it).
If students work in pairs,  BOTH NAMES  and their UCInetID names must
  appear in a comment at the top of each submitted program.
For example if Romeo Montague (whose UCInetID is romeo1) submitted a program
  that he worked on with his partner Juliet Capulet (whose UCInetID is jcapulet)
  the comment at the top of each .py file would appear as:
  # Submitter: romeo1(Montague, Romeo)
# Partner  : jcapulet(Capulet, Juliet)
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming  
If you do not know what the terms  cooperatively  and/or
   rules for pair programming  mean, please read about
   Pair Programming  
  before starting this assignment.
 
If the names do not appear at the top of all your submissions in exactly this
  form, points will be deducted.
If you are submitting by yourself, you may omit all lines but the first
  ( Submitter ).


  Multiple Submissions 
Checkmate allows students to remove a submission and then resubmit.
We will grade only your final submission (and extra credit points are based on
  only that submission).
For assignments with multiple parts, please turn in each part
   as you finish it , so that I can accurately assess the progress of the
  class as a whole during this assignment.
If you discover something wrong with your code after you submit it, you can
  always correct the code, remove the old code, and resubmit the new code.
 

  No Retrieval 
Students cannot retrieve a submission from Checkmate; so, you are responsible
  for archiving your work so that you have a copy of what you submit.
Also, ensure that you turn in the correct (most up to date) version of your
  code.
