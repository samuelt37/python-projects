Routing in highly dynamic network communities
 
Amitabha Bagchi
 
 
The advent of large freely-evolving networks has led to a new notion
of computing in communities. These communities share resources to
achieve shared or individual goals. Unlike the rigidly organized
parallel systems of the past, these networks have relatively looser
interconnection regimes and allow, in fact expect, nodes and edges to
come and go as they please. We study the ability of networks to deal
with this highly dynamic situation by looking at the basic problem of
routing. We use the edge expansion of the network (roughly the number
of edges per node going out of a given set of nodes) as our measure
of
the ability to route packets efficiently. We study the effect if
nodes
leaving the system on the expansion of the network.  We also propose
a
system of routing flows through disjoint paths to provide robustness
against edges going down and analyze it in terms of the expansion.
