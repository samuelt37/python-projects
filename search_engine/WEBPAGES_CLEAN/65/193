			 B0478/S024 

			 
				 This is equivalent to rule
				 B012357/S23567 . 

				 In this rule, patterns formed by 2x2 blocks of cells
				simulate a simpler cellular automaton that applies the following
				rules to each 2x2 neighborhood: 
				   0 0 0 0 
						   
						 1 
						    
						 0 0 0 1 
						   
						 0 
						    
						 0 0 1 1 
						   
						 0 
						    
						 0 1 1 0 
						   
						 1 
						    
						 1 1 1 0 
						   
						 0 
						    
						 1 1 1 1 
						   
						 0 
					   One glider is listed: 
				   Glider 35 , size 3x2, speed c/4, diagonal
