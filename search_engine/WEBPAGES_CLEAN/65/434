         What do you do on the project?  I'm doing a lot of the evaluation for this project, like conducting interviews with our subjects, collecting and analyzing the data, and thinking of questions to ask in the interviews. I also did some sound coding. 

  How long have you been with the group?  I think since April or May, whenever [EcoRaft] started. 

  Why are you working on the project?  Because I want to--I thought it was interesting because I saw Bill [Tomlinson's] past work and wanted to be a part of it, and I'm glad I asked to be in it. I'm mostly working on it for experience and grad school. 

  What do you think is the overall goal of the project?  To educate our subjects, or just people in general, people who experience the project and get something out of it. 

  What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project? I guess interacting with our subjects (the kids), like at Discovery Science Center. That was really cool, so I'm looking forward to do that at SIGGRAPH. 

  What are your career goals/interests?  I kind of want to be in the medical field, because it seems interesting to me, but I'm also leaning towards bioinformatics. 

  What are the other projects you've worked on?  [EcoRaft] is my first research project. 

  Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?  Not yet. 

  Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?  I guess that's it.
