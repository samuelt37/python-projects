16.11 OEOpenOStream 
 
   
oeostream *OEOpenOStream(const char *target)
    
Creates and returns an oeostream capable of writing to the specified
 target  parameter. The  target  parameter is initially parsed to
determine whether a colon delimited protocol was specified. If no protocol was
specified, it is assumed that the  target  parameter refers to a filename.
If a protocol was specified, the function checks to see whether an output
stream allocator and deallocator have been registered to handle to the
appropriate protocol. If the specified protocol has been registered, the
appropriate output stream will be created and returned, otherwise the function
will return 0. Allocators and deallocators for specific protocols can be
registered using the  OEPlatform::OERegisterOStream  function.

  
Example:
    
oeostream *os = OEOpenOStream("pipe: uniq &gt; output.txt");
    
In addition, this function will attempt to assess whether or not the output
data target expects compressed data. If the expected format is supported, the
appropriate compression wrapper stream will be used to dynamically compress the
data.

  
All streams created with this function MUST be closed with the
 OEPlatform::OECloseOStream  function.
