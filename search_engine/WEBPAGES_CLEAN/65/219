 A New Algorithm for Sampling CSP Solutions Uniformly at Random 

 Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a method for generating solutions of a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) uniformly at random. Our method relies on expressing
the constraint network as a uniform probability distribution over its solutions
and then sampling from the distribution using state-of-the-art probabilistic sampling
schemes. To speed up the rate at which random solutions are generated, we
augment our sampling schemes with pruning techniques used successfully in the
CSP literature such as conflict-directed back-jumping and no-good learning.
