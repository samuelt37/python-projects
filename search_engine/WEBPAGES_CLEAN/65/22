         What do you do on the project?  I started off working primarily on the computer game version, but I kind of got pulled away, so now I'm just working on various programming tasks for the installation project. 

  How long have you been with the group?  I started around January or February. 

  Why are you working on the project?  Probably for experience. 

  What do you think is the overall goal of the project?  To make a life-changing exhibit about ecological restoration to teach kids. 

  What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?  I guess getting to work with all the people here and getting to go to the Discovery Science Center and playing with the kids. 



  Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?  Not yet. 

  Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?  I don't think so.
