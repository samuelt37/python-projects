code v. model comparisons difficult



       Diagram editing OK but somewhat clumsy

 

      Text often cut-off or drawn outside of box

  No alignment tools or back-to-front ordering

         Table-of-contents widget aids users in finding individual elements, but that is all

 

         Rose 98i fixes some of the most offensive usability problems of earlier versions (e.g., not being able to resize the property dialog)
