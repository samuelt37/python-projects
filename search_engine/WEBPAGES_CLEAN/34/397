 Abstract  
We address the problem of enumerating (producing) all models of a given theory.
We show that the enumeration task can be performed in time proportional to the
product of the number of models and the effort needed to generate each model in 
isolation. In other words, the requirement of generating a new solution in each iteration
does not in itself introduce substantial complexity. Consequently, it is possible to
decide whether any tractably satisfiable formula has more than K solutions in time
polynomial in the size of the formula and in K. In the special cases of Horn formulas
and 2-CNFs, although counting is #P-complete, to decide whether the count exceeds
K, is polynomial in K.
