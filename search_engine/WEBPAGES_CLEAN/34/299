Entropy Coding
 

 Josiah Carlson, UCI 

 
 Abstract: 
  
In this survey talk we will offer an introduction with brief
explanations of historic entropy coders; from the symbol-based
Shannon, Huffman, and Arithmetic approaches, to the "modern" LZ77, 78, and LZW
pattern matching algorithms.  With luck, we will have time to discuss
data transformation approaches with FFT/DCT and BWT. In this survey
