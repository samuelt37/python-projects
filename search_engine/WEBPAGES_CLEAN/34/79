 This data is a subset of the Million Song Dataset:  http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/  a collaboration between LabROSA (Columbia University) and The Echo Nest. Prepared by T. Bertin-Mahieux tb2332  '@'  columbia.edu&gt; 

   Data Set Information:  
 You should respect the following train / test split: train: first 463,715 examples test: last 51,630 examples It avoids the 'producer effect' by making sure no song from a given artist ends up in both the train and test set. 

   Attribute Information:  
 90 attributes, 12 = timbre average, 78 = timbre covariance The first value is the year (target), ranging from 1922 to 2011. Features extracted from the 'timbre' features from The Echo Nest API. We take the average and covariance over all 'segments', each segment being described by a 12-dimensional timbre vector.
