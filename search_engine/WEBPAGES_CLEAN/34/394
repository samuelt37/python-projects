We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.
  
The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.
