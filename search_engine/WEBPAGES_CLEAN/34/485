            Guitar Progressions    
        
           
                ii - V - iii - VI Progression and Variations</strong>   This is currently my favorite chord progression. In the key of  G</strong>, the progression would go:  Am - D - Bm - Em</strong>  Some people call the  Am - D - Bm </strong>progression a  deceptive cadence , since the  Am</strong> followed by a  D</strong> would normally resolve to a  G</strong> (known as the  tonic ). However, going to the  Bm</strong> and then the  Em</strong> gives a feeling of delay and irresolution. Thus, looping this progression over and over again drives the listener to keep on listening in hopes of resolution.  The background sound clip on my  music page  has this progression. The "So Amazed" song (also at my music page) follows this progression also. I eventually resolve this song on an E though.  If you play the guitar, you might be interested in some variations: --With Bass Line:  Am - Am/G - D - D/C - Bm - Bm/F# - Em - Em/B</strong> --With Diminished:  Am - Cdim7 - Bm - Em</strong> --With 2 Diminished:  C - C#dim7 - Bm - Bdim7</strong>  Have fun!

            Passion of the Christ    
        
           
                Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" continues to skyrocket at the box office.</strong> Over 5 days, "The Passion" has raked in $125.2 million, beating out "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" ($124.1 million), and  setting the record for the greatest debut ever  for a Wednesday-opening movie.  I saw "The Passion" last Saturday at a special screening, and I must say that it is one of the most powerful movies that I have ever seen (I hardly go out to see movies, but that's tangential). Basically this movie is about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ. It depicts the amount of suffering that He went through, from the scourging to the crucifixion. The script is Biblically accurate for the most part (although there were some artistic liberties taken in scenes involving Judas Iscariot, and a "crow"). If you have not watched this movie yet, I would strongly encourage you to watch it (be warned that it is violent though). You will have a better appreciation of the sacrifice that Jesus went through on the cross to save us from our sins, and you will witness the unsearchable depth of God's love for you.  Christ said: Greater love has no man than this, than he lay down his life for his friends.
