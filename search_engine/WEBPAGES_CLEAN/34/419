bool OE3DToAtomStereo(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
Set the stereochemistry at the chiral atoms of a molecule, as
specified by the molecule's 3D coordinates.  The affected atoms are
those with a ``chiral'' atom property of true, as discovered by an
earlier call to OEPerceiveChiral, or set manually by the user calling
the OEAtomBase::SetChiral method.
