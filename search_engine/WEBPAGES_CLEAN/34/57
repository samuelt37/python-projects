        The Structure and Evaluation of Expressions  
 
   In this section we begin our examination of how to build simple and
     complicated expressions from literals, names, operators, functions, and
     methods.
   The EBNF rules specifying the structure of expressions are overly 
     complicated, so instead we will just describe their syntax in English
     (one of the few times we shall do so).
   Here are the three structural rules for expressions; each rule concerns
     the syntax of legal expressions.
     S1 : A literal is a legal expression
       S2 : A (variable) name is a legal expression; its type.
       S3 : An operator (or function or method) whose operands (each of
          which must be a legal expression) is a legal expression.
    
  We will be interested in computing the type of the object resulting from an
   expression, which we can determine if we know the types of its literals,
   (variable) names and the prototpyes/annotations of its operators, functions,
   and methods.
   
  For each syntax rule there is a companion semantic rule for  evaluating 
    expressions.
  In some sense, each expression is a question, "What is the value of ..."
    which Python answers by evaluating the expression.
      E1 : A literal evaluates to itself (a trivial but noteworthy
          rule, for the sake of completeness).
       E2 : A name evaluates to the current object it is bound to
          (refers to it).
       E3 : An operator (or function or method)
      Evaluates each of its operands or arguments (which are themselves
              legal expressions).
          Performs any implicit conversions
            (e.g., promoting  int  to  float  or  bool  to
             int  for arithmetic on mixed types
          Applies the operator to its operands (or calls the function or
              method on its arguments) to to compute its result, which is based
              on the semantics of that operator, function, or method.
                
  Here, as above,  E1  and  E2  are simple rules; all the power is
    in rule  E3 .
   
  For example, assume that we assign  x = 3  in a script and then
    want to determine whether the expression  3*x+1  is a legal expression
   (and what its resulting type and value is).
  Here is a proof in English that this expression is legal and has the value
     10 .
     We can prove that  3  is a legal expression (by  S1 );
          its value is  3  (by  E1 ) whose type is  int .
      We can prove that  x  is a legal expression (by  S2 );
          its value is  3  (by  E2 ) whose type is  int .
      We can prove that  3*x  is a legal expression (by  S3 :
          we just proved both  3  and  x  are legal
          expressions of type  int , and one of the prototypes of
           *  is  (int,int) -&gt; int ); its result value is  9 
          (by  E3  and applying the semantics of the multiply operator)
          whose type if  int .
      We can prove that  1  is a legal expression (by  S1 ); its
           value is  1  (by  E1 ) whose type is  int .
      Finally, we can prove that  3*x+1  is a legal expression
         (by  S3 : we just proved both  3*x  and
           1  are legal expressions of type  int , and one of the
          prototypes of  +  is  + (int,int) -&gt; int ); its result
          value is  10  (by  E3  again, and applying the semantics
          of the add operator) whose type if  int .
    
  In fact, these three rules allow us to identify the structure of -and
    evaluate- arbitrarily complicated expressions built from literals,
    (variable) names, operators, functions, and methods.
 
           Oval Diagrams  
 
  To illustate that we understand how Python structures and evaluates our
    expressions (and more importantly, to give us a tool to analyze and debug
    incorrectly written expressions), we will study how to illustrate an
    expression as an  Oval  diagram.
  As we write expressions with many operators, functions, and methods mixing
    many types, this tool will become more and more important.
   
  To create an oval diagram, first circle (or draw an oval around) every 
    literal and (variable) name in the expression.
  These expressions are like atoms in chemistry: they contain no smaller
    constituents.
  Next, label their values on the bottoms and the types on these values on the
    top.
  Then, draw an oval around each operator and its operands (or each function or
    method and its arguments); label the bottom with the result value (using
    the semantics of the operator, function, or method) and the top with its
    type.
    
  The outermost oval is labelled by the value and type of the result of the
    entire expression.
  Here is an example of an oval diagram for the previously discussed expression:  3*x+1  with  x  bound to  3 .
  
   
  
           Operator Precedence and Associativity  
 
  Examine the oval diagram below.
  It has exactly the same tokens as the oval diagram above, but the ovals are
     a bit different.
  They both seem to "follow all the rules" for forming/evaluating expressions,
    but the ovals are in different positions, and they ultimately produce
    different values as a result.
  The questions are: which oval diagram is correct (which is the way Python
     analyzes and evaluates expressions) and what extra rules do we need to
     know about to  construct correct oval diagrams?
     
  
        &amp;nbsp  
 
  The answers have to do with the concepts of "operator precedence" and
   "operator associativity": which operators take precedence over other
    operators (which operators are circled/evaluated first) in an expression.
  During this discussin we will learn that we can also use parentheses to
    override the standard operator precedence/associativity when we need to.
  Here is an operator precedence/association table that includes all the
    operators in Python -some we know, others will be covered later- in
    highest to lowest precedence.
 
       Operator  Name  Associativity 
         () [] {}    Grouping or tuple, list, set/dictionary   
     x.attr, x(...), x[...]    Attribute, call, index/slice   
     x**y    Power (exponentiation)  Right 
     -x +x ~x    Positive, negative, bit-wise not   
     * % / //    Multiply/repetition, remainder/formatting, divide, floor divide  Left 
     + -    Add/catenation, subtract/set-difference  Left 
     x&lt;&lt;y x&gt;&gt;y    &gt;&gt;Shift x left/right by y bits   
     &amp;    Bitwise AND/set-intersection   
     ^    Bitwise NOT/set-symmetric-difference(XOR)   
     |    Bitwise OR/set-union   
      &gt;= == != is, is not, in, not in    Comparison object identity, membership  Chained   
     not    Logical negation   
     and    Logical and (short-circuit)   
     or    Logical not (short-circuit)   
     x if b else y    Conditional expression   
     lambda a : e    Un-named(anonymous) function generation   
     yield    Generator function send protocol   
  
      
  The rules for using these tables on expressions are
     O1: When an expression contains two consecutive operators, neither
            appearing in parentheses, Python applies the higher precedence
            operator first.
      O2: When an expression contains two consecutive operators, neither
            appearing in parentheses, and both have the same precedence,
            Python applies left associative operators left to right; it
            applies right associative operators right to left; it applies
            chained operators as one group.
      O3: Python always evaluates expressions in parentheses before it uses
            them as operands/arguments in other expressions (so we can use
            parentheses to override precedence, forcing the operators inside the
            parentheses to be evaluated before the operators outside the
            parentheses).
    
  Thus, in the expression  3*x+1  we start by circling all literals and
    (variable) names.
  Then we see two consecutive operators with no parentheses: the  * 
    operator has a higher precedence than the  +  operator, so it and its
    operands are circled first.
  Then the  +  operator and its operands are circled, completing the
    oval diagram. 
  Remember, higher precendence operaters are evaluated earlier, lower
    precedence operators are evaluated later.
   
  In the expression below  3*(x+1)  the subexpression  x+1  appears
    in parentheses.
  Again, we start by circling all literals and (variable) names.
  Then we see two consecutive operators, but this time the second one is in
    parentheses.
  By rule O3, we must handle all the operators inside the parentheses first
    (circling the  +  operator first) and then circling the  * 
    operator last, after its operand has been circled.
  This complete this oval diagram.
    
      
 In fact, the parentheses themselves are suggestive of two sides of an 
   oval; you can always draw ovals around parenthesized expressions: they
   can be used to represent the result computed by the last operator inside
   the parentheses.
  
           Examples  
 
  Note that in the expression  A &amp;nbsp / &amp;nbsp B*C  it looks like
     A  is being divided by the product  B*C , but both operators
    have the same precedence, and are left associative, and all the redundant
    white space is meaningless once we have tokenized the expression (which is
    exactly what Python does first).
  So, this expression is equivalent to  A/B*C)  (with the extra spaces
    removed) which is equivalent to  (A/B)*C  (because these operators are
    left associative) and not  A/(B*C) .
  If a formula has the product of  B  and  C  in the denominator,
    then according to the rules of operator precedence and associativity, we
    must use parentheses in the denominator to instruct Python to compute the
    denominator first.
  Some students, in an attempt to avoid parentheses, write this expression as
     A/B/C , which has the same value, but I think that this form is
    uglier and harder to understand than just putting in the parentheses.
   
  Next, let's examine how to write an oval diagram for a more complicated
    expression, which computes the volume of a sphere of radius  r .
      4/3*pi*r**3  
  Assume that we bind  r = 2  and  pi = 3.1416  (which simplifies
    the math).
  Notice how implicit coversion and operator prototypes ultimately compute a
     float  result from this mixture of  int  and  float  values
  (detailed below the oval diagram).
 
     

      &amp;nbsp  
 
Note that there is one  /  operator, two  *  operators, and one
   **  operator.
Because of the operator precedence and associativity rules, we do not need
  to use any parentheses to write this expression correctly.
These rules ensure (a) division occurs before the multiplication following it
  (these equal precedence operators are left associative) and (b) exponentiation
  occurs before the multiplication preceding it (exponentiation has higher
  precedence).
 
Also note that when two  int  values are divided the result is a
   float  (according to the prototype  / (int,int) -&gt; float )
  and in  r**3  the  3  is implicitly converted/promoted from an
   int  to a  float  (as required, to match the prototype
    ** (float,float) -&gt; float ).
We could have explictly written this subexpression as  r**3.  which would
  have required no conversion/promotion because  3.  is a  float 
  literal.
  
Next, let's examine the combination of relational, logical and arithmetic
  operators (and note how multiple adjacent relational operators use chained
    associatitivity).
This expression, resulting in the  bool  value  False  computes
  whether  x  is between  1  and  10  inclusive and  x 
  is strictly greater than twice  y .
  
     




      &amp;nbsp  
 
Note that all the relational operators (here  &lt;=  &amp;lt ) have
  a higher precedence than the logical operators (here  and )
That makes sense because relational operators produce  bool  results and
  logical operators use  bool  values as their operands; so the relational
  operators should have higher precedence.
Arithmetic operators even higher precedence.
 
Also note that because the two  &lt;=  operators are adjacent, and
  relational operators use chained associativity, we draw one large oval around
  this sequence/chain of operators and their operands.
So,  0 &lt;= x &lt;= 10  computes whether both  0  is less than or
  equal to  x  and  x  is less than or equal to  10 .
We could write this subexpression as the equivalent
   0 &lt;= x  and x &lt;= 10 .
We prefer the former way, using chained relational operators, because it is
  shorter and just as meaningful.
  
Here is one more expression to analyze: it actually is quite interesting in
  what it does and how it does it.
  
     




      &amp;nbsp  
 
Note that twice the expression computes a  bool  values and multiplies it
   times an  int  value.
To match the prototype ( * (int,int) -&gt; int ) of the  *  operator,
  Python implicity converts/promotes each  bool  to an  int  according
  to the rule:  False  promotes to  0  and  True  promotes to
    1 .
 
Try evaluating this expression with  x = 3  and  y = 5 ; the result
  is again  3 , but now the left product is  3  and the right product
  is  0 .
Choose different values to bind to  x  and  y  and evaluate this
  expression: you will find that it always is the smaller of these values; this
  expression computes the minimum of  x  and  y .
Here is a quick justification.
The two boolean subexpressions are  x and  x&gt;y ; these are
  opposite tests: when one is  True  the other is  False .
So one side of the sum will always be zero; the other side will be  x 
  or  y ; it will be  x  if  x evalutes to  True ;
  it will be  y  when  x&gt;y  evalutes to  True .
So, it will be  x  when  x  is the smaller number and it will be
   y  when  y  is the smaller number.
    
Finally, we could have made the conversion explicit by instead writing this
  expression as  int(xy)*y .
Because implicit conversion from  bool  to  int  is not familiar to
  most people, the explicit conversion version is probably better.
Of course, if we ever must analyze and expression to understand it better,
  these oval diagrams are exactly what you should use.
  
As another example, what would the previous expression mean in Python if 
   y  were bound to a  float  value instead?
Here is an example.
Notice implicit conversions from both  bool  to  float  and from
   int  to  float .
The result is a  float .
Suprisingly, even if we had written  x = 5.  and  y = 3  the result
 would have been  3.  (not  3 ) because of the conversions.
  
Finally, let's look at an example that involves a method call instead of a
  function call; this example is also interesting because it use the string
  ( str ) type, including string semantics for the  +  and  * 
  operators.
The following expression computes an all upper-case letter version of  s 
  and concatenates it with the  !  character repeated 3 times.
The result is the  str   FIRE!!! 
  
     




      &amp;nbsp  
 
Notice how the method call  upper  appears, and note that the  * 
  operator still has precedence over  +  whether we are using numeric or
  string operands.
 
           Expression Pragmatics  
 
  Write expressions correctly (for computers) and clearly (for people,
    including yourself).
  Use suggestive spacing, redundant parentheses, or both to clarify (for the
    person) the meanings of complicated expressions.
    Suggestive Spacing: use extra whitespace around lower-precedence
          operators to suggest that they are evaluated later.
        Recall that whitespace doesn't change the meaning of a program (all the
          tokens remain the same), but this spacing makes it easier for
          people to "see" operator precedence.
      Redundant Parentheses: use unneeded parentheses (they do not override
          the precedence of any operators) around higher-precedence operators
          to reinforce that they are evaluated earlier.
     
       Expression  Suggestive Spacing  Redundant () 
         .5*a*t**2+v*t+d   
       .5*a * t**2  +  v*t  +  d   
       .5*a*(t**2)+(v*t)+d   
      
  Also, use literals of the correct type to avoid implicit conversion (which
    often leads to harder-to-understand expression).
  If you want to indicate conversion, use explict conversion functions to make
    it explicit: doing so doesn't change how Python evaluates the expression
    (implicit/explicit conversion both do the same thing) but for anyone
    reading the code (including you), the expression will be easier to
    understand.
  We can check the expressions we write by analyzing them with oval diagrams,
    and evaluating them for a few different values to ensure that they compute
    the correct answers.
    
  Don't convert literals; when I see students write  float(5)  it pains me
    greatly: write just  5.  instead.
             Synthesis:Formulas -&gt; Expressions  
 
Now let's look at the problem of translating mathematical formulas (often
  written in a 2-dimensional notation) into  equivlalent Python expressions
  (written in a 1-dimensional notation).
The key to such a process will be to find the operator that will be applied
  last (after its operands/subexpressions are computed); then to write the
  operator and placeholders for its operands, and apply this process
  recursively to synthesize its subexpressions.
Let's apply this process to to translating the following formula into a Python
  expression: it computes one root of a quadratic equation.
                __________
             / 2
    -b  +  \/ b  - 4ac

  ---------------------------
               2a  

So, for the root of the quadratic equation, the division between the numerator
and the denominator is applied last, so we would start with

    numerator/denominator  

The denominator is just  2a , so we rewrite the formula as follows,
  putting the denominator in paretheses to avoid the common operator
  precedence mistake.
 
    numerator/(2*a)  

Now, the last operator applied in the  numerator  is the  + .
So we rewrite the formula as follows, putting the  numerator  in
  parentheses to force the  +  to be applied before the  / .
We use     (left + right) / (2*a)  
because	    left + right / (2*a)   would compute incorrectly: it
  would apply the  +  after division.
 
The  left  is just  -b , so we rewrite the formula as follows.
We don't need to put -b in parentheses, because the negative operator (-)
  has a precedence higher than  +  so it will be applied earlier.
We now have     (-b + right) / (2*a)  

The  right  requires using the  sqrt  function (assume
   from math import sqrt ), so we rewrite the formula as follows
    (-b + sqrt(body)) / (2*a)  
Inside the  body  the last operator applied is  - .
So we rerwite the formula as follows.
    (-b + sqrt(left - right)) / (2*a)  

The left formula is just  b**2 , so we rewrite the formula as follows.
We don't need to put  b**2  in parentheses, because the  **  operator
  has a higher precedence than  -  so it will be applied earlier.
    (-b + sqrt(b**2 - right)) / (2*a)  

The  right  formula performs two multiplications.
Since adjacent multiplications are done left to right, the left operand is
 4a  and the right is  c , so we can rewrite the formula as follows.
We don't need to put  left*c  in parentheses, because the * operator has
  a higher precedence than the  -  operator.
    (-b + sqrt(b**2 - left*c)) / (2*a)  

Finally, we can rewite left as just  4*a  and we are done converting the
mathematical formula into an Python expression.
    (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)  

Try to use an oval diagram to analyze this expression to see if we converted
  it correctly.
  
We can carefully apply this method to convert any mathematical formula into a
  Python expression, no matter how complicated it is, but we must also remember
  rules of operator precedence and associativity.
             Simple Functions  
 

Although this is getting a bit ahead of ourselves, we know enough now to
  define simple functions, using the  return  keyword.
Here is a definition of the  quadratic  function, which combines a
  function header (which we know about from reading/calling functions) with
  and expression (which we know about from this chapter) just the keyword
   return , which we will discuss exactly when we discuss functions in
  detail: for now, it just tells the function what value to return as a result.
    def quadratic(a,b,c,x):
      return a*x**2 + b*x + c  
With this knowledge you can abstract any compuatation that is an expression into
  a function you can define.
You can put such a definition in a script (for use once, in the current
  computation) or in a library module, so you can import the function and use
  it in any script.
This is just the tip of the iceberg about functions, we we will study in more
  detail after we discuss the control structures that often inside them.
            Final Topics  
 

We briefly touch on two topics here that we will learn much more about later
  (some in ICS-33).
First Python translate all the operators into calls on special methods defined
  in the classes that specify their left operand.
So, for example, in the  int  class there is a special method call
   __add__  that is called whenever an  int  object is the left
  operand of a  +  operator; this method determines the type of the
   right  operand to determine how to perform the addition: it produces
  an  int  result if the right operand is an  int , but produces a
   float  result if the right operand is a  float .
When we learn how to define our own classes, we can write methods like
   __add__  that the  +  operator will call.
 
There is a special function named  eval  that is defined in the
   builtins  module (whose names are automatically imported into every
  module).
It has a single  str  argument and returns some object: the result of
  treating that argument as if Python were to evaluate it as an expression.
Its prototype is  eval(str) -&gt; object .
For example, if we had a script
    a = 1
  b = 2
  print (eval('a+b'))  
Python would print  3 .
Big deal, we could have written  print(a+b)  inside the script.
But now let us look at another script.
    a = 1
  b = 2
print (eval(prompt.for_string('Enter expression using a and b'))))  
Now, the user is prompted and could enter any string, say  a+3*b  and
  Python would  eval  that string and print the answer  7 .
So, in the middle of running a script, Python can ask the user for some
  information (here an expression) and determine its value in the context of
  where the "code" was entered.
That is different than Python knowing what should be in the script before it
  starts running.
This is a powerful feature that we will use when we need the power.
What do you think we happen if we entered  a+c ?

Note that  eval("3")  is the  int  object with the value
     3  (just as  int("3")  would be;
   eval("True")  is the  bool  object with the value
      true ;
   eval("'abc'")  is the  str  object with the value
      'abc' ;
   eval('v')  is whatever object the name  v  is bound to
     (which might raise and exception if  v  is not a defined name:
      NameError: name 'v' is not defined .

       Evaluate the expression  (a+b - abs(a-b))//2  when
           a = 3  and  b = 5

       Suppose that we define  attendance = 3000  and
           capacity=10000  the number of fans attending an event at a
          stadium and the maximum number of fans possible at that
          stadium respectively.
        Which of the following expressions evaluates to 30, the percentage of
          fans in the stadium?
        What do the "incorrect" expressions evaluate to?
                  attendance//capacity
        100*attendance//capacity
        100*(attendance//capacity)
        attendance//capacity*100          

       Assume that we define  year  to be some  int  value.
         Write an expression whose result is  True  whenever  year 
           stores a leap year and  false  otherwise.
         We define a leap year as any year that is a perfect multiple of of
            4 , but not if it is a perfect multiple of  100 
           (unless it is also a perfect multiple of  400 ).
         Note that one number is a perfect multiple of another if the
           remainder after division equals zero.
      

        Assume that we define  x ,  y , and  z  to refer to
            int  values.
         Write an expression that computes whether...
           ... x  is odd
              ... x  is a multiple of 20 (e.g., 20, 40, 60, ...)
           
         Assume that zero is a positive number.
         Write an expression that computes whether...
           ... x  and  y  are both positive
              ... x  and  y  have the same sign
            (both are positive or both are negative)
              ... x  and  y  have different signs
            (one is positive and one is negative)
           
         Write an expression that computes whether...
           ...all three names ( x ,  y , and  z ) are bound
                to equal values
              ...all three names ( x ,  y , and  z ) are bound
                to different values (none the same)
              ...two variables store the same value, but the third one is
                different
            

        Assume that we specify two points in space by definint the x and y
           coordinate of each using
            x1 ,  y1 ,  x2 , and  y2  all which are
            float .
         Write an expression that computes...
           ...the distance between these points
              ...the slope of the line from the first point to the second
              ...whether both points lie on the same line from the origin
              ...whether the first point is above the second
              ...what quadrant the first point lies in (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)
              ...whether the two points lie in the same quadrant
            

        Assume that we specify a circle with the definitions
            centerX ,  centerY , and  radius 
           and a point by the defintions  x  , y  all which are
            float .
         Write an expression that computes whether or not the point lies inside
            the circle (include points on the boundary).
      

        Assume that specify an interval by a pair of  int  values (the
           ones at the beginning and end of the interval:  5  and  8 
           would specify the interval containing the numbers  5 ,
            6 ,  7 , and  8  inclusive.
         We declare  b1 ,  e1 ,  b2 , adn  e2  to
           represent the beginning and end of two intervals (all  int ),
           and  x  so represent some  int  value.
         Note that we will guarantee that the intervals are "well formed":
            b1  and   b2 .
           Write an expression that computes the number of values in an 
                  interval beginning with  b1  and ending with  e1 .
              Write an expression that computes whether...
                 ... x  is inside the first interval
                   ... x  is not inside the first interval
                   ... x  is inside the first interval but not the second
                   ... x  is inside either the first or second interval (or both)
                   ... x  is inside either the first or second interval (but not both)
                   Write an expression that computes whether...
                 ...the first interval is the same as the second
                   ...the first interval ends before the second one begins
                   ...the first interval ends on the same value as the second one begins
                   ...the first interval is inside the second one
                   ...the first interval and the second interval overlap (at least one common value)
                   ...the first interval and the second interval do not overlap (no common values)
                   
         Draw pictures to help you visualize the relationships; choose your relational and logical
           operators carefully, and try a few examples to convince yourself that your expressions are
           correct.
         For example, the following picture shows the first interval inside the second.     

        Assume that we define  x ,  y , and  z  to refer to
            int  values.
         Write an expression that computes the minimum of these three values.
         You may use the  min  function; its prototype is
            min(int,int) -&gt; int  and it computes/returns the minimum of its
           arguments.
      

        Assume that we defined
          low ,  high ,and  x  to be  int  and that we
         guarantee that  low .
         Write an expression whose result is  low  if  x  is smaller
          than  low ,   high  if  x  is greater than
           high , and  x  if it is between these values.
          You may use the  min  and the  max  functions (see the
          problem above).
