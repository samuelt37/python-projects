12.6 Identifying Ring Systems 
 

 
The OEChem function OEDetermineRingSystems behaves very similarly to
the OEDetermineComponents function described in the previous section.
However, this function returns a mapping from atom indices to a ring
system index denoting a ring system, or "component" connected only by
ring bonds.  This function requires that OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds has
called previously.  All acyclic atoms are mapped to the value zero.
