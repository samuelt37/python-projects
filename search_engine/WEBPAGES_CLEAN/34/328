   Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity .

It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

    New algorithms for minimum area  k -gons .

Shows that the minimum area polygon containing  k  of  n 
points must be near a line determined by two points,
and uses this observation to find the polygon quickly.

polytopes " in the journal version.

    Separating geometric thickness from book thickness . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0109195 .
 
We show that  geometric thickness 
and book thickness are not
asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
geometric thickness two and book thickness  &gt;   t .

We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments
similar to those in
" Separating book thickness from thickness ".
