 Sample Modules 
 
  ICS-33: Intermediate Programming  
  

  
The following is a list of zipped Eclipse project files (more might be added
  during the quarter).
Please feel free to download, unzip, run, and study these scripts (both their
  code and their run-time behavior).
Programmers gain tremendous insight into all facets of programming by studying
  the code of other programmers (especially those with more experience; and I
  am happy to improve my code based on your observations -nothing is perfect).
A good programmer typically makes elegant use of the required language
  features, resulting in smaller, more elegant code.
  
All downloadable projects are listed alphabetically; you can also search this
  page for keywords.
All are zip files, so unzip them first.
Most project files require the
  Download:  standard course library 
  which contains a variety of useful modules.
If you followed the Eclipse installation instructions, you should have already
  created the  courselib  folder in your workspace and populated it with
  these modules.
  

   


Download:  Backtracking Search  
This project contains a general solver for all backtracking search problems:
  problems are solved by binding aspects to values, generating every possible
  possibilities and determining which are solutions; one function finds a/one
  solution, another finds all solutions.
It also contains three files that define the Problem/Aspect classes needed by
  the solver and scripts to solve actual problems via backtracking search.
   Solving the N Queens problem: Can N queens be placed on an NxN
      chessboard so no queen can attack (horizontally, vertically or on a
      diagonal) any other queen.
    Here is a sample solution of the 4 Queens problem.

   Solving Sudoku puzzles: Can a 9x9 square (read from a file) have its empty
       entries filled so that every row and column contains the numbers all the
       numbers 1-9, and 3x3 squares comprising the 9x9 cube likewise each
       contain all the numbers 1-9.
    Here is a sample problem (on the left) and solution (on the right).
     9 6   | 1   4 |   5                      9 6 3 | 1 7 4 | 2 5 8
       8 | 3     | 6                        1 7 8 | 3 2 5 | 6 4 9

   Solving Anagrams: For any input of words, find all sequences of words (of a
      certain or arbitrary length, each rom some dictionary of legal words)
      that contain  exactly those characters (including repetitions).
    For example, the word  California  has an anagram  racial info .
   

Download:  Collatz Conjecture  
The Collatz conjecture states: starting with any positive number, repeat the
  process "If it is even, halve it; if it is odd, multiply it by three and
  add one" and eventually the remaining value reduces to one.
No one has been able to prove this conjecture, but a short script allows us
  to investigate it (and others have examined billions of different values
  and found no counterexamples).
It is interesting to observe the number of cycles required to reduce the
  starting number to 1, looking for a pattern.
This script is highlighted in the
   debugger handout .
  

Download:  
  Craps Statistics  
This script prompts the user for the number of craps games to play (craps
  is a dice game whose rules are explained in the block comment at the top
  of this script).
It then simulates that many games of craps, printing the number (and percentage)
  of wins, losses, dice throws (and average dice throws per game), elapsed
  time, and game playing speed.
This script is used inthe problem set for the
   debugger handout .
  

Download:  
  Regular Expression Tester  
This script is a complicated driver for testing methods in the  re 
  (Regular Expression) module.
There are boths simple and complex features dealing with entering patterns
  and testing for matches, searches, finds, substitutes (with replacements),
  and splits.
Regular Expressions are tersely illustrated in a
   lecture .
  

Download:  State-Space Search  
This project contains a general solver for all state-space search problems:
  problems are solved by generating sequences of operators to transform the
  start state of a problem into its stop state; one function finds the optimal
  (minimum operators) solution by breadth-first searching, another tries to
  minizmize the number of states explored but cannot be guaranteed to find the
  optimal solution (unless its heuristic satisifes the A* property).
It also contains a files that define the Problem/Operators/State classes
  and a script needed by the solver to the water-jugs problem.
  

Download:  
  Translate Student ID -&gt; Unique/Spreadsheet ID  
This script translates a UCI student's ID (must be an integer) into
  the ID appearing on the grading spreadsheet for that student.
