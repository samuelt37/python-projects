   Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0307023 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

We describe an efficient streaming-model construction of epsilon-nets
and epsilon-approximations, and use it to find deterministic streaming-model
approximation algorithms for iceberg range queries and for various
robust statistics problems.

    All maximal independent sets and dynamic dominance for sparse
graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0407036 .  16th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Vancouver, 2005, pp. 451–459.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(4):A38, 2009 .
 
We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets
in bounded-degree graphs in constant time per set, in graphs from minor
closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

    Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0604034 .  18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(3): Article 29, 2009 .
 
We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.
