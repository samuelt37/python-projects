  CGAL::Triangulation_2&lt;Traits,Tds&gt;::Locate_type  
 

  Definition 
 

The  enum    Triangulation_2&lt;Traits,Tds&gt;::Locate_type   is defined by the
  Triangulation_2 &lt;Traits,Tds&gt;  
class to specify
which case occurs when locating a point in the triangulation.
  

    
           
  
    
     enum   Locate_type  {    
     VERTEX =0  
,  EDGE   
,  FACET   
,  OUTSIDE_CONVEX_HULL   
,  OUTSIDE_AFFINE_HULL   
};    
              
    The locate type is :   VERTEX   when the located point coincides 
with a vertex of the triangulation   EDGE   when the point is in the relative interior of an edge   FACE   when the point is in the interior of a facet   OUTSIDE_CONVEX_HULL   when the point
is  outside the convex hull but in the affine hull of the current triangulation   OUTSIDE_AFFINE_HULL   
when the point is outside the affine hull
of the current triangulation.
