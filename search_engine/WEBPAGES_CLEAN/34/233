 Number-Theoretic Hacks 

  I have implemented a number of simple number-theoretic
algorithms 
for my own amusement, and provide them here on the net.  

     Egyptian Fractions -- algorithms and
references.   

 This notebook for Mathematica 2.2/Macintosh (also available in
HTML format) describes and implements a number of different
algorithms for representing rational numbers as sums of distinct
unit fractions. 
 
  

  

     C++ implementation of J.H.Conway's
"nimber" arithmetic.   

 Conway's nimbers (used in  
combinatorial game theory ) form an infinite field of
characteristic two, with a natural binary representation in which
truncation to a fixed number of bits produces finite subfields
GF[2^2^k]. The algorithms in this file implement nimber
multiplication, square root, and other functions, using O(k 3^k)
bit operations. This bound is somewhat worse than what one can
achieve for the more standard irreducible polynomial representation
of GF[2^2^k] but is simpler and more uniform. 
This version is an update to my code by Achim Flammenkamp,
to make it run under less archaic versions of C++ and allow
numbers with more bits than machine precision;
the original code is  here .
 
  

  

     C++ fast algorithm for computing 2-adic
inverse.   

 The p-adic numbers, much beloved of a certain net.crackpot, can
be thought of as describing arithmetic modulo powers of p^k, in the
limit as k becomes large. The 2-adic inverse of some odd integer x
is then another integer y such that xy=1 mod 2^k. (Actually y is
only well-defined mod 2^k rather than as an integer itself.) The
algorithm in this file defines a fast method for finding such
inverses (mod 2^32) found by analogy to a standard method for
floating point inversion. 
 
  

  

     C program for rational approximation of
real numbers.   

 This program finds the most accurate possible approximations of
a given input value by rationals x/y such that y is within a given
bound. Two approximations are returned, one on each side of the
input. The method is to truncate the continued fraction
representation of the input, and then slightly modify the last term
of the truncated representation. 
 
  

  

     Interference pattern.   

 The value of each pixel (x,y) of this image (used as the
background for this page) was formed by testing whether (x^2+y^2)
mod q is greater than or less than q/2 for some large value of q.
If one interprets (x,y) as the complex number (Gaussian integer)
x+iy, the form (x^2+y^2) is its norm, and we can form similar
pictures by using norms of other rings. For instance, the norm of
the Eisenstein integers produces a similar pattern of concentric
circles in a triangular grid. See also Eric Weisstein's entry on the
 Circles
and Squares Fractal , and  Helmut
Dersch's image interpolation quality comparison  using an image like this
for the tests.
