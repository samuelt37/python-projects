            Quiz</strong>  1:</strong>  
           1. This quiz is due at midnight late Sunday night/ early Monday morning. 
           2. You have 240 minutes to complete it.  Once the timer starts, you can't stop it. 
           3. There are 41 short answer questions. There is a crossword which will help provide some clues for the answers. 
           4. It covers Lectures 1-5, the readings assigned for those days. It does not cover any "Shaping Things" or XML. 
           5. You can take it electronically on EEE. 
           6. I recommend that you study before you start your timer.  
           7. You may use your textbook and the Internet to answer questions.  
           8. You may not discuss your answers with any other person who has already started their timer. If you do that it is cheating.
