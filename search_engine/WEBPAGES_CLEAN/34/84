   PURPOSE     
  Junction Tree Inference for a rectangular grid Boltzmann m/c</strong> 

   SYNOPSIS     
  function sNodes = runJTgrid( model ) </strong> 

   DESCRIPTION     
   Junction Tree Inference for a rectangular grid Boltzmann m/c

 Function that take a rectangular grid Boltzmann m/c (with 0/1 outputs) and 
 runs a node clustering version of the general Junction Tree algorithm. 
 Returns the node clusters and their final potentials (the marginals).

 Inputs:
         model: struct with fields
                numRows: # rows, R, in the grid
                numCols: # columns, C, in the grid
                alpha  : (R X C) matrix of node biases
                wHor   : (R X C-1) matrix of horizontal edge weights 
                wVer   : (R-1 X C) matrix of vertical edge weights 

 Returns:
         sNodes: struct with fields
                 nodes: matrix where row i gives the nodes belonging to supernode i. 
                        Size is ( number of supernodes X (R+1) )
                 pot  : matrix where row i gives the marginal of supernode i.  
                        Size is ( number of supernodes X (2^(R+1))
