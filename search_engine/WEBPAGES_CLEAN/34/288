            Christmas Tunes!    
        
           
               I've stumbled across some great free Christmas music lately.   On this site , one can find a terrific rendition of "Hark The Herald" from Straight No Chaser (an a capella group from Indiana University), a unique version of "Joy To The World" by Tonic Sol-fa, "Angels We Have Heard On High" by Sixpence, and a modern take on "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" from Jars of Clay.   Amazon  is also giving away free music this month, from the likes of Mannheim Steamroller to Vince Guaraldi.  And if you want to hear some of my fiddling on an acoustic guitar,  click   here .
