	     About Me 
       I am a big fan of  Artificial Intelligence . I believe that one day robots will help the human in all our daily lives. 
	     I am currently a research scientist at  Institute of Deep Learning ,  Baidu Research , working with Baidu Distinguished Scientist  Wei Xu  on Robot Learning. Previously, I worked with many talented people including  Jiang Wang ,  Chang
        Huang ,  Kai Yu , et. al. on  Deep Learning ,  Computer Vision  and  Natural Language Understanding . 
	     I obtained my Ph.D. degree in  Computer Science  at  UC Irvine  in 2013. I was a member of the  Computational Vision Group  where I was advised by  Prof. Deva Ramanan  and  Prof. Charless Fowlkes . 
       I had summer internships at  Google  and  Microsoft Research . At Google, I worked with  Emilio Antunez  and  Tianli Yu  on  Visual Clothing Search . At Microsoft Research, I worked with  Simon Baker  and  Anitha Kannan  on  Proxemics Recognition .  
       I completed a master degree in  Industrial Engineering  at  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  with  Prof. L. Jeff Hong , and a bachelor degree in  Automation  at  Tsinghua University .
