 Abstract 
 

 
Nowadays, searches for webpages of a person with a given name constitute a notable fraction of queries to web search engines. Such a query would normally return webpages related to several namesakes, who happened to have the queried name, leaving the burden of disambiguating and collecting pages relevant to a particular person (from among the namesakes) on the user. In this article we develop a Web People Search approach that clusters webpages based on their association to different people. Our method exploits a variety of semantic information extracted from Web pages, such as named entities and hyperlinks, to disambiguate among namesakes referred to on the Web pages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing the efficacy of the disambiguation algorithms and its impact on person search.
