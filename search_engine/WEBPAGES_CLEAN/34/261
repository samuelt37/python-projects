 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Jimage CLASSPATH setup for Unix<body>
 

 Setting CLASSPATH in Unix to include jimage 

  
This section will explain how to set the CLASSPATH environment variable
to include jimage.
 

 
Note: The example below uses the tcsh shell.
 

 displaying the CLASSPATH 

 
To display your current CLASSPATH type the command echo $CLASSPATH.  This
command asks your shell to display the string associated with the
CLASSPATH environment variable. (This command is available on the csh
and tcsh.)
 

   

 
Note: The CLASSPATH has the paths of the swing 0.7 files.
 

 Setting the CLASSPATH to jimage 

  There are a number of different means you can use to alter your environment 
variable in Unix.  
You may use any technique which will append the path to jimage to
your CLASSPATH.  The following is one way you could change your CLASSPATH.
 

  You should have jimage somewhere you have access to it.
In the screenshot below, the jimage is in the directory /home/yuzok/classes.
 

   

  You can use the setenv command in the following way when you
want to append to the CLASSPATH value. The command will look like this:
  setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH':/home/yuzok/classes' 
 
Note: For tcsh, the two ' are needed because : is interpreted by the shell.
The ' quotes all the characters between then so tcsh won't interpret the :.
The meaning of the command is -- set CLASSPATH to the previous 
value of CLASSPATH plus all
the characters from the first ' to the last '.
The screenshot below displays the appending using setenv and the resulting 
environment variable displayed by the echo command.
 

   

  Note: You have appended CLASSPATH with the path the directory
above the jimage directory.
The Java interpretor will look for the .class files for jimage under 
the jimage directory.  
 

  You now have the jimage in the CLASSPATH.
