Does anybody know how to show that for any set of n points in the plane,
the number of triples that determine an isosceles triangle is O(n^(7/3))?

I would appreciate any suggestions and references.  
Thank you.  Have a nice day!!

Here's one reference:

J. Pach and P. K. Agarwal, "Combinatorial Geometry", Wiley,
1995, theorem 12.2, page 184.

The proof is omitted but should be obvious from the surrounding context.

Can you please try to clarify my perplexity over this question?

Obviously, most sets of n points in the plane will have no repeated
distances.  None.  So:  Whence the isosceles triangles?

(I am sure this question must have a very obvious answer, but I don't see it.)

Thanks,

Dan Asimov

Obviously, the problem asks about worst case bounds that are true for
all arrangements of points, rather than just a measure-1 subset of the
arrangements.

For instance, if you happen to choose points that form a sqrt(n)*sqrt(n)
integer grid, there will be many isosceles triangles.  (More than n^2 of
them, but fewer than n^(7/3).)

Thanks -- I guess your "obviously" is not necessarily the same
as my "obviously"...
