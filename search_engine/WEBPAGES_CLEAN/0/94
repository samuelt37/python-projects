 Xiangxin Zhu  
  (Xiangxin is pronounced "Shung-Shin", and
Zhu is pronounced "Ju")  

  I graduated from UCI and joined   in September 2014.  

 I am a computer science Ph.D. student at  UC Irvine . I work at  School of Information and Computer Sciences  with the  Computational Vision Group  where I am advised by  Professor Deva Ramanan  and  Professor Max Welling . I am broadly interested in computer vision, machine learning and their applications.

  Previously, I completed my M.E. in  Institute of Automation ,  Chinese Academy of Sciences  with  Professor Stan Li , and B.S. in
 Tsinghua
University , Beijing, China. I was at  Google Visual Search  for the summer of
2012 working with  Drago Anguelov .
