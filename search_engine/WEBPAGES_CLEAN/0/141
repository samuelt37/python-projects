       Net neutrality  represents the idea that Internet users are entitled to broadband Internet service that does not discriminate on the basis of source, destination, or ownership of Internet traffic. This idea has formed the basis for vigorous public policy debates over governmental regulation of the Internet or Internet access. Both the United States Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have been actively involved. 
       In 2006, while I was serving as a Congressional Fellow, the  United States Congress considered  legislation on net neutrality , which generated considerable  public interest and debate . This experience, combined with our previous research on  Network QoS , on  Dynamic Resource Allocation for Wireless Multimedia , and on  Pricing of Internet Resources , motivated me to conduct research on the topic. 
         
        Our Research on Net Neutrality</strong> 
       We argue that neither the extreme pro nor con net neutrality positions are consistent with the philosophy of Internet architecture. Our view is that the net neutrality issue is the result of a fragmented communications policy unable to deal with technology convergence. We develop a net neutrality policy based on the layered structure of the Internet that gracefully accommodates convergence. Our framework distinguishes between discrimination in high barrier-to-entry network infrastructure and in low barrier-to-entry applications. The policy prohibits use of Internet infrastructure to produce an uneven playing field in Internet applications. In this manner, the policy restricts an Internet service provider's ability to discriminate in a manner that extracts oligopoly rents, while simultaneously ensuring that ISPs can use desirable forms of network management. We illustrate how this net neutrality policy can draw upon current communications law through draft statute language. We believe this approach is well grounded in both technology and policy, and that it illustrates a middle ground that may even be somewhat agreeable to the opposing forces on this issue. 
       Our proposed  layered approach to defining nondiscrimination rules that removes the need to define either “managed services” or what constitutes the “Internet portion” of a provider's offerings. We propose that any QoS mechanisms that an ISP implements in network infrastructure layers should be available to application providers without unreasonable discrimination. Requiring such an open interface can ensure that ISPs are prohibited from refusing to provide enabling Internet infrastructure services to competing application providers in order to differentiate the ISP's own application offerings, prohibited from providing Internet infrastructure services to competing application providers at inflated prices in order to favor the ISP's own application offerings, and prohibited from making exclusive deals to provide enabling Internet infrastructure services to certain application providers. It can also ensure that ISPs have the right to apply network management mechanisms that do not threaten a level playing field, and to make arrangements with consumers, application providers, and peering ISPs for Internet infrastructure services in a manner that does not conflict with the above goals.  
       This type of layered approach, requiring an open interface, is a more streamlined and more effective solution that carving out a set of managed services. There is no need to define what constitutes the “Internet portion” of a provider's offerings. There is also no need to define what constitutes “managed services”, as the open interface requires access to lower layer QoS mechanisms that enables real-time applications, rather than carving out real-time applications as an exception. The open interface thus encourages competition in managed services, rather than inhibiting such competition.

        Our Research on Reasonable Traffic Management</strong> 
       As part of the wider debate over net neutrality, traffic management practices of Internet Service Providers have become an issue of public concern. The Federal Communications Commission has asked for public input on whether deep packet inspection and other traffic management practices are reasonable forms of network management. Little attention has been paid to this issue within the academic networking community, and most Internet policy researchers have recommended a case-by-case analysis.  
       In contrast, in these papers we propose a framework for the classification of traffic management practices as reasonable or unreasonable. To build the framework, we focus both on the technical aspects of traffic management techniques and on the goals and practices of an ISP that uses these techniques. The framework classifies traffic management practices as reasonable or unreasonable on the basis of the technique used and on the basis of how and when the techniques are applied. We suggest that whether a traffic management practice is reasonable largely rests on the answers to four questions regarding the techniques and practices used. We consider examples of how these techniques are used by ISPs, and how the answers to these four questions collectively affeect the degree to which a traffic management practice is reasonable. Based on these questions, we propose a framework that classifies techniques as unreasonable if they are unreasonably anti-competitive, cause undue harm to consumers, or unreasonably impair free speech. 
       We propose that traffic management practices are reasonable if they are implemented at endpoints, are chosen by the user, are based on reasonable application provider payment, or involve providing QoS to traffic chosen by the user. We propose that traffic management practices implemented in transit nodes without user choice are unreasonable if they block applications, assign QoS based on source, destination or service provider, or assign QoS based on unreasonable application provider payment. We suggest that QoS based on the application can be more effectively implemented by allowing the user to determine the priority of his/her applications, and we suggest that any charges for QoS can be most effectively implemented by integrating them into subscriber contracts and into the Service Level Agreements between ISPs, rather than by charging application providers that are not subscribers.

        Our Research on Wireless Net Neutrality</strong> 
       We analyze the technical differences between wired and wireless networks, and conclude that net neutrality, if properly defined, should apply to both networks. We furthermore conclude that wireless broadband access providers can effectively implement reasonable traffic management by controlling the amount of QoS of traffic, rather than by directly controlling what applications are used. We address whether differences between wired and wireless network technology merit different treatment with respect to net neutrality. 
       We are concerned with whether the challenges of wireless signals and mobility merit different traffic management techniques, and how these techniques may affect net neutrality. Although wireless networks require stronger traffic management, we find these differences are only at and below the network layer, and hence wireless broadband access providers can effectively control congestion without restricting a user’s right to run the applications of their choice. 
       We are also concerned with which wireless applications or services should be covered by a net neutrality requirement, and whether this requires the definition of managed services. We argue that since the differences between wired and wireless networks lie in lower layers, net neutrality in both wired and wireless networks can be effectively accomplished by requiring an open interface between network and transport layers. We argue that this is a more streamlined and more effective solution that carving out a set of managed services.

        Our Advice to the FCC</strong> 
       In 2009, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed   net neutrality rules .  As part of that proposal, it created a Technical Advisory Process to advise the FCC on technological aspects of the proposal. My presentation as part of the kick-off of that process is here: 
       
           Open Internet Technical Advisory Process Workshop on Broadband Network Management, December 8, 2009 </strong> 
       
       Anytime the FCC proposes regulations, it seeks public input on a wide variety of relevant questions. Here was our advice:

        Subsequent FCC Actions</strong> 
       In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enacted the  2010 Open Internet Order , which included  rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking traffic, and from using unreasonable discriminatory network practices . 
       In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals  vacated a part of this Order , which again generated considered  public interest and debate . 
       In response, the FCC    proposed a new set of regulations, which again generated considered  public interest and debate . 
       In 2015, the FCC passed the  2015 Open Internet Order , which includes rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking traffic, from throttling traffic on the basis of content or application, from charging for prioritization of traffic from a third party, and from unreasonably interfering or disadvantaging a consumer's ability to use their broadband Internet service.  I am honored to have been able to contribute toward the writing of the FCC's Order, as well as toward preparing the FCC for its successful defense of the Order in Court, in my role as the FCC's Chief Technologist during this time.
