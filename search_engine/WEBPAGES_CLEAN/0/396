 Thunderbird Setup 

 
 

  This tutorial is based on Thunderbird 24.1.0. If you're using a different version, the naming convention may differ, but the settings will remain the same. 
 
  Start up Thunderbird for the first time (or go to Tools, Account Settings, Account Actions, Add Mail Account) 
 In the  Mail Account Setup  window, enter your name and email address. Enter your password here if you want to have it remembered. Click  Continue</strong>. 
 Thunderbird will now attempt to look for the IMAP information. Please make sure that you have  IMAP </strong>selected. 
 Click on  Manual config  in the lower left corner to make sure that the information is as follow:
  Incoming
  IMAP 
 Server hostname:  imap.ics.uci.edu</strong> 
 Port:  993</strong> 
 SSL:  SSL/TLS</strong> 
 Authentication:  Normal password</strong> 
  
 Outgoing
   UCI SMTP . If you're connecting from a laptop or from off campus, please use the UCI SMTP server settings or your ISP server settings.    For UCI SMTP, see settings from step number 7 in the link provided. 
  
 ICS SMTP. If your machine is in on the UCI-ICS domain, please use the following settings. 
  
 
 Server hostname:  smtp.ics.uci.edu</strong> 
 Port:  587</strong> 
 SSL:  STARTTLS</strong> 
 Authentication:  Normal password</strong> 
 Username:  &lt;your username&gt;</strong>
   
  
  
    
 Click  Re-test</strong> and then  Done</strong> 
 If you  did not  choose to have your password saved, you will now be prompted to enter your email password. 
 Go to  Tools </strong>and select  Account Settings</strong> 
 Under  Server Settings</strong>, click on the  Advanced  button
  Make sure that  IMAP server directory  is empty 
 Uncheck  Show only subscribed folders  
 Uncheck  Allow server to override these namespaces  
    
 This last step is optional. If you have many email messages, you may want to disable Message Synchronizing so that your email loads more quickly.
  While still on  Account Settings</strong> window, select  Synchronization &amp; Storage</strong> 
 Uncheck  Keep messages for this account on this computer</strong>
