 Semantic Retention in AMRM machines<body>

  Semantic Retention in AMRM machines  
      Semantic retention techniques will be used to:
 
  Carry out footprint memory analysis.
  Direct cache configuration (e.g., Block size).
  Cache-line configuration. 
  Better mapping of data to memory 
  E.g., Mapping irregular structures for efficient access based on application access pattern - e.g., store tree nodes in DF order.
    Better mapping through improved parallelism/code-reordering/prefetching.
