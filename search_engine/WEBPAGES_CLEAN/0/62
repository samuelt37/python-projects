In the field of gaming, it is believed that the number of male players overshadow the number of female players. However, such an ideology has proven to be false as the population of male and female players are, in fact, quite balanced. Thus, the question is raised - if the numbers are equal, why do women continue to be excluded from competitive spaces and how do we increase the involvement of women in the video game industry?                      Women in Gaming at UCI   Held at UCI on February 2, the Women in Gaming Panel discussed the influence of the representation of women in gaming and the concept of inclusive gaming.    esports.uci.edu                                                                        Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Sciences at UC Irvine           Â·       æ¨å¤© 09:20       Â·                We are so excited to welcome Naomi Kaplan-Damari to our weekly Statistics Seminar Series this week!
