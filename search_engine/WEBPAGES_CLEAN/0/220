We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.
