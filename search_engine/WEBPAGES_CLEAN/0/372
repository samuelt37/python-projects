 Approximate Inference Algorithms for Hybrid Bayesian Networks with
Discrete Constraints 

 Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
In this paper, we consider Hybrid Mixed Networks
(HMN) which are Hybrid Bayesian Networks
that allow discrete deterministic information
to be modeled explicitly in the form of constraints.
We present two approximate inference
algorithms for HMNs that integrate and adjust
well known algorithmic principles such as Generalized
Belief Propagation, Rao-Blackwellised
Importance Sampling and Constraint Propagation
to address the complexity of modeling and
reasoning in HMNs. We demonstrate the performance
of our approximate inference algorithms
on randomly generated HMNs.
