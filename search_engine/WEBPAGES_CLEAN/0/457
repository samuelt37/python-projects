                                 WICS kicked off the 2016 Spring Quarter on Monday the 28 th  with pizza and some general announcements for the quarter. Co-presidents Angela Liu and Stephanie Eng announced the recently elected new board members for next year. The new T-shirt design was also presented along with some of the future events the club is planning on hosting. There were approximately 40 WICS members in attendance at this meeting and many of them won some cool swag that the club raffled off. We hope to see these faces and more at our future events. Stay tuned for what’s coming up in WICS during this quarter!
