  December 4, 1998: 
On Uniquely 3-colorable Graphs II [*] 
presented by David Goggin, ICS, UC Irvine 
 
In [**], for each non-negative integer  k ,
we constructed a connected graph with
(24)2  k   vertices which is uniquely 3-colorable,
regular with degree  k +5, and triangle-free.
Here, for each positive integer  n 
and each integer  r  &gt; 5,
we construct a connected graph
with (26) n *2 ( r -5)  vertices
which is uniquely 3-colorable, regular with degree  r ,
and triangle-free.
