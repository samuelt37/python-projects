bool OEPerceiveChiral(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
This function determines the stereocenters of a molecule.  This
function uses symmetry classes of a molecule, to determine which atoms
and bonds are chiral.  This function updates the ``chiral'' Boolean
property of atoms and bonds.  As a side-effect it also sets the
``symclass'' property of all the atoms the molecule to be their
``explicit hydrogen suppressed'' symmetry class, by calling the OEChem
function  OEPerceiveSymmetry(mol,false) .
