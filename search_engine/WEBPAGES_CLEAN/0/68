  Here  is a memory module with test program for lab 6.
To use it, replace your mem.vhd with this mem file. You also need to change
RAM_ADDR in Global_dcls.vhd from range 0 to 31 to range 0 to 63 because the
memory is bigger now. After running the simulation for about 240000ns, your
memory content from address 31 to 63 should look like  this .

 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 

 For each lab assignment, you are required to submit your work in THREE
steps.    

   1.         submit
the specification ("paper design") to EEE. This may be a truth table,
FSM diagram, schematics, etc., as necessary to specify each lab assignment. You
can turn in scanned image of your paper, or electronic documents (excel
spreadsheets, Visio diagrams, etc).  

       

   2.         submit
the vhdl files, both the design and the test bench, to EEE (zipped into a
single file).   

   3.         demo
to the TA what you have submitted (there will be demo sign up sheets). Demo
must be done within one week after project deadline. 

     

       

   Submission format for EEE   :
    

   name a file with
     your student id    
   when submitting
     multiple files create a single zip file first.    
   Upload your
     (zip) file into your EEE lab folder.    
        

  Make sure to submit all required files
- otherwise we will not be able to grade your assignment       

     

 GRADING 

 Your final grade for the course CS 154 will depend on class participation
(attendance of class and lab) and lab assignment grades. A lab will have a
score of    100pts. Each lab will
have a different weight in the final grade computation based on its complexity.
 

     

  Lab scoring    

   Specification
     20%    
    Clearly specify  your  design, you may  use  truth table, logic
      function, and/or block diagram s  in your specification.      
         
    VHDL design -
     40%    
    Make sure what you submit is the final working code.    
    Test bench - 20% 
     Make sure to have enough test cases to cover different situations.     
    Comments - 5%    
   Demo        
      - 15%    
   The demo is required.  You will lose 50% of
your total lab score if you don't demo your work.      

     

  Late Submission     

 The later labs depend on earlier ones, so the deadlines of each lab will be
strictly enforced. If you are not able to finish a lab, submit the latest
version you have BEFORE the deadline, and you will be given partial credit.
