We do not know when some of our older shows were broadcast.  
These shows are:   

    Guest   Topic   Live?       Hank Becker   Educational Technology &amp; Computer Use in Schools   Pre-recorded      Marc Smith   Virtual Communities   Live      Margaret Elliot   Searching for Polly Klaas on the Internet   Live      Lisa Covi   Alpha Phi Omega on the Internet   Live      Mark Bernstein   Literary Hypertext   Live      

We started broadcasting the Cyberspace Report in late September of 1993,
but in our first shows we discussed issues amongst ourselves,
and did not have guests.  In January of 1994 we changed 
to our current guest-oriented format, and liked it.  Over 60 guests later,
we're still finding interesting guests, and new social issues to
explore in Cyberspace.   </body>
