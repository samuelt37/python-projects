 Abstract  
We propose a propositional language for temporal reasoning that is computationally 
effective yet expressive enough to describe information about fluents, events and temporal
constraints. Although the complete inference algorithm is exponential, we characterize a
tractable core with limited expressibility and inferential power. Our results render a variety
of constraint propagation techniques applicable for reasoning with constraints on fluents.
