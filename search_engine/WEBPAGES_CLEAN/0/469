 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Making an Anchor on the Subweb<body>
 

 Making an Anchor on the Subweb 

   
You can utilize the inherited Anchors and Links on the new subweb.  To
demonstrate, we will add a new anchored image to the inherited link.
 

 Making an Anchor on a new Image 

 
Download the image yeager_star.jpeg from the following site:
   Chimera 2.0 Turorial Download page 
 
Place it anywhere you like.
 

 
Display the image using Jimage.
 

   


 
Make an anchor on the image and add it to the Active Link (x1).
 

   

 Demonstrating that the inherited Anchors Exist 

  Now do a link traversal on the anchor in yeager_star.jpeg by 
clicking inside the anchor area using the left mouse button. The 
two other images of the X-1 will appear with their anchors flashing.
 


   

  Note: This partial screen-shot shows the link traversal caught at the
moment when both X-1 images are brought up with their anchors flashing.
