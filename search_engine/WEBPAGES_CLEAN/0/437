 Scientific Inference Systems Laboratory 

     

 The purpose of the Scientific Inference Systems Laboratory
(SISL) is to develop and apply computing technologies to assist scientists in
all phases of the scientific process [1] in biology, planetary science and
other sciences. �  Some relevant
technologies include biological modeling and knowledge representation software,
biological and geological modeling frameworks, and mathematical methods for
probabilistic modeling, nonlinear optimization, and network inference. �  SISL is an element of the  Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics 
and of the  Department of Information and
Computer Science  at the  University of
California Irvine .

 Systems Biology Research Area 

     

 The expression �systems biology� is often used to denote
attempts to build a computable, predictive scientific understanding of living
systems from an approximate understanding of the behavior of their molecular
components such as single genes and proteins. �
 Often the focus is on systems at the level of pathways and regulatory
networks, but analysis at this level has consequences for the understanding of
disease, multicellular development, and evolution. �  Continuing improvements in laboratory instrumentation and data
sources (including genome-scale sequence data, expression data, and many types
of imagery) have made it possible and often essential to understand such
biological systems  in silico  � meaning in computer simulation. 

     

 Specific research directions in systems biology at SISL
build on early work in gene regulation network modeling [1] applied to
Drosophila development [2]. �  More recent
developmental modeling has added two-way interactions between material
properties of tissues and genetic/signaling regulatory networks [3] (figures 1,
2 and 3). �  Signal transduction is
receiving increasingly detailed modeling treatment [4] to include important
phenomena such as scaffold proteins and membrane localization in signal
transduction complexes. �  Eucaryotic gene
regulation is open to much more detailed modeling [5] than in our previous gene
regulation network approaches. �  These
efforts are substantially aided by mathematical model generation software such
as the  Cellerator 
reactions-to-model translation system �
 [4,6] (see figure 4) and, in the future, the open-source  SIGMOID pathway modeling database
project .

 Solar System Exploration Research Area 

     

 Planetary surfaces are rich in complex geological processes
and in the resources required to sustain life as we know it. �  They provide challenging domains for
scientific exploration by orbiting satellites, robots, and human explorers
equipped with automated assistants. �
 Future intelligent space systems will benefit from a built-in
understanding of geological and other planetary processes, and will be capable
of scientific inference about such processes. �
 Unlike current spacecraft and missions, future space exploration systems
will be deeply affected by biotechnology in their design, fabrication, and
support for human explorers. �  Space
medicine problems such as microgravity-induced muscle atrophy and the health
risks of space radiation, currently major obstacles for human missions to Mars,
will be understood and mitigated. 

     

 Specific research areas currently include statistical
modeling for geological process inference, causes of microgravity-induced
muscle atrophy, and transgenic plant development models for space agriculture.
