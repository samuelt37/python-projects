We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

We study the graphs formed by non-crossing circular arcs in the plane,
having a vertex for each arc and an edge for each point where an arc
endpoint touches the interior of another arc.
