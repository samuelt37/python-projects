  Welcome to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository!  






 We currently maintain 360 data sets as a service to the machine learning community.
You may   view all data sets   through our 
searchable interface.  Our  old web 
site  
is still available, for those who prefer the old format.  For a general overview of the Repository, please visit our  About page .
