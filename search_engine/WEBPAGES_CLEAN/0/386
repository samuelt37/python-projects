  Constraint Solving 

More a technique than an application, geometric constraint solving
consists of finding configurations of points, lines, circles,
and other geometric figures constrained to have certain relations to
each other.  This sort of problem finds applications in a number of areas
including
 computer aided design ,
 molecular modeling ,
and  robot motion planning .
