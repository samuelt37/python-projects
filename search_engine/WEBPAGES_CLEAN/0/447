              Abstract   
	    One popular and efﬁcient scheme for solving combinatorial
optimization problems over graphical models exactly is depth-ﬁrst
Branch and Bound. However, when the algorithm exploits problem
decomposition using AND/OR search spaces, its anytime behavior breaks
down. This article 1) analyzes and demonstrates this inherent conﬂict
between effective exploitation of problem decomposition (through
AND/OR search spaces) and the anytime behavior of depth- ﬁrst search
(DFS), 2) presents a new search scheme to address this issue while
maintaining desirable DFS memory properties, and 3) analyzes and
demonstrates its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical
evaluation. Our work is applicable to any problem that can be cast as
search over an AND/OR search space.
