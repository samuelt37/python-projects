The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

We study the graphs formed by non-crossing circular arcs in the plane,
having a vertex for each arc and an edge for each point where an arc
endpoint touches the interior of another arc.
