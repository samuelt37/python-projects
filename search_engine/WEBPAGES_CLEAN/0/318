   Error handling   
     People make errors routinely... 

   Options that facilitate error recovery should be on by default (e.g., checkpoint files, UNDO).  
    Errors should be recognized
and reacted to as soon as possible.              
    Automatically correct  minor 
user errors (and preferably point this out to the user)          
  
    For major user errors,
offer correction if possible.          
     If not, provide error message.    
         
Error messages    

   Should explain 
       what the problem is             
       
        what the user can do to
solve the problem (at least by examples)          
      
    Should be formulated in
terms of the user  '  s task  
    Should be polite; the word
"unfortunately" should be avoided    
      Examples:         

      

    Program errors  
   

    In the case of a program
crash, give users the opportunity to save their files, or save
(checkpoint) files automatically.  
     Allow users to abort
programs, and to relaunch them.
