Max flows in  O ( nm ) time, or better
 
 
Will Devanny
 

 
We present improved polynomial time algorithms for the max flow problem
defined on a network with  n  nodes and  m  arcs. We show how
to solve the max flow problem in  O ( nm ) time, improving upon the
best previous algorithm due to King, Rao, and Tarjan, who
solved the max flow problem in
 O ( nm  log  m /( n  log  n )  n )
time. In the case that  m  =  O ( n ), we
improve the running time to  O ( n  2 /log  n ).
We further improve the running time in the case that
 U  *  =  U  max / U  min 
is not too large, where  U  max  denotes the largest
finite capacity and  U  min  denotes the smallest non-zero
capacity. If
log( U  * ) =  O (n 1/3  log −3  n ),
we show how to solve the max flow problem in
 O ( nm /log  n ) steps.
In the case that
log( U  * ) =  O (log  k   n )
for some fixed positive integer  k , we show how to solve the
max flow problem in  Õ (n 8/3 ) time. This latter
algorithm relies on a subroutine for fast matrix multiplication.
