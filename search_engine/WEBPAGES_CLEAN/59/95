Data ordering for visualization  Dave Goggin , ICS, UC Irvine 

 This week's talk is about a problem of visualizing
document-keyword incidences by permuting rows and columns of 0-1
matrices. The permutation minimizing the length of the boundary
between 0's and 1's can be represented as a pair of optimum
traveling salesman paths in two Hamming spaces; one can then apply
various heuristics for approximate TSP solutions.
