Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,
and find an O(n 3/2 ) time algorithm for testing whether
a rule set contains any ambiguities.
