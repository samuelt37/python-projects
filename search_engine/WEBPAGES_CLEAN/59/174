       We are using two electronic textbooks. You must purchase both.</strong> 
       (1)  Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet ,   James Kurose &amp; Keith Ross, Pearson.  There are 6th edtiion (2013) and 7th edition (2017) versions of the book. Since the 7th edition (2017) isn't available as an electronic textbook yet, we'll be using the 6th edition (2013) version. It is available as an electronic textbook to rent for 1 year for $70 at the  VitalSource webpage for the book . Alternatively, the 7th edition (2017) version of the book is available in print to buy for $166 at the  Pearson webpage for the book , and the 6th edition (2013) version of the book is available at other retailers. 
       (2)  The Economy Today , Bradley Schiller, McGraw-Hill and  Communication Networks , Alberto Leon-Garcia, McGraw-Hill. Available as an electronic textbook to rent for 1 year for $25 at the  McGraw-Hill website for the book . 
       You should also budget for printing portions of these electronic textbooks. You might find online access too slow or cumbersome, especially when flipping through a large number of pages. If so, please print the relevant portions of the material. You may also find it convenient to print the pages with assigned problems.
