 Shawn Shah spotlight 

 
 

 Yahoo! </strong>
 Technical Yahoo probably wasn't a title that Shawn Shah '05 imagined having as an undergraduate major in information and computer science. 
 As a software engineer for Yahoo! Shopping’s database team in Sunnyvale, CA, Shawn is responsible for co-managing internal web tools and the product matching system. Inspired by his experience in ICS, Shawn hopes to one day launch a business that will deliver a revolutionary service to the world.

 “In recent years ideas like blogging, syndication, and tagging have improved the way millions of people create and consume information every day. I am amazed at how even a small group of innovators can make a huge impact in such a short time,” explains Shawn, who was an Extreme Computing competition winner in 2004 and 2005. 
 Shawn keeps in touch with classmates and faculty mentors through e-mail and instant messaging. He also attends UCIAA and UCI sponsored events in the Bay Area often. In his free time he enjoys reading, watching his favorite television shows, and working on personal projects. 
 As for advice to future ICS students? Shawn says, “Go beyond what the average student is doing and explore the resources available to students. If you think big and take advantage of those opportunities, you will have a wonderful college experience.”
