More Multiprocessor Scheduling with Rejection  Steve Seiden , ICS, UC Irvine 

 Multiprocessor scheduling with rejection was introduced by
Bartal, Leonardi, Marchetti-Spaccamela, Sgall and Stougie in
SODA`96. These authors show a deterministic 2.61803-competitive
algorithm for this problem, and show that no algorithm achieves a
lower competitive ratio. We introduce a new variant of scheduling
with rejection where the accepted jobs may be be scheduled
preemptively as in Chen, van Vliet and Woeginger ESA`94. We show
that with preemption it is possible to do better. We present a
deterministic algorithm for preemptive multiprocessor scheduling
with rejection and show that it is 2.38743-competitive.
