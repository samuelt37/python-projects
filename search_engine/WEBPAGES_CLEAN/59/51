   1. Introduction and Timeline      
 

  Executive Summary       
    
Analysis of a number of important human brain circuits has led to specific and distinct hypotheses of their functions.  Simulations at various levels of simplification and abstraction have demonstrated substantial computational power and efficiency of the hypothesized operations.  
    
Extensive mathematical characterization of these functions, and comparison with related algorithms have been performed and published in scientific journals.  
    
Many of the resulting derived algorithmic methods have led to applications in military, commercial, and medical domains.
    
Specific anatomical, physiological, and behavioral predictions have been tested in animal and human experiments, with results that support the growing body of hypotheses.  
    
Further construction of computational simulation systems, more extensive mathematical analyses, and continued empirical testing of biological and behavioral predictions, are ongoing in our laboratory.
