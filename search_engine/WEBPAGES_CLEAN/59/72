8.5 OEExprType
 

 
Thee OEExprType namespace is used to identify built-in OEChem
expressions used in graph matching operations.  The values in the
namespace are returned by the OEExprBase::GetType() method of the
corresponding expression implementations.

  
    
namespace OEExprType
{
  const unsigned int Undefined     = 0;
  const unsigned int And           = 1;
  const unsigned int Or            = 2;
