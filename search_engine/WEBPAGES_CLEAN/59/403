 AND/OR Branch-and-Bound for Linkage Analysis 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
AND/OR search spaces have recently been introduced as a unifying paradigm
for advanced algorithmic schemes for graphical models. The main virtue of this
representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can translate
into exponential time savings for search algorithms. In [MD05a] we introduced a
linear space AND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) search scheme that explores the
AND/OR search tree for solving optimization tasks. In this paper we extend the algorithm
by equipping it with a context-based adaptive caching scheme similar to good
and nogood recording, thus it explores an AND/OR graph rather than the AND/OR
tree. We also improve the algorithm by using a new heuristic for generating close to
optimal height pseudo-trees, based on a well known recursive decomposition of the
hypergraph representation. We illustrate our results using a number of benchmark
networks, including the very challenging ones that arise in genetic linkage analysis.
