 Data Characteristics 

The data comes from Internet Information Server (IIS) logs for
msnbc.com and news-related portions of msn.com for the entire day of
September, 28, 1999 (Pacific Standard Time).  Each sequence in the
dataset corresponds to page views of a user during that twenty-four
hour period.  Each event in the sequence corresponds to a user's
request for a page.  Requests are not recorded at the finest level of
detail---that is, at the level of URL, but rather, they are recorded
at the level of page category (as determined by a site administrator).
The categories are "frontpage", "news", "tech", "local", "opinion",
"on-air", "misc", "weather", "health", "living", "business", "sports",
"summary", "bbs" (bulletin board service), "travel", "msn-news", and
"msn-sports".  Any page requests served via a caching mechanism were
not recorded in the server logs and, hence, not present in the data.

 Other Relevant Information 

  Number of users: 989818 
  Average number of vitis per user: 5.7 
  Number of URLs per category: 10 to 5000

Each category is associated--in order--with an integer starting with
"1".  For example, "frontpage" is associated with 1, "news" with 2,
and "tech" with 3.  Each row below "% Sequences:" describes the
hits--in order--of a single user.  For example, the first user hits
"frontpage" twice, and the second user hits "news" once.
