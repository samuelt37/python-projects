 Visions for WebDAV<body>

  Visions for WebDAV  
      Participants in WebDAV have many views on what it is:
 
  A protocol for collaborative authoring
  A large-grain Web-based network file system, with nice high-latency behavior.
  A data integration technology for accessing a wide range of repositories
  document mgmt. systems, configuration mgmt. systems, filesystems, etc.
    A protocol for remote software engineering
       All views are correct!
