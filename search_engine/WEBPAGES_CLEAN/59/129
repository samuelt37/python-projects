  Goal:      

  ICS H197 provides an opportunity for undergraduate honors students
in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences to learn about
the research taking place in the School and to begin to get involved with this
research. The major purpose of this course is to help you learn what sort of
research is going on, which people do what, and how to get connected with a
research project. The course will also provide a general introduction to the
scientific and technical research enterprise, including the research
literature, research IP and entrepreneurship, how to give a successful
technical talk, and the responsible conduct of research  . Various
enrichment activities include a library-based introduction to searching the
research literature, faculty panel on improving your graduate school
applications, and the opportunity to practice and improve technical talk
presentation skills in a live talk to the class.    

  One
of your major goals in this course is to gain an understanding of what research
is being pursued in the School and what areas might be of interest to you for
your project. This is  crucial,  since it should help
you complete your second goal, selection of your faculty advisor. Remember that
the arrangement must be mutually acceptable, so there is no guarantee that the
first faculty member you talk to will say yes; it may be, for example, that
they have no suitable project in mind at the time you ask.    

  It
is not imperative that you begin your research immediately next quarter if your
schedule for graduation allows you enough time. However, there are some
important advantages to starting fairly soon, and we encourage you to begin by
spring quarter. Starting early gives you more flexibility with regard to
finishing the rest of your degree requirements, especially if you want to
continue the research for more than two quarters. Also, students often find
that those faculty members who have supervised their honors research project
are good sources for letters of recommendation; they will be in the best
position to comment on your ability if you are well into your research project.    

  

   

  Please Note:      

   (1)   
    Two types of students take this course: students
in the ICS Honors Program (ICSHP), and students in the  Campuswide 
Honors Program (CHP). In many ways the requirements are the same for both types
of students: you are to select a faculty advisor, do two or more quarters of
research with that advisor, and produce a report which is considered to be of
honors quality. However, students in the  Campuswide 
Honors Program should discuss their plans with counselors in the CHP, in order
to make sure that they are meeting the requirements of that program.    

   (2)   
    Until this year, ICS-H197 met on Friday with the
former ICS-200, a weekly seminar series that formerly introduced you to
research by ICS faculty. Last year, ICS-200 was discontinued by ICS, and
replaced instead by separate seminars run by the departments of Informatics and
of Computer Science.    *Instead* of
the former ICS-200, you should now attend one or the other of your choice of
these two departmental research seminars:    

    CompSci         200S           SEM IN COMPSCI
RSCH       F
11:00-11:50    

   In4matx  
 209S           SEMINAR
INFORMATICS       
 F    3:00- 4:50p    

  You must attend at least one quarter of at least
one of these seminars to qualify for the ICS Honors Program.    You should do so this quarter; but if
you have a schedule conflict, you may attend during the first quarter in which
you do not have a schedule conflict.  
 Please let me know if you are unable to attend this quarter.    

   (3)   
    We are in the process of transitioning the ICS
H197 class into a more flexible largely-online course oriented more along the
lines of "Introduction to Undergraduate Research."    Please help develop and debug the new
format and content.    We'll work out
the details as we go along.      

 

  

  Class Setup:      

  This
course is graded Pass/Not Pass, and the principal formal requirement is that
you attend and participate. You must read (at least) one research paper by an
ICS faculty member, and attend (at least) one ICS research seminar, CS-200S or
In4matx-209S.    

  Some
of the class exercises may involve students giving feedback to fellow students,
and your active participation is necessary for everyone to get the most benefit
from this. Occasional absences are inevitable given busy schedules, and will be
excused on a case-by-case basis; make sure you sign the attendance sheet each
class period you attend.    

  ICS H198: Honors Research    

  To
complete the honors program you must do two quarters of independent, supervised
work (ICS 198) with your faculty advisor. (In some cases, your advisor might
ask you to take a graduate course to substitute for the first quarter.) Passing
the 198s does not necessarily guarantee successful completion of the honors
program, however. For the ICSHP, the thesis report on your honors work must be
certified by your faculty advisor and by the program advisor to be of honors
quality. (Again, students in the CHP should keep in touch with counselors in
that program about the requirements.)    

   o         students    majoring in
ICS or CS can count completion of two ICS H198s as one project course.    

   o         students    majoring in
CSE can count CSE 181ABC as one of the ICS H198s required for the Honors
Program.    

   o         students    majoring in
CSE can count  Engr  H199 as one of the ICS H198s
required for the Honors Program.

                 Homework
#3, due Wed., 24 Oct.:     

                  Identify
      five grad schools you might apply
to.    For each school, identify one
professor there with whom you might work.      

   o   
     Email  your
list to Dr. Lathrop by Wed., 24 Oct.        

   o   
    The reason for this requirement is so that when you write your
Statement of Purpose for each school, you will be able to mention at least one
professor  *from that school*  who
interests you.    

   o   
    Some professors will do a global string search for their name
through all of the applicant's Statements of Purpose, and then preferentially
read those applications that mention their name.    

   o   
    Thus, if you want to improve the chances that your application
actually will be read seriously, it is helpful to you to mention names of
professors at that school who interest you.    Of course, if you mention a long list of
names it will be obvious spam, so mention no more than one to three. Also,
briefly mention something personal that attracts your interest about each,
again to indicate that it isn’t just impersonal spam.    

   o   
    These remarks apply mainly to Ph.D. applications.    M.S. applications usually do not receive
as much carefully individual scrutiny as do Ph.D. applications.    

   o   
      Even if you currently do not
intend to apply to graduate school, you still must attend the Panel and do the
homework.         If you ever change your mind later in
your career, after you know more than you do now, you will want to be properly
prepared.       

   o   
           

         

   Week 4:     

                     Wed., 24 Oct.,  Meet
in DBH-6011 , ICS Faculty Panel on Improving your Grad School
Applications.

   Homework #4, Due Wed., 31 Oct.:     

    Identify three interesting ICS
research areas, and three interesting professors in each.     
[Instructions]     

   o   
     Email  your
1-page Summary to Dr. Lathrop by Wed., 31 Oct.        

   o   
    The point to this exercise is to show you that you have very
broad interests, and that you can find many ICS professors who might sponsor
interesting research.         

   o   
      If you already have a
research advisor and topic, all three research areas must be entirely
different.         The intent is to broaden your exposure
to ICS research.

                           You
learned the basics in kindergarten:  
 Don’t lie, don’t cheat,  don’t 
steal. 

                                       *
Don’t lie:    Don’t make
up false data or otherwise falsify results. 

                                       *
Don’t cheat:    Don’t
misrepresent your data as something it is not or as better than it is. 

                                       *
Don’t steal:    Don’t use the
words or data of others without proper credit and citation; don’t
plagiarize. 

                           More
complicated cases may require you to consult for advice and disclose conflicts of
interest so they can be managed.  
 When in doubt, seek advice and disclose conflicts.
