20.4.1 OEIsCommonIsotope 
 

 
This predicate (function returning a bool) determines whether the
combination of atomic number and mass is reasonable.  Obviously the
mass must be greater than or equal to the atomic number.
Additionally, this function tabulates the complete list of isotopes
accepted as having been observed in high energy physics experiments in
particle accelerators.  A mass of zero always returns false.
