 CLion IDE: Downloading, Installing, and Testing 
 a
  
  
 Download/Install/Test the CLion IDE 
  
 CLion  is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses the
   Cygwin  toolset to develop/test C++ programs.
 It occupies about .6 GB on disk.
  
Before installing CLion in this handout, you should have already downloaded and
  installed the  Cygwin  toolset
  (if you haven't, go back and do so).
  
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing CLion.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely, before performing the action that it
  describes.
  
This document shows the installation of CLion version 2016.1.3; I installed
  this version originally, but I am now using verson 2016.3.1.
You should install the latest version to be compatible with how CLion is
  used in this document.

    The following  Customize CLion Featured plugins 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Click the  Start using CLion  button on this window.
     
    The following splash should appear on your screen.
      
       
    Eventually CLion loads and the following  Welcome to CLion 
       pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Click the  New Project  button on this window.
     
    The following  New Project 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    In the  Location  textbox, at the end of the path, replace
       untititled  by  trivialtest ; leave the  C++ Executable 
      and  C++11  selected.
  

   Click the  OK  button on this window.
     
    If a  Tip of the Day  pop-up window appears, click it  Close 
      button.
      
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    Note that the right pane lists the tabs  CMakeLists.txt 
      (which contains the project's  make  code) and  main.cpp 
      (which is shown and contains a trivial C++ program).
      
    In this window, I right-clicked in the gray area between the project and
      the  driver.cpp  panes and selected  Show Line Numbers .
      
       

    It useful to click the triangle to the left of  trivialtest  in the
      Project/left pane.
      
       
    Every project will contain a  cmake-build-debug  folder, which will
      ultimately contain the compiled code (executable) for the project.
    Later, we will see how to put data files in that folder; the executable
      uses that folder by default for reading/writing files.
      
    

   Depress the  File  tab and select  Settings  as shown in the
       following illustraton.
     
       
    The following  Settings 
      window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Undisclose the  Appearance &amp; Behavior  item, disclose
      the  Build, Execution, Deployment  item, and select
       CMake .
     
    The following  Settings 
      window should appear on your screen (see below for filling in the
       CMake options  textbox).
      
       
    Copy and paste the text   -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang++ -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang   
      into the  CMake Options  textbox.
    These CMake switches tells CLion that we will be using the Clang C++/C
      compilers.
    Doing so never will be wrong, but it might be unnecessary if you have
      only one C++/C compiler on your system.
      
    Another way to fix this problem is to ensure the following lines start
      your  CMakeLists.txt  file (see part 12 below, which shows the
      last line). 
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3.2)

  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang++")
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang")

  project(test_all_data_types)

  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")  
      
    If you do have multiple compilers on your machine and forget to specify
       these  CMake  switches or  CMakeLists.txt  options (or
       enter the wrong information) you will might encounter compliation
       problems.
    You will setup all projects in the same way, so once you do a few, all the
      rest will be setup similarly.
  

   Click the  OK  button on this window.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    It shows CLion checking whether the CMake switches you entered are legal,
      and updating the  cmake-build-debug  folder; it may take a few
      minutes.
    You can scroll through the  CMake  pane at the bottom, to see what
      happened.
      
    If you want to examine the  CMakeLists.txt  file, click on it (in
      the right pane).
    It will update the right pane to
      
       
    If you do this, click on  main.cpp  (in the right pane), to return to
      the C++ program.
  

   Click the   (Build icon) on this
      window.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    The results of the build appear in the  Message Build  pane.
    This  trivialtest  C++ program has now been compiled and linked
      successfully;
      either could have dispayed errors in the  Message Build  pane, which
      would have to be corrected before the program could be run.
      
    
  
   
   Click the   (Run icon) on this
      window.
     
    The following  Edit Configuration 
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    For the  Target  dropdown, select  trivialtest  as shown.
    The  Executable  dropdown will change to  trivialtest  
      automatically.

   Click the   ( Run  button)
      on this window.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    The results of running the program print in the  Run  pane.
  

   To edit rebuild, and rerun the program, change the output string to
       "Goodbye, World!"  and then click the
        (Run icon) again.
    CLion will rebuild the project (which contains no errors; you will briefly
      see the Message Build pane as shown above), and then rerun it.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    The results of rerunning the program appear in the  Run  pane.
  

   If we create a syntax error (remove the  ;  at the
      end of the  cout  line), CLion will highlight  endl  (the last
      token before the error), show a red squiggle under the error, and put a
      purple an underline at the right end of that column in the
       main.cpp  pane (by hovering over it, an error message appears);
      CLion will also put a white  !  surrounded by a red circle at the
      end of the top line in the  main.cpp  pane.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    To try to rebuild and rerun this code (it will fail), click the
        (Run icon) again.
      
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    The failed results of attempting to rebuild the program appear in the
       Messages Build  pane; here I have repositioned the
      separation between the  mail.cpp  and  Message Build  panes
      to show the entire program and all the errors allow all errors to appear.
   
We will now continue by learning how to download a CLion project and run it.
During the quarter, you will be asked to do this for all programming
  assignments and many quizzes.
 

   Section 3) Testing Downloadable CLion Projects with the Course Libraries 
 
In this section you will learn more about CLion, by downloading the course
  libraries and then downloading/building/running a CLion project that contains
  various programs that use these libraries.
  
   Create a new shortcut named  ClionProjects 
      (to the folder  C:\Users\yourname\ClionProjects ,
       which CLion should have creatred, now containing only
       the  trivialtest  folder) 
      and place it on your desktop near the shortcut that
      you use to start CLion.
 

   Download and unzip the file  template ;
    Copy its three folders ( courselib ,  gtestlib , and
       test_all_data_types ) into the folder  ClionProjects 
      shortcuts; it should already contain the  trivialtest  folder,
      created by the operations above.
     
    Generally, whenever you download CLion projects, you will unzip them and 
      then copy their folders into the folder that  ClionProjects 
      shortcuts.
  

   Click the  File  tab near the upper-left corner of the CLion window;
      then click the  Open  option in the pull-down menu.
     
    The following  pop-up window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    You may need to scroll this window and disclose/undisclose various folders
      to make it appear as shown above.
    The  Users  folder should contain a folder with your name
      ( Pattis  for me); it should contain a folder with the
       ClionProjects  foler; it should contain the three folders
       courselib ,  gtestlib ,  test_all_data_types ,
      and  trivialtest .
      
    Click on the  test_all_data_types  folder, so that it is highlighted.
  

   Click the  OK  button on this window.
     
    The following  Open Project  window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Click the  This Window  button on this window.
    (clicking  New Window  creates a second project window, which
      is sometimes useful)
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       

   Scroll downward, select lines 30-35, and press  ctrl-/ ,
      which uncomments the chosen lines.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    If you press  ctrl-/  again, it will comment the lines; so
      this command really means  toggle-comment  on the selected lines.
    Before continuing ensure lines 30-35 are uncommented.
  

   Click the   (Run icon) on this
      window.
     
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    First it will show the  Message Build  pane; it should be successful,
      so it should next show the  Run  pane.
      
    Experiment with this driver by entering commands (and their arguments, when
      prompted) to better understand the  set  data type.
    You can enter the  q  command to terminate the driver, or you can
      click the   (Stop icon) on the
      left of the  Run  pane to terminate the driver.
    After terminating the driver, click the
        (Close icon) left of the
       Run  pane to close/remove the Run pane.
      
    I suggest that you try terminating the driver with a  q  command; then,
      rerun the program and terminate it with the Stop icon.
  

   We briefly noted the  cmake-build-debug  folder; now we will examine
      it in more detail, but via an Explorer window, not via CLion.
    Click on the  ClionProjects  shortcut to open an Explorer window,
      then double-click its  test_all_data_types  folder, and finally
      double-click its  cmake-build-debug  folder.
     
    The following Explorer window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    Whenever you create a project, a  cmake-build-debug  folder will
      appear in its project folder.
    We have built two projects in this handout:  test_all_data_types 
      and  trivialtest ; each has its own  cmake-build-debug  folder.
      

   Double-click the file  test_all_data_types.exe  in this folder to run
      this program in Windows, outside of CLion.
    The following MS-DOS window should appear on your screen.
     
       
      
    If the error pop-window
     
       
    appears, you must also add  C:\cygwin64\bin  to the
      user variable  PATH , briefly illustrated below
      (also see step 15 in the  Cygwin  handout).
      
       
      
    Experiment with this driver by entering commands (and their arguments, when
      prompted); it runs as it did in the CLion Run Pane.
    Note that when you enter the  q  command the program terminates and the
      MS-DOS window  immediately  disappears.
     
    So, when a program we run under CLion terminates, its Run Pane retains the
      information printed (by  cout ) after the run terminates, but when we
      run it directly in an MS-DOS window, the window disappears after the run
      terminates.
    For example, if you find the  trivialtest.exe  file and run it by
      double-clicking this file, its MS-DOS window will run and then immediately
      disappear.
      
    For a program that  produces lots of output  and
        does not terminate  (we can always put an input statement at the
        end, so it doesn't terminate until the user enters something) it is 
        often faster to run the program in an MS-DOS window, rather than in
        CLion.
  

   Find the  input files  folder in the  test_all_data_types  folder
      and copy all of its  .txt  data files into the
       cmake-build-debug  folder that contains the
       test_all_data_types.exe  file.
    Copy these files using an Explorer window or the Project pane in the CLion
      window (after disclosing the  cmake-build-debug  and 
       input files  folders).
     
    Then, run the program (either in the CLion Run pane or a MS-DOS window; try
      doing it from both places) and
      issue the  lf  command (load from file); when prompted for the file
      name, just press the  Enter  key to choose the default
      ( loadset.txt ).
      
    When running using the CLion Run pane, the following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
     IMPORTANT : If a program reads data files, the root folder for the
         specifying the files is the folder in which the  .exe  file
         appears.
       It is simplest to copy all the data files into this folder.
       An alternative would be to leave the files in the  input files 
         folder, copy the entire folder, and then refer to these file names like
          input files\loadset.txt .
  

   A typical project folder may have more than one  .cpp  file with a
     main function (as  test_all_data_types  has).
    Only one of these  .cpp  files can have its main function uncommented,
      otherwise the build will fail.
    When working on project, it is typical to 
     
       Comment-out code in one  .cpp  file.
        Uncomment code in another  .cpp  file.
        Rebuild/Rerun the newly uncommented  .cpp  file.
       
    In the  test_all_data_types  project folder, the  driver.cpp 
      file has many main functions: we uncommented one (in step 6 above) to
      allow us to run the Set driver.
    If more than one main function is uncommented, attempting to build the code
      will result in the compiler specifying a  redefinition of 'main' 
      error.
      
    The  test_all_data_types  project folder also contains many  .cpp 
      files (their names all start with  test ) that each contain one main
      function (each is a  Googletest  for one data type).
    If more than one file contains a main function, attempting to build the
      code will result in the linker specifying a
       multiple definition of 'main'  error.
      
    To switch this project from running the Set driver to the Set Googletest
       Comment-out lines 30-35 in the  driver.cpp  file: select them
            and type the  ctrl-/  command to toggle the commenting
            on the selected lines (comment them).
        Scroll down the Project Pane (on the left) and double-click the
             test_set.cpp  file so that it appears as an editor tab.
        Type the  ctrl-a  command to select  all  the lines in this
            file.
        Type the  ctrl-/  command to toggle the commenting on the
            selected lines (uncomment them).
       
    Click the   (Run icon).
    When prompted enter the three lines of information shown.
      
    The following  CLion 
      project window should appear on your screen.
      
       
    
We are now at the end of this handout.
You will not need to repeat the first two sections during the course, but you
  will frequently download project folders and use them as demonstrated in
  section 3.
