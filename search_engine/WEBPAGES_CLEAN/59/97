 Staying up to date 
   In a wiki, lots of things can change in a short time, since anyone can edit, add, or remove pages at any time.       For this reason you can easily follow these changes on the page   RecentChanges </strong>.       Listed for every change is:      a link to a page showing differences.     a link to the changed page (as well as the information for this page).     when the change was made.     who made the change.     a comment made for the change.          If you are logged in to the wiki, you can set a temporal  bookmark  using this page. In that case, the wiki will remember which changes you have already seen and will only display the new ones after that.
