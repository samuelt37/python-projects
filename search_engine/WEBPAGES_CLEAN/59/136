A Classic Critique of a Technology
 

In   Phaedrus 
 , written 360 B.C. by Plato,
Socrates tells Phaedrus the following story:
 
  
At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god,
whose name was Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred
to him, and he was the inventor of many arts, such as arithmetic
and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice,
but his great discovery was the use of letters.
 
Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country
of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the
Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by
them Ammon. To came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring
that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of
the he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several
uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved
or disapproved of them.
  
It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in
praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters,
This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better
memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.
  
Thamus replied:
 
O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not
always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own
inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who
are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own
children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they
cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create
forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use
their memories; they will trust to the external written
characters and not remember of themselves.
  
The specific which you
have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and
you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of
truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned
nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally
know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of
wisdom without the reality.
