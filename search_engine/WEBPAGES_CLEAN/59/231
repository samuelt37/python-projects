 Tyler Kaczmarek 
  
  A Quick Bio  
 
I am a Third-year Ph.D student at the University of California, Irvine working in applied cryptography under  Gene Tsudik .  
My current research deals with Usable Security, particularly the prevalence of user errors in the presence of adversarial noise across multiple sensory inputs. I am also developing a technique for passive deauthentication based
on biometric data. 
In the long term, I am interested in the development and evaluation of usable security protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
In the past I have worked on the development and deployment of an accessible, coercion resistant voting machine.
