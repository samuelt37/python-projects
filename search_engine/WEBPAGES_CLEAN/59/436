        Bounding Graphical Models Processing by Hypertree Width.

              Abstract   

             In 2000, Gottlob et al. [3] introduced a new graph parameter,
the hypertree width, and showed that it provides a broader characterization
of tractable constraint networks than the treewidth. In 2005 this observation
was extended to general graphical models [5], showing that the hypertree
width yields bounds on inference algorithms. This paper explores further
the practical properties of the hypertree width parameter
for bounding the complexity of constraint satisfaction and optimization
tasks. To that end we study empirically the effectiveness of the treewidth
vs. hypertree width over common network benchmarks.
