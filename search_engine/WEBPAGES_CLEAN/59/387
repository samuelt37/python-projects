template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool AddData(unsigned int tag, const T t)
template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool AddData(const char *tag, const T t)
    
These template methods associate and store a copy of the data passed as the
second argument with the tag identifier given as the first argument.  Integer
tags should be allocated using the OEGetTag (Section  10.7 ) function.
Multiple calls to AddData of a OEBase derived class instance will result in
multiple copies of data being stored.  The AddData method does not overwrite
data stored by previous calls.

  
    
template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool AddData(unsigned int tag, const T t, unsigned int len)
template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool AddData(const char *tag, const T t, unsigned int len)
    
These template methods associate and store a copy of the data pointed to by
the second argument with the tag identifier given as the first argument.  The
third argument passed to the method is used to denote the length of the array
pointed to by the second argument.  The array length must be specified so that
data can be copied directly.  Integer tags should be allocated using the
OEGetTag (Section  10.7 ) function.  Multiple calls to AddData of a
OEBase derived class instance will result in multiple copies of data being
stored.  The AddData method does not overwrite data stored by previous calls.
