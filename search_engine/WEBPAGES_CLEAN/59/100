     Processing Boolean Queries Over Belief Networks 
 Rina Dechter ( dechter@ics.uci.edu ) 
 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a variable elimination
method for computing the probability of a
cnf query over a belief network. We present
a bucket-elimination algorithm whose complexity 
is controlled by the induced-width of
the moral graph combined with the interaction 
graph of the cnf. We show that the algorithm 
can be easily extended to answer a
host of additional cnf-related queries such as
finding the most probable model of the cnf
theory, or finding the most probable tuple
satisfying the cnf theory, as well as belief assessment 
conditioned on disjunctive type observations.
