 Paul 's
 
Erdos Number 
 
 
 
The publication path linking me to Paul Erdos is:
    Paul Erdos -&gt;
   Ernst Specker -&gt;
    Karl Lieberherr  -&gt;
   Paul Dourish
   
(The former shortest path was Erdos -&gt;
Allen R. Freedman -&gt;
 Richard
Ladner  -&gt;
 Anthony LaMarca  -&gt;
Paul Dourish.)

  
In turn, this gives me an "Einstein number" of 5 (unless there's some
shortcut, but that seems unlikely). However, my
 Bacon number 
remains infinite.
