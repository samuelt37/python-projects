The Workshop on

TWIST 99 aims to gather participants from industry and
academia who are researching or developing software
technologies that scale to the Internet.

Internet-scale namespaces have emerged as a crucial issue in scaling
software and network technologies to the numbers of people, devices, 
and agents online.
Every namespace, from MIME type to stock symbol to domain name,
represents a bundle of political, economic, social, and technical
decisions.  Many namespaces are bumping into new limits to growth:
human-friendly names for Web resources, the domain name service,
public key infrastructures (PKI), and ad-hoc federation of embedded
computers a la Jini, to name four. These are not merely limits of
sheer massiveness: the latest generation of commercial directory
servers claim to vend hundreds of millions of names with ease, as
do planetary-scale Web search engines.

  

The 
 
TWIST  series
provides a forum for discussion and
enables quick dissemination of current ideas within a
well-targeted audience. The goals of the workshop series are developing
a better understanding among the different communities
of interest, improved definition of requirements for scaling to the
Internet, better appreciation of the application domains that
require or benefit from this approach, and suggestions for fruitful
research directions. 

  
This engaging two-day workshop
is being convened with the following goals in mind:
   Survey the diversity of namespaces already in use at
    Internet scale,
     Identify the uniquely Internet-Scale issues of namespace
    management, beyond sheer size scaling to include political,
    economic, and technological limits,
     Discuss namespace management in the context of application domains,
    with a particular emphasis on electronic commerce,
     Debate potential approaches for building self-organizing solutions
    for domain naming, hierarchical public key infrastructure,
    resource discovery, and device federation.
  
 
New challenges specific to Internet scale include:
   Control: who has control over the namespace;
     Mobility: how rapidly a name to address binding can change;
     Locality: the same name having different meaning for different
       speakers depending on geographic, or other context;
     Interoperability: standard resolution protocols, and their
       mechanisms for generating network effects.
   

TWIST 99 is a two day event with a single track of
invited speakers structured as:
  

  Thursday, August 19: 
        Presentations on Internet-Scale Namespaces   Friday, August 20: 
        Intensive group work to develop scenarios of Internet scale 
        naming, and  
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp
        identify cross-cutting issues for Internet scale
                       namespaces.

TWIST '99 is a follow on to the highly successful
 
Workshop on Internet Scale Event Notification (WISEN) 
held on July 13-14, 1998 at UC Irvine. In response to WISEN's positive
reception,
  IRUS  
has evolved the event into a workshop series with a broadened scope.
