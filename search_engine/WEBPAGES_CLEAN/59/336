        AND/OR Branch-and-Bound Search for Combinatorial Optimization in Graphical Models    
        Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
This is the first of two papers presenting and evaluating the power of a new framework
for combinatorial optimization in graphical models, based on AND/OR search spaces.
We introduce a new generation of depth-first Branch-and-Bound algorithms that explore
the AND/OR search tree using static and dynamic variable orderings. The virtue of the
AND/OR representation of the search space is that its size may be far smaller than that of
a traditional OR representation, which can translate into significant time savings for search
algorithms. The focus of this paper is on linear space search which explores the AND/OR
search tree. In the second paper we explore memory intensive AND/OR search algorithms.
In conjunction with the AND/OR search space we investigate the power of the mini-bucket
heuristics in both static and dynamic setups. We focus on two most common optimization
problems in graphical models: finding the Most Probable Explanation in Bayesian networks
and solving Weighted CSPs. In extensive empirical evaluations we demonstrate that the
new AND/OR Branch-and-Bound approach improves considerably over the traditional OR
search strategy and show how various variable ordering schemes impact the performance
of the AND/OR search scheme.
