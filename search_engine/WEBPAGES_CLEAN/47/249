   Abstract:  
Horizontally partitioned data caches are a popular architectural
feature in which the processor maintains two or more
data caches at the same level of hierarchy. Horizontally partitioned
caches help reduce cache pollution and thereby improve
performance. Consequently most previous research has
focused on exploiting horizontally partitioned data caches to
improve performance, and achieve energy reduction only as
a byproduct of performance improvement. In constrast, in
this paper we show that optimizing for performance tradesoff
several opportunities for energy reduction. Our experiments
on a HP iPAQ h4300-like memory subsystem demonstrate
that optimizing for energy consumption results in up to
127% less memory subsystem energy consumption than the
performance optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that
energy optimal solution incurs on average only 1.7% performance
penalty. Therefore, with energy consumption becoming
a first class design constraint, there is a need for compilation
techniques aimed at energy reduction. To achieve
aforementioned energy savings we propose and explore several
low-complexity algorithms aimed at reducing the energy
consumption and show that very simple greedy heuristics
achieve 97% of the possible memory subsystem energy savings.
