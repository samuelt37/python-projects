Your computer must be able to access the internet to download these resources.
Clicking a resource will typically launch its own browser window for
  viewing/downloading (leaving this window underneath).
Downloads via the campus ethernet, DSL, and wireless connections are
  reasonably fast.
  

  Main Software: Clang C++ and CLion IDE 
Please follow the instructions below to download and install the following
  software packages, in the order given.
 
The final CLion instructions explain how to download, install, and test
  the course libraries ( courselib  and  gtestlib ), which are
  required for most quizzes and programming assignments.
  
I rewrote these instructions for Fall 2016.
If you find mistakes email them to me; if you are confused, post on the
  appropriate MessageBoard Forum.
