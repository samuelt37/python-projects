		This project investigates a new Internet architecture called
		Named Data Networking (NDN). NDN capitalizes on strengths -
		and addresses weaknesses - of the Internet's current
		host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in
		order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of
		communication. By naming data instead of their location, NDN
		transforms data into a first-class entity.
		
		   While the current
		Internet secures the data container (i.e., the communication channel), NDN secures the
		contents itself. Thanks to this design choice, trust in data is decoupled from
		trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable
		communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to
		optimize bandwidth. 
		
		  The project studies the technical
		challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a
		future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast
		forwarding, trust models, network security, content
		protection and privacy, and fundamental communication
		theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments,
		simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the
		proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and
		prototype implementations of NDN protocols and
		applications.
