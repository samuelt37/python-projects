I suggest:
1. Define a cartesian coordinate system.
2. Get the coordinates of the points.
3. Compute the mean: x=sum(x_i)/n,y=...
4. Compute the distances from (x,y) and call them r_i.
5. Compute the mean of r_i. 
6. Compute the variance of r_i. Call it s.
7. Now draw a circle around x,y with radius s.
It contains about 2/3 of the r_i values.
Radius 2s cointains about 90%,etc. Adjust the factor
before s to get experimentally about 90% of the points.

Happy fragging!

An additional point comes to mind as a result of a reply I got by E-mail. 
The target was evaluated for two parameters: the shift and the dispersion.
 Shift is measured from a laser boresight point and dispersion is *not*
measured from the boresight point, but rather from the center of the
smallest circle enclosing the 45 points.

Nice, assuming something like normal distribution.

    The problem is that the center of the smallest circle is
not necessarily the mean.

    I wonder whether the criterion is most effectively met
by the posted question.  If they want some % within a
certain-sized circle, then only THAT sized circle must be
considered.  Fix that radius as R.
    Calculate the mean, are enough holes within the circle of
radius R about that point.
    YES  =&gt; done.
    NO =&gt; what is nearest hole?  Does moving the circle to
cover that increase the number within circle?
    etc.  etc.
