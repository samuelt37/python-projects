Computing the Visibility Graph of Points Within a Polygon
 

  This is a presentation of the paper
"Computing the Visibility Graph of Points Within a Polygon,"
by Boaz Ben-Moshe, Olaf Hall-Holt, and Matthew J. Katz, and Joseph Mitchell,
 SCGÂ 2004 .

  
Abstract: The authors study the problem of computing the visibility
graph defined by a set  P  of  n  points inside a polygon
 Q : two points  p,q  in  P  are joined by an edge if
the segment  pq  is contained in  Q .

On finding a guard that sees most and a shop that sells most
 

 This is a presentation of the paper
"On Finding a Guard That Sees Most and a Shop That Sells Most,"
by Otfried Cheong, Alon Efrat, and Sariel Har-Peled,
 Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete
Algorithms . 

 Abstract: We present a near-quadratic time algorithm that computes
a point inside a simple polygon  P  having approximately the
largest visibility polygon inside  P , and near-linear time
algorithm for finding the point that will have approximately the
largest Voronoi region when added to an  n -point set. We apply
the same technique to find the translation that approximately
maximizes the area of intersection of two polygonal regions in
near-quadratic time.

  Due to time constraints I will be focusing on a few select results of
the paper.
