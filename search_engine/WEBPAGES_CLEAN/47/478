      Bren School 
    	        
	            
	           By establishing the University of California's first computer science school in 2002, UC Irvine made an investment in the future that reflects its historical commitment to raising the bar of excellence.
	            
	           
	            
	           The  Bren School  began as a department in 1968. More than 35 years later, it was formally recognized as a school – and in June 2004, we were renamed the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences in recognition of our benefactor’s generous contribution and for his visionary leadership.
	            
	           
	           
	            
	           As an independent school focused solely on the computer and information sciences, the Bren School has a unique perspective on the information technology disciplines, allowing us a broad foundation from which to build educational programs and research initiatives that explore the many applications of the computing discipline; from circuits and systems to software engineering and human aspects of computing.
	            
	           
	            
	           By blending research with education in multiple disciplines, the Bren School is leading interdisciplinary efforts in order to meet the challenges of the future.
