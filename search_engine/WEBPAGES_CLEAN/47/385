  Lesson 2 - Copyright 1:  
  Copyright In Cyberspace   
Consider the following situations: 
   You buy a piece of software and e-mail it to five friends. 
   You download an article from a newspaper's Web page and post in on an electronic bulletin board. 
   You take a post from one news group and forward it to another news group. 
   You respond to someone's discussion list post, and quote part of his post in yours  .
Each of these examples implicates copyright law.  In each of them there's at least a possibility that you'd be violating the law (though we'll find that in at least some of them you're probably safe). 
Copyright law  
   usually 
   gives a copyright owner the exclusive right to control      copying 
   of a writing (or recording or picture or electronic      transcription). 
   
In the next several messages, we'll explore each of these three elements. 
 A WORD OF WARNING:   Copyright law can be maddeningly vague, and copyright law online is doubly vague.  We´ll often say something "might"be legal, and you might often be frustrated by it.  But we have to be honest here - though copyright law is certain in some areas, it´s uncertain in others.  
Under these circumstances, "might makes right".
