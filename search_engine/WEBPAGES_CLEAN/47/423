 The Snowblower Problem 

 Technical report by Esther M. Arkin, Michael A. Bender, Joseph S. B.
Mitchell, and Valentin Polischuk 

 Presented by Keven A. Wortman 

 
Abstract:
  
We introduce the snowblower problem (SBP), a new optimization
problem that is closely related to milling problems and to some
material-handling problems.  The objective in the SBP is to compute a
short tour for the snowblower to follow to remove all the snow from a
domain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.).  When a snowblower passes over each
region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.  The
constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower
cannot clear the pile.
  
We give an algorithmic study of the SBP.  We show that in general, the
problem is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation
algorithms for removing snow under various assumptions about the operation
of the snowblower.  Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user
to control the direction in which the snow is thrown.  We differentiate
between the cases in which the snow can be thrown in any direction, in any
direction except backwards, and only to the right.  For all cases, we give
constant-factor approximation algorithms; the constants increase as the
throw direction becomes more restricted.
