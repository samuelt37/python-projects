 Compile 
 
We use cmake to generate makefiles. If you don't have it you can install it with:
 
 sudo apt-get install cmake
  
To compile the code for a module, generate the makefile with cmake and run make, as follows:
 
 cmake .
make
  
For example, let's say you extracted flamingo into the folder:
 
 /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src
  
Then if you want to build the filtertree module in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree do the following:
 
 cd /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree
cmake .
make
  
Please note that for the  mattree  module, there is no makefile provided, only a Visual C++ project file is provided. This module has not been compiled using GCC.
