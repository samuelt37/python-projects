    Algorithms for proximity problems in higher dimensions .  
M. T. Dickerson  and D. Eppstein.  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  5: 277–291, 1996 .
 
Combines a method from
" Provably good mesh generation " for
finding sparse high-dimensional Delaunay triangulations,
a method of Dickerson, Drysdale, and Sack
[" Simple
algorithms for enumerating interpoint distances ", IJCGA 1992]
for using Delaunay
triangulations to search for nearest neighbors,
and a method of Frederickson for speeding up tree-based searches.
The results are fast algorithms for several proximity problems
such as finding the  k  nearest neighbors to each point
in a given point set.

The Tech. Report used the more informative title
"Updating widths and maximum spanning trees using the rotating caliper graph",
which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the  rotating caliper
graph  of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

    Approximating center points with iterated Radon points .  
K. Clarkson , D. Eppstein, 
 G.L. Miller ,
 C. Sturtivant , and 
 S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  6 (3): 357–377, 1996 .
 
Given a collection of  n  sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
 linear programming ,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both  n  and  d.

 Approximation Algorithms for NP-hard Problems  ,
 D. Hochbaum , ed.,
PWS Publishing, 1996, pp. 296–345.

are known, and concentrates on bounds for worst-case approximation
ratios, especially those depending intrinsically on geometry
rather than on more general graph theoretic or metric space formulations.
Includes sections on the

Steiner trees,
 minimum weight triangulation ,
clustering, and separation problems.

    On triangulating three-dimensional polygons .  G. Barequet , 
 M. Dickerson ,
and D. Eppstein.  
 12th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Philadelphia, 1996, pp. 38–47 .  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  10: 155–170, 1998 .
 
It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Given a graph with edge weights that are linear functions of a parameter,
finds the sequence of
 minimum spanning trees  produced as the parameter varies,
in total time O(mn log n), by combining ideas
from " Sparsification "
and " Geometric lower bounds ".
Also solves various problems of optimizing the parameter value,
including one closely related to that in
" Choosing subsets with maximum weighted average ".

Improving on a recent breakthrough of Sharir,

of points in the Euclidean plane, in randomized expected time
O( n  log 2  n ).

D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 96-13 , ICS, UCI, 1996.  Inf. Proc. Lett.  62: 121–126, 1997.
 
Any algorithm that maintains the connected components
of a bitmap image must take Omega(log  n  / log log  n )
time per change to the image.  The problem can be solved in 
O(log  n ) time per change using dynamic planar graph techniques.
We discuss applications to computer Go and other games.

    On the parity of graph spanning tree numbers . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 96-14 , ICS, UCI, 1996.
 
Any bipartite Eulerian graph, any Eulerian graph with evenly many vertices,
and any bipartite graph with evenly many vertices and edges, has an even
number of
 spanning trees .
More generally, a graph has evenly many spanning trees if and only if it
has an Eulerian edge cut.

    Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 96-15 , ICS, UCI, 1996.  arXiv:cs.CG/9907031 .  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  23: 43–52, 2002 .
 
Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for  empirical
network analysis  and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n c ), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.
