  Tangencies 
 
The following set of nine circles requires five colors, if each pair 
of tangent circles must have distinct colors.  It is an
 open 
problem , posed by Ringel, whether five or any finite number of colors 
is always enough for any circle arrangement (having no triple tangencies).

   

 

 Ok, I admit it, these pages are merely an excuse for
me to try out  Cinderella ,
a nice multiplatform Java application by Kortenkamp and Richter-Gebert for 
setting up this sort of animation.  The black spots are anchor points, 
that you can drag around to produce different sets of circles with the 
same tangency pattern.

  But anyway, there is some interesting math involved in constructing the 
circles above:

  
  Inversion  
  Three Tangent Circles  
  Four Tangent Circles  
  Circular Angle Bisectors  
  Steiner's Porism  
  Apollonian Circles  
  Many Circles  
 

 See also  Paul
Kunkel's tangent circles page  for even more animated constructions.
