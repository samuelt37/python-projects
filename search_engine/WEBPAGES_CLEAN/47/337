        Translational Layer 

    	    What are translational layers? 
    		 
    			The translational layers are trusted software component which run
    			inside the client machine. They cointain the server specific implementation
    			that is required by the DataGuard middleware.
    		 
    		 
    			A simple translational layer contain the implementation of five functions.
    		 
    		  
    			public int connect(String username, String password);
    			public int disconnect();
    			public int store(AbstractObjectData O);
    			public int fetch(AbstractObjectData O);
    			public int delete(AbstractObjectData O);
    		  
    		 
    			The functions connect and disconnect open and close a session with
    			the Internet Data Provider. The funtction store(AbstractObjectData O) stores
    			an object O at the server and the function fetch(AbstractObjectData O)
    			retrieves the object from the server. The function delete(AbstractObjectData O)
    			deletes the object O stored at the server.
    		 
    	 

    	    RESCUE DB2 
    		 
    			The first translational layer has been built on top of a DB2 database.
    		 
    	 

    	    Gmail 
	    	 
	    		Probably everybody has a Gmail account, or more than one. So, why don't use
	    		all the storage space offered by Gmail?.
	    		This layer built a secure network file system on top of Gmail. Using
	    		this layer you will transform your Gmail account into a secure file storage
	    		space.
	    	 
    	 

    	    Amazon S3 
	    	 
	    		Amazon S3 is a storage for the Internet. It provides a simple web services
	    		interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at anytime,
	    		from anywhere on the web. Then, exactly what I need to build another secure
	    		network file system.
