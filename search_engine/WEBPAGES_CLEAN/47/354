 Complete partial orders (cpos) 



  Let P be an  ordered set . 
P is a  cpo  iff
for every pair x,y ∈ P,
their  LUB 
x ∨ y
is an elements of P. 
 

  Another way of saying the same thing: 
an ordered set P is a cpo
if it is  closed 
under the cup operation. 
 

  A cpo with a least element ⊥
is called a  cpo with bottom . 
Some authors use "cpo" to mean "cpo with bottom". 
 

  A cpo is sort of a "half-lattice" (see below). 
A lattice has LUBs and GLBs, a cpo has LUBs only. 
 

  Examples:
 
   Any powerset P, ordered by  ⊆  is a cpo. 
      Every powerset contains  ∅ ;
     ∅  ⊆ S for every subset S ∈ P,
    so  ∅  is a lower bound;
    and no other set is a lower bound for P, so
     ∅  is the GLB
    of the entire powerset P, and thus
     ∅  is
    ⊥. 
    See Figure 1. 
     
   

  Lattices 



  Let P be an  ordered set . 
P is a  lattice  iff
for every pair x,y ∈ P,
their
 LUB 
x ∨ y
and
 GLB 
x ∧ y
are both elements of P. 
 

  Another way of saying the same thing: 
an ordered set P is a lattice
if it is  closed 
under the cap and cup operations. 
 

  A lattice may have a top and/or a bottom,
but an infinite lattice need not have either. 
A finite lattice always has a top and a bottom. 
 

 Examples: 
 
  Any  powerset  P is a lattice. 
     
    The  LUB 
    ( GLB ) of two sets X and Y is
    their  union 
    ( intersection ),
    and a powerset is  closed 
    under intersection (union),
    so P is a lattice. 
    P is finite and thus has a top and a bottom;
    ⊤
    is the set S of which P is the powerset,
    and
    ⊥
    is the empty set  ∅ . 
    See  ordered set Figure 2 . 
     
   
   The integers are a lattice. 
     
    The LUB (GLB) of two integers x and y
    is the lesser (greater) of the two,
    and so is an integer;
    thus the integers are closed under LUB (GLB). 
    The integers are an infinite set
    and so need not have a top or a bottom,
    and in fact do not;
    there is no greatest or least integer. 
    See  ordered set Figure 1 .
