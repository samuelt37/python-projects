 Abstract 
 

 
Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types to the web search engines today. However, when
a person name is queried, the returned result often contains webpages related to several distinct namesakes who have
the queried name. The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person of interest is left
to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have been developed recently that attempt to automate this
disambiguation process. Nevertheless, the disambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major room for improvement. 
In this paper we describe our experience of applying our WePS approaches developed in [20] in the context of
WePS-2 Clustering Task [14]. The approach is based on extracting named entities from the web pages and then querying 
the web to collecting co-occurrence statistics, which are used as additional similarity measures.
