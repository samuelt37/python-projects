 Abstract 
  
   
In moving object environments it is infeasible for the database tracking the movement of objects to  
store the exact locations of objects at all times. Typically the location of an object is known with certainty  
only at the time of the update. The uncertainty in its location increases until the next update. In this  
environment, it is possible for queries to produce incorrect results based upon old data. However, if the  
degree of uncertainty is controlled, then the error of the answers to certain queries can be reduced. More  
generally, query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answer.  
In this paper we study the execution of such probabilistic, or imprecise, range and nearest-neighbor  
queries. The imprecision in queries is an inherent property of these applications due to uncertainty  
in the data, unlike the techniques for approximate nearest-neighbor processing that trade-off accuracy  
for performance. Algorithms for computing these queries are presented for a generic object movement  
model, and detailed solutions are discussed for two common models of uncertainty in moving object  
databases. Furthermore, we study approximate evaluation of these queries that allow a trade-off between  
execution time and accuracy. The use of indexes for efficient execution of approximate queries over large  
collections of moving objects is also presented.
