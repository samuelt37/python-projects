operator bool() const
    
This method is used to test for successful initialization of an
OEMCSSearch object.  If initialization was attempted with an invalid
SMARTS pattern or query molecule then this method will return false.
If initialization was completed successfully this method will return
true.  An instance of OEMCSSearch is considered to be uninitialized
when constructed with the default constructor.
