&gt;    I don't have a problem with this, except that we have HTTP PUT, and the
&gt; versioning stuff must work with it (to my mind, PUT is un-useful without
&gt; versioning, but that is (perhaps) only my problem). If we move all the
&gt; versioning stuff into a special content-type that must be processed,
&gt; versioning updates will be implemented differently from non-versioning
&gt; updates. This will reduce the ability of versioning to work with legacy
&gt; authoring environments, and _require_ special work for versioning to be
&gt; supported at all.

I don't think there are any legacy authoring environments that use PUT
without also using a bunch of non-standard stuff around it.
