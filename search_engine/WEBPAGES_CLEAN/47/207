    Appropriate Usage of TMBpro 
TMBpro assumes that the sequence is for a TMB protein. TMBpro does not contain
a screening component or predict the probability that a given protein really is
a TMB protein. It is a specialized predictor and not a general purpose tertiary structure predictor.
For any protein you submit, including globular, TMBpro will predict the secondary structure, contacts,
and then build a model utilizing available TMB templates. If the protein is not a TMB protein then
the model is destined to be wrong. To use TMBpro appropriately you should first have some evidence
that your sequence is a TMB protein.

 TMB Screening Methods 
A variety of methods have been developed for discriminating TMB from non-TMB proteins.
We have confirmed the following methods were functioning as of 11-24-2008:

  
 PRED-TMBB
