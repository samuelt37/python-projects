 Cats and Dogs Grammar in RSG Form

The original grammar in conventional form:
	S -&gt; NP VP
	NP -&gt; Art N
	Art -&gt; a | the
	N -&gt; cat | dog
	VP -&gt; V NP
	V -&gt; ate | chased | saw

We didn't address spaces in class;
here's the grammar with spaces explicit:
	S -&gt; NP SPACE VP
	NP -&gt; Art SPACE N
	Art -&gt; a | the
	N -&gt; cat | dog
	VP -&gt; V SPACE NP
	V -&gt; ate | chased | saw
	SPACE -&gt; \x20
(Hexadecimal 20 is the space character.  
So is \040 (the octal equivalent).)

{
[S]
[NP] [SPACE] [VP]
}

{
[NP]
[Art] [SPACE] [N]
}

{
[Art]
a
the
}

{
[N]
cat
dog
}

{
[VP]
[V] [SPACE] [NP]
}

{
[V]
ate
chased
saw
}

{
[SPACE]
\x20
}
You could also just insert \x20 literally
in all the places where [SPACE] occurs.
