 Inf295 -- Spring 2007<body>    Draft  June 7, 2007         INF 295: Privacy in Electronic    Environments             Instructor: Alfred Kobsa (  kobsa@uci.edu  )                 Disclaimer:</strong> These are guidelines intended    to help students plan their work in this course. However, the instructor    does reserve the right to make changes if needed.     General Educational Aims:    This class is concerned with "user    aspects" of privacy in electronic environments, specifically  web    sites,  ubiquitous computing environments and  collaborative environments.    It will     focus on empirical findings  regarding factors that influence individuals'    privacy-related decisions and actions (e.g., one's willingness to disclose    personal data to websites or one's proclivity to regard a call to one's cell    phone as a privacy invasion). To this aim, students will read research articles    that    were published    in different    disciplines,    such    as information    systems, marketing research, public policy, economics, computer-mediated    communication,  law, human-computer interaction, and the information and computer sciences.       Prerequisites : Informatics 231, 261 or 269, or permission of    instructor   Character of course :     Students will read and discuss research papers, write position statements,  and conduct a research project.    Location/Times :   TuTh 9:30-10:50 ICS 243   Grading:             30% for position statements             20% for paper presentations           20% for  active  in-classparticipation            30% for research project   Efficient reading : see  here   Cheating : see  here     Students with Disabilities:</strong> see  here    Add/drop :     Course Evaluation:</strong>  7pmFriday, June 1 through11:45pm Sunday, June 10   Office hours:  Alfred Kobsa: after class, or Tue 11am-12pm in 5092 Bren  Hall                        (contactme in class or send email beforehand)        Schedule     (changes possible) </strong>     : To download these papers, you will need to be within the UCIdomain  in most cases.
