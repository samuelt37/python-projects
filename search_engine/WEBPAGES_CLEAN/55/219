 Software Test Processes<body>
 
   Testing   :   
 
 affirms and sustains the integrity of the software system architectural 
configuration through 
 
       
     verifying the consistency and completeness of implemented modules,  
    
         
     verifying the resource interfaces and interconnections against their 
specifications, and  
    
         
     validating the performance of the system and subsystems against their 
requirements.  
    
         
     Software Testing processes include: 
    
 
     
     Unit test:    
   
     Structural path and control flow test :   
   
     Smoke (Build) test:     
   
     Regression test:   
   
     Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate and Release test:   
   
     Workload (capacity, performance, stress) test:     
   
     Configuration test:    
  
 
    
     Acceptance and certification benchmark test:    
   
     Perpetual test:
