     Merriam-Webster dictionary 
    gives
    American English definitions and
    pronunciation (with an audio clip);
    it's the most authoritative American English dictionary. 
   
   
     Oxford English Dictionary 
    (accessible from campus)
    gives
    very full and authoritative definitions,
    British pronunciation (in symbols only),
    and example uses from the past millennium or so;
    it is the most authoritative English dictionary
    but can be more cumbersome to use. 
   
    On this page,
    the  un derlined  syl lables
    are the ones that are stressed when you say the word.

        Ω  
       o me ga 
       Like  oh ,  may ; stress on  me 
       
      
It makes no sense to stress the  o  in
  o micron  ("little O")
but not in
 o me ga  ("big O"),
but there you are, that's what Americans seem to do. 
British pronunciation is at least consistent: 
 o mi cron 
(oh- my -kron). 
 

 
Words of Greek origin are often
 propar ox ytone ,
that is,
pronounced with the main stress
on the second-to-last syllable. 
Examples
(besides  proparoxytone  itself)
are
  an al yses  ,
  au to mata  ,
  cri te rion  ,
and
   sche mata  . 
 


 Other symbols and words that often cause problems 

  A b  
     Usually things like this are pronounced "A sub b". 
     

   A, a 
     If both cases appear in the same equation,
      it is common to hear people say "big A" and "A"
      (but usually not "little A" except for emphasis). 
     

   an al yses 
      Plural of  an al ysis . 
      One analysis, two analyses.  Pronounced
      "an-AL-is-eez".   
      Of Greek origin
      (thus the plural and the stress on the third-to-last syllable). 
     

   au to mata 
     The plural of  au to maton . 
      One automaton, two automata. 
      It is somewhat rare to see  automatons . 
      Of Greek origin
      ( α  υ  τ  ο  μ  α  τ  ο  ν ).
     

    ax es 
      Plural of   ax is . 
      One axis, two axes.  Pronounced "AX-eez". 
      Of Latin origin (but probably originally Greek). 
     

    com pl e ment 
      Sometimes confused with the related word "compl i ment". 
      Mathematical uses take "compl e ment" spelled with the 'e'. 
     

   corre spond  e nce 
      Sometimes confused with the related word "correspond a nce". 
      Mathematical uses take "correspond e nce" spelled with the 'e'. 
     

   cri te rion / cri te ria 
      One criterion, two criteria. 
      The OED mentions 'criterions' as 'uncommon' (it's very uncommon). 
      There is no such word as ' criterias '.
      Of Greek origin. 
     

   ex tre mum / ex tre ma 
      One extremum, two extrema. 
      It is rare to see  extremums .   
      Of Latin origin.
     

    ra tional vs. ratio nale  
      A number can be  ra tional
      (if it's the ratio of two integers); 
      a person can be  ra tional
      (if he or she is thinking logically and clearly),
      his or her argument can be  ra tional
      (if it's clear and logical),
      and a choice he or she makes
      can be  ra tional
      (if the argument in favor of that choice
      is clear, cogent, and more convincing
      than the arguments for the alternative choices. 
       
      However,
      the reasons for making a choice are its ratio nale . 
      Pronounced
       RA -shu-NAAL. 
      Rhymes with "pal" and "shall",
      but the "nale" syllable lasts a little longer. 
       
     

    sche mata 
     The plural of  schema 
      (although  schemas  is also common). 
      One schema, two schemata. 
      Of Greek origin ( σ  χ  η  μ  α ),
      thus the plural in  -ta 
      and the stress on the third-to-last syllable
        sche  ,
      like  au to maton  is also stressed on
      its third-to-last.
