 Interested in research? 
 Iâm always looking to do research with motivated undergrads and grad students.
If youâre interested in technology and the people that use it, send me an
email to schedule a meeting. 
       I am an assistant professor in the  School of Informatics and
Computing  at  Indiana University
Bloomington .  At IUB, I count myself lucky to be one
of the troublemakers in the  Human Computer Interaction
Design  (HCI/d) group.
I am also an affiliated faculty member in the  Institute of Software
Research  at the  University of California,
Irvine .  Before, I did a postdoc at  University College
Dublin , and my PhD at the  University of California,
Irvine . 

 I study our relationship with technology and how this relationship has and can
be changed. In particular, I work to understand how different subcultures have
reconciled themselves with our present age, an age where digital technology is
nearly inescapable. I believe we can learn a lot by studying, designing for,
or even  provoking  both mainstream cultures and niche communities.
Iâve studied a wide range of âusersâ: from corporate nomadic workers
and knowledge management practitioners to hardcore video gamers and Irish
traditional musicians. Most recently, I am investigating the confluence
between traditional/authentic practices and technology. 

 Academically, my interests lie in humanâcomputer interaction (HCI),
computerâsupported cooperative work (CSCW), ubiquitous computing,
organizational/management science, and science &amp; technology studies (STS).
Methodologically, I am an opportunistic researcher. I observe, interview,
critique, theorize, design, develop, and evaluate in my studies.

       News and Updates 
 February 2017: Two papers accepted at CHI, one on hunters with EunJeong and
another on website design with  Wen Chen  and
 David Crandall . Iâm also looking forward
to participating in the Virginia Tech  What Comes After CHI: Technology on the
Trail  workshop run by
 D. Scott McCrickard  and  Grace
Fields . 

 December 2016: Iâm very grateful to have received a gift from HP Labs via the
 Immersive Experiences
Lab .
The group there with Mirjana Spasojevic, Alex Thayer, and company are doing
some very really exciting, nuanced  stuff . 

 September 2016: EunJeong is on a role! A nuanced paper on how roboticists
conceive and predict the trajectory of their users will be presented at
CSCWâ17. 

 April 2016: A paper with  Erik  addressing
authenticity and technology via the dour Kierkegaard to be presented at DIS
2016! Iâm also happy to have worked with my wonderful PhD student, EunJeong
Cheon, on an Alt.HRI paper arguing why we need to think about and question the
ingrained values of roboticists. 

 November 2015: A nice article spearheaded with Pascale, MiloÅ¡, Bonnie, and
Hamid on the ethics of self-driving vehicles has appeared in
 ISTAS . 

 March 2015: The fantastic  Lulu Wang  and I
have a CHI paper on the transformative role of mobiles in our conversations at
Irish pubs. 

 October 2014:  Ashley Tan 
presented a nice paper at DTRS we wrote with
 Eli  on the rhetoric of industrial
design and its relation to sustainability. 

 June 2014: A fun paper with  Leslie S. Liu 
and  Amanda Lazar  at UW analyzing the
discourse of healthcare robots has been accepted to NordiCHI. 

 May 2014: My DIS paper on TuneTracker with  Bryan
Duggan  at DIT won honorable mention! 

 August 2013: Iâm really excited to announce  TuneTracker , a
software system that discerns the changing repertoire of an Irish traditional
music (âjamâ) session. Itâs running in  The
Cobblestone  pub. 

 April 2013: Paper on traditional musicians to be
 published  in ECSCW
