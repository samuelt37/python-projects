 Scheme References  
  
 The following references to Scheme are available
on-line.  For ICS 22, please consider these optional; you can do what you
need to do in the lab based on what we covered in class (and some serious
thinking to work through the concepts for yourself), and all of these contain
much more detail than we will need for our brief coverage this quarter.  
  
  Schemers, Inc. 
( www.schemers.com ) makes EdScheme
and other products for teaching Scheme.  Their comprehensive Web site points
to all the major Scheme resources on the net.  
   
  The Programming Languages Team 
at Rice University also produces a wide set of Scheme materials, including
a  textbook draft 
(available at     http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Teaching/Lectures/Released/curriculum/    )
and the free  Dr. Scheme programming environment ,
which is available for all major platforms.  We expect that the Scheme work
we do in ICS 22 will be compatible with Dr. Scheme, but as always we can't
make any guarantees.
