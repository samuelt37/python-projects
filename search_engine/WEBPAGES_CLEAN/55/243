                    Melissa Mazmanian  is an Associate Professor in the Department of Informatics at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Melissa’s interests revolve around communication practices in personal and organizational contexts, specifically in relation to social norms and the nature of personal and professional time in the digital age. She is currently involved in conducting ethnographies of personal time, looking at the role of communication theologies in how families juggle busy lives and negotiate work and personal demands. In addition, Melissa is interested in the intersection between formal power structures and everyday practices in organizations. In this vein she has been engaged in qualitative research on practices of budgeting, the introduction of electronic health systems, change efforts to promote predictable time off, and smartphone use in work contexts. Melissa has published in Organization Science, Academy of Management Journal, MIS Quarterly and ACM venues such as CHI and CSCW. She earned her PhD in Organization Studies from the MIT Sloan School of Management and  Masters in Information Economics, Management and Policy from the University of Michigan, School of Information.
