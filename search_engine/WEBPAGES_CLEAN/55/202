            Easter Song    
        
           
               Yesterday, I put together a simple song for Easter.  Here are the lyrics:   You came, You died And on the third day You rose again You're alive, You're alive You offer us eternal life  We were lost in all our sin But you rescued us, gave a second chance So we give thanks   Copyright 2006 Arthur Asuncion    Listen to the  MP3 acoustic recording  (3.7 MB)

            A Story Of Forgiveness    
        
           
               Here's a  story  of a 5-year old girl who forgave a man that paralyzed her with a stray bullet. What a great model of forgiveness! Let's also remember God's ultimate demonstration of forgiveness during Easter. Through Christ's death on the cross and resurrection, we have forgiveness of sin and the hope of heaven! You can learn how to have  peace with God .
