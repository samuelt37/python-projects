 Features of the ADL<body>

  Features of the ADL  
      The ADL has two major components:
 
  Description of the structure of the architecture.
   The individual components that make up the architecture
  datapath units, storage units, connections and ports.
     The connectivity between these components
   Memory hierarchy
    Description of the instruction-set of the architecture.
   Syntax and Semantics of the operations
   Constraints on parallelism between operations
   Information needed by the optimizations.
         Unlike previous ADLs ours tightly integrates the structural and instruction-set descriptions, reducing complexity and improving readability/usability.
