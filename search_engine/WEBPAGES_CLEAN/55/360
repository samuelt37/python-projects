  Lesson 44 - Free Speech 5:  
  Government as Sovereign and 
Fully Protected Speech, Part I      

If speech is fully protected, and the government is acting as sovereign, then the main remaining question is whether the government is regulating speech *because of its content*.  
If the restriction is content-based then it's almost certainly unconstitutional.  For instance,  
   A ban on newsgroup posts that express bigoted viewpoints would be unconstitutional: Reprehensible as bigoted ideas are, they are constitutionally protected.   A ban on Web pages that discuss abortion would be unconstitutional.  This is so even though the ban applies to all views (both pro and anti) on abortion.  Even such "viewpoint- neutral" regulations are presumptively unconstitutional, so long as they are *content*-based.   
And this is true regardless of whether the restriction is enforced through *criminal punishment* or through *civil liability*.  A law that lets people sue for emotional harm inflicted by bigoted Web sites would be as unconstitutional as a law imposing criminal punishment on people who put up such sites. 
If the restriction is content-neutral -- for instance, a tax of 1/100 of a cent per 1000 bytes of e- mail sent, or a ban on any person sending more than 100 unsolicited e-mail messages a day -- it's probably constitutional, even though it does in some way restrict speech.  
Common MYTH:  "Content-based speech restrictions are OK if they only restrict the time, place, or manner of speech." No; if a restriction is content-based, it's presumptively unconstitutional, even if it lets you express your views some other way or in some other place or at some other time. Thus, a law banning profanity on all newsgroups is unconstitutional even though it only restricts the "manner" and "place" of expression and doesn't itself ban any ideas.
