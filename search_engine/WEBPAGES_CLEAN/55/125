  Static or Fixed Routing 

     

  Note : Understanding of IP routing prior to your laboratory session
is essential for this week�s experiments. 

 Cisco has some useful info on
their website on routing.

 1.1         
 Static Routing 

     

 Every routing decision is made by
the routing table look-up. The routing table can be updated by a routing daemon
(dynamic routing), ICMP redirect message, or the command that manipulates
routing table entries (static routing). 

     

 A static route is one that you
enter explicitly using commands. To build the routing table in your PC, the
route command is used. Routing entries that are created manually don�t usually
change, even if you run a routing daemon. Static routes are often added from
the system startup script. 

     

  Routing table for PC    

     

 Your PC�s routing table can be
displayed with the  netstat  command.
We list the commands that are used to manually build the routing table in your
PC. 

     

  netstat -rn  : displays the routing table in the system. 

  route add -net  
destination_net_address    netmask    mask    gw    gateway_address: 
adds a new route to the routing table via a particular gateway, specifies the
mask to be used for this entry. ( -host  will enter a host entry and one
does not specify a netmask �  for that.) 

  route del �net  
destination_net_address : deletes an existing route from the routing table 

     

 All the arguments are
self-explanatory. For more details see the  man 
pages. 

     

  Routing table for Router    

     

 You can manually configure the
router�s table. In order to see the IP routing table in the router, in the
privileged-level mode, type the following command: 

     

   �����������  router_name# show ip
route    

     

 The following commands are used
to modify the routing table entries in the router. Type the following commands
in the configuration mode. Read last lab�s �Configuring Router� section on how
to get into the configuration mode. 

     

  ip route   destination_address
netmask router_address  : creates a route to  destination_address  via  router_address .
The argument  destination_address  is
the IP address of the  target  network, and the argument  router_address  is the address of a
router that can reach  destination_address 
. The  mask  gives the mask to be used
for the destination address. 

     

  no ip route   destination_address
router_address  : removes a route from the IP routing table. 

 1.1.1        
 A Single Router Experiment 

 For this experiment we will only
be using a single router and two PCs connected via hubs to the router
interfaces. Use the table below to set the IP addresses for the two PCs and the
router. Note that because we are using a router, each interface has a different
IP net address (compare to the bridge setup). 

     

  
     
      
      
       �����������������������

  Table 3.1: IP addresses for Figure
3.1    

     

 Use setup from the console window
to configure the router. If you disable bridging, ip routing is enabled. Do not
enable any of the routing algorithms as we are using static routing and will be
entering the routes manually! If you use the configure command instead to set
up the router, you must enable routing by typing 

     

  ip routing    

       

 at the configure command.. As the
router is directly connected to the only two subnets  no  manipulation of
the router�s routing table is required at this point. Use the command: 

     

  show ip
route     

       

 at the enable prompt to display the routing table. 

 Next you must setup the PC
routing tables. As �  they are both connected
to an Ethernet to which only one router is attached, we can use the default
entry to route all traffic not local to its subnet via the router. First check
your PC routing tables using the  netstat �rn  or  route  commands.
Then use the command: 

     

  route add �net 
 0   gw   154.81.51.1  

     

 on Host_A and the command: 

     

  route add
�net   default   gw   154.81.52.1  

     

 on Host_B.  

 Now use the command  netstat �rn  or  route  on
both PCs to check your routing tables. The � 0 � destination net address
used in the command above reflects the  default  route (one can also type  default ).
For default route you do not give any netmask. Note that the position of a
routing entry indicates its search order. Whenever an IP device needs to route
an IP datagram, it uses the routing table and searches thru it systematically
starting with the first entry.  

     

   Exercise 1   ������   

 Run  tethereal �V  on your machine, and  tethereal �V  on the other machine in the other subnet at the same
time. Send  ping  messages to the
other machine .  After receiving the
tenth echo reply, quit the  ping 
process and save the  tethereal  outputs
for both machines. 

         

   Questions #1:   �   

  �        
  When a packet is sent to a PC in the other subnet,
explain how the source and destination Ethernet addresses are changed. 

  �        
  What are the source and destination addresses in the IP
and Ethernet headers of a packet that goes from your machine to the router?  

  �        
  What are the source and destination addresses in the IP
and Ethernet headers of a packet that goes from the router to the other
machine? 

  �        
  Answer the same questions, but for the echo reply that
is returned from the other machine. 

  �        
  Show the routing tables for both PCs. 

     

   Exercise 2:     

 Add to Host_A�s routing table the
following entry: 

     

  route add
�net   154.81.52.0   netmask   255.255.255.0   gw  
154.81.51.1  

     

 Now check the routing table using
 netstat �rn  or  route (-e  will give same output as  netstat �rn  and 
�ee  will give everything!). 

     

   Questions #2 :    

  Compare the two routing tables, prior to and after
     the route addition. 
  Will this new entry make a difference? Explain what
     happened to the routing table. 
  Explain the flags associated with the entries in the
     routing table. 
  If you added a host entry for Host B instead, what
     would it look like in the routing table? Explain the associated flags and
     its position in the table. 
  1.1.2        
 A 4 Subnet Experiment 

 In this experiment, we divide the
network into four subnets. There will be one machine in each of the following
subnets, 154.81.51.0, 154.81.52.0, 154.81.53.0 and 154.81.54.0. As shown in
figure 3.2, we will connect the four subnets (154.81.51.0, 154.81.52.0, 154.81.53.0,
and 154.81.54.0) using three routers. 

     

 In order to configure the new
network topology, we need to change the current IP addresses of each PC
interface card. The new IP addresses that we want to use are as shown in the
figure. (Note that 52.100 is an abbreviation for 154.81.52.100. This notation
applies to all the PC and router addresses given in the figure above.) 

     

     

     

     

     

        

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

       

       

       

       

   Figure 3.2: Topology for static
routing    

     

  �����������   

     

   Exercise 3   ������   

 Change the IP addresses of the
PCs to reflect the network configuration as shown in figure 3.1. Also configure
the routers. Save the output of  netstat
-rn  or  route �ee  before building the PCs� routing tables. After
examining figure 3.2, build the static routing table in all the PCs manually.
Use  netstat �rn  or  route �ee  to verify your entries. 

     

 Save the routing tables of all the routers before
building any routes. Note: You cannot telnet into the routers as they are on
different subnets and the routing tables have not yet been entered. You need to
use the console to configure each router. 

     

 Now configure the routing table
in each router using the  ip route  command (e.g.,  ip route   154.81.51.0
255.255.255.0 154.81.52.1  will add the �51� subnet address to router 2�s
table indicating that the router with port address 154.81.52.1 must be used as
the next hop router). Note, as mentioned above, you must set  ip routing .
Recall that we set it to  no ip routing  to do bridging in last week�s
experiment. 

     

 Use the  ping  and  traceroute 
programs to test the connections. Save the  traceroute  outputs. 

     

 When you can reach other hosts successfully, save the
routing tables of all the PCs and in the routers for the lab report. (Even if
the routing table in your PC is correct and all the routers are configured
perfectly, you may not get the connection to one of the other PCs. If this is
the case, the routing table in the other PC should be blamed. When you can get
the ping reply messages from all the interfaces in the PCs and routers
successfully, your work is done for this exercise on static routing.) 

     

   Questions #3  : �   

  Submit what you saved in Exercise 3. 
  Explain the  netstat -rn  outputs (i.e., the PCs
     routing tables after configuration). Your explanation should include the
     meanings of the flags that appeared, and the routing function of each
     entry.

 1.2         
 Experiments with ICMP and Routing 

     

 Use the same network configuration
as you did for the Static Routing experiment (Figure 3.2)  

     

   Exercise 4:     

 Empty the routing table of PC
154.81.52.100 by typing:  route flush . Then add a default routing entry
to gateway 154.81.51.1. Check the routing table by typing:  netstat �rn .
Save the contents. Run  tethereal  in a window on PC 154.81.52.100. Then  ping 
from PC 154.81.52.100 to PC 154.81.53.100. Immediately after  ping 
returns with �an alive� message check the routing table. Save the contents.
Wait a few minutes then check the contents of the routing table again and save.
Also save the  tethereal  output. 

     

   Questions #4:     

  Compare the contents of the three  netstat 
     outputs. What do you observe? Discuss the different entries and the
     corresponding flags. 
  Analyze the  tethereal  output and explain what
     happens using the content of the  tethereal  file. 
  1.3         
 Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 

  �����������  Although
there are many routing protocols, we will study one of the most common ones
that is used for intra Autonomous System routing (Interior Gateway Protocols),
the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). RIP is run by the routing daemon,  routed , in your PC. The routing daemon
dynamically builds the routing table from the received RIP updates. The PCs
started  routed  at boot-up, no other
action is needed to run RIP on the PCs. (Note: if you make any manual changes
to the routing table (adds or deletes),  routed  will not touch manual
changes. For example, if you accidentally delete an entry in the PC routing
table,  routed  will not re-insert it. You have to kill the routed process
(use:  ps �ef �  | grep routed  to
get the process ID, then  kill   process   (  process    here
refers to the process ID), and then restart it using:  in.routed �q ). 

     

 To enable a routing process for
RIP on all interfaces in a router, use the following commands when in
configuration mode. Refer to the �Configuring Router� section on how to get
into configuration mode. 

     

  �����������   router rip    

   �����������  network   network_number  

     

  network_number  �  is
154.81.0.0 for this network configuration. 

     

 To remove a network from the
list: 

     

  �����������   no network   network_number  

     

 To shut down the routing process: 

     

  �����������   no router rip  

     

  Note again that
any routes that were added manually will not be updated by RIP.    

         

         

   Exercise 5     

  �����������   

 Empty all the routing tables in
the PCs and the routers. Use Figure 3.2 again as the network configuration. Now
start the RIP process in the routers. 

     

 After running RIP in all the
routers, test the connections to the other hosts using either  traceroute 
or  ping . Once you can successfully reach all the hosts, save one of the
RIP messages using  tethereal �P udp -V 
in each subnet. Save the routing table in one of the PCs. 

     

   Questions #5  : �   

     

  �        
  Draw the format of the saved RIP response packet from
one of the subnets, include the IP and UDP headers and the RIP message (see Figure
5.11 in the textbook). Identify each field and express the numbers in decimal
form.  

  �        
  Are the RIP packets propagated over the routers? 

  �        
  Show the contents of the routing table of one of the
PCs after starting RIP. 

     

  

    
     
     
        

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

   Figure 3.3: Rip Experiment    

       

       

       

       

   Exercise 6     

  �����������   

 Now connect the fourth router as
show in Figure 3.3. Use  netstat �rn  or  route �e  to observe the
changes that are being made to the routing tables. Save the output. Now disconnect
the two cables that connect router 4 to the two Ethernets. See approx. how much
time it takes RIP to alter the routing table in PC 52.100 to reflect the new
topology. (Hint: use  ping �s  from PC 154.81.52.100 to PC 154.81.54.100
and see how long it takes till the alive message comes thru again after the
disconnection. Check the routing table for new entries!) 

     

   Questions #6  : �   

     

  �        
  Give the measured time from Exercise 6. 

  �        
  Compare the entries of the routing tables in the PCs
and the routers with router4 connected and disconnected. 

     

 1.4         
 Mixed Router � Bridge Experiment 

     

 For this experiment you will configure two of the routers as
bridges and two as routers as shown in Figure 3.4 below. 

     

  

    
     
     
        

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

     

  Figure 3.4 Router � Bridge Experiment 

     

 Four PCs are connected to 4 LANs (one PC per LAN). Two bridges �  and two routers are interconnecting the 4
LANs. This a type �B� campus network and the network ID is: 132.143. �   

     

     

   Exercise 7     

     

 Flush all the routing tables and run RIP. Only three bits
may be used for subnetting. Choose appropriate subnet IDs for the given configuration.
Assign IP addresses to the bridge and router interfaces and the 4 PCs. 

     

   Questions #7  : 

     

  What
     is the subnet mask for this subnetted network?  
  For
     each IP address that you assigned, identify the subnet ID and the host ID. 
      

   Exercise 8     

     

 After RIP has run for awhile and you are able to reach all 4
PCs (use  ping  or  traceroute ), use  netstat �  -rn  or  route -e  to show the
routing tables in the PCs. Save the outputs. While running  tethereal �V  on
PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4,  telnet  from PC1 to PC3. Observe the packet flow
between the two PCs. 

     

   Questions #8  : 

     

  Give
     the routing tables of the 4 PCs. 
  Trace
     the flow of IP packets from PC1 to PC3. 
  Indicate
     the Ethernet and IP packet headers used on each LAN segment for the IP packets
     flowing between PC1 and PC3.
