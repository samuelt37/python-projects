 Abstract  
This paper evaluates the power of a new scheme that generates search heuristics
mechanically. This approach was presented and evaluated first in the context of optimization 
in belief networks. In this paper we extend this work to Max-CSP. The
approach involves extracting heuristics from a parameterized approximation scheme
called Mini-Bucket elimination that allows controlled trade-of between computa-
tion and accuracy. The heuristics are used to guide Branch-and-Bound and Best First
 search, whose performance are compared on a number of constraint problems.
Our results demonstrate that both search schemes exploit the heuristics effectively,
permitting controlled trade-off between preprocessing (for heuristic generation) and
search.
