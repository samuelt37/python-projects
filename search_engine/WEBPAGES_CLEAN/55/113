     Contribute to the SimSE Code Base  

   SimSE is open source, and we gladly invite anyone to make their own modifications. If you are just interested in browsing the source without checking it out,
   you can  browse the raw source archive  or you can use the somewhat friendlier  Trac On-Line Source Browser . 
     
    Alternatively, if you would like to download the actual source files, use your favorite configuration management system (we recommend  TortoiseSVN ) to check out the code from the following URL:  
   
     http://tps.ics.uci.edu/svn/projects/simse/trunk/simse/src 
        

      To contribute your own modified version of SimSE, please  let us know , and we will add it to the  SimSE Subversion Repository .    

          

   

    

      Contribute a Model 

      We also strongly encourage the building of many different types of models. If you have built a model, please  let us know  and we will add it to the  SimSE Models Subversion Repository  .   

       

        

       SimSE is funded by  NSF grant number DUE-0618869.
