" Toward Metrics for Process Validation " ,
by Jonathan E. Cook and Alexander L. Wolf
in  Proceedings of the Third International Conference on the Software Process
(ICSP3) , pages 33-44, Reston, VA, October 1994.

  Abstract  

To a great extent, the usefulness of a formal model of a software process
lies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of the executing
process.  Similarly, the usefulness of an executing process lies largely in
its ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the
process.  When process models and process executions diverge, something
significant is happening.  We are developing techniques for uncovering
discrepancies between models and executions under the rubric of "process
validation".  Further, we are developing metrics for process validation
that give engineers a feel for the severity of the discrepancy.  We
view the metrics presented here as a first step toward a suite of useful
metrics for process validation.
