   Other uncertainty modeling techniques  
 
In this dissertation, we have used Bayesian networks
to model uncertainty in software development.
Alternative approaches to uncertainty modeling and
logical inference exist, however, that must be weighed
and compared against Bayesian methods.  Those include
Certainty-Factor approaches, Dempster-Shafer approaches,
fuzzy logic, and default, monotonic, and nonmonotonic
logicÂ [ Ste95 ].  Specifically, relative merits
and pitfalls of these techniques should be evaluated
against the Bayesian
approach in the context of software engineering situations.
