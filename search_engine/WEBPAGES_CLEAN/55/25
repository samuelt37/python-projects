			 Computational Geometry: An Introduction through Randomized Algorithms 

			 
				  Ketan Mulmuley   Prentice Hall ,  1994  

				 Cites: 
				   Dynamic three-dimensional linear programming  
				  Also cites "Hidden surface removal for rectangles" attributed to Bern, Dobkin, and Eppstein, but in context this seems to be one of Marshall's papers rather than visibility w/a moving point of view.
