  CGAL::Real_timer  
 

  Definition 
 

 #include &lt; CGAL/Real_timer.h &gt; 
  

The class   Real_timer   is a timer class for measuring real time.
A timer  t  of type   Real_timer   is an object with a state. It is
either  running  or it is  stopped . The state is controlled
with  t.start()  and  t.stop() . The timer counts the
time elapsed since its creation or last reset. It counts only the time
where it is in the running state. The time information is given in seconds.
The timer counts also the number of intervals it was running, i.e. it 
counts the number of calls of the  start()  member function since the 
last reset. If the reset occures while the timer is running it counts as the
first interval.
  

  Creation 
 

    
          Real_timer  t;
         
              
    state is  stopped. 
 

     

  Operations 
 

    
           
void
         
          
         
    t.start ()
         
            Precondition:  state is  stopped .
            
           
void
         
          
         
    t.stop ()
         
            Precondition:  state is  running .
            
           
void
         
          
         
    t.reset ()
         
          
    reset timer to zero. The state is unaffected.
            
           
bool
         
          
         
    t.is_running ()
         
          
     true  if the current state is running.
                 
           
double
         
          
         
    t.time ()
         
          
    real time in seconds, or 0 if the 
                            underlying system call failed.
            
           
int
         
          
         
    t.intervals ()
         
          
    number of start/stop-intervals since
                                 the last reset.
            
           
double
         
          
         
    t.precision ()
         
          
    smallest possible time step in seconds,
                                 or -1 if the system call failed.
            
           
double
         
          
         
    t. max  ()
         
          
    maximal representable time in seconds.
            

  Implementation 
 

The timer class is based in the C function  gettimeofday()  on
POSIX systems, the C function  _ftime()  on MS Visual C++,
the C function  ftime()  on Borland C++, and  time() 
on Metrowerks Codewarrior. The system calls to these
timers might fail, in which case a warning message will be issued
through the C GAL  error handler and the functions return with the
error codes indicated above.  The  precision  method computes the
precision dynamically at runtime at its first invocation.
