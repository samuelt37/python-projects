&gt;If Web tools were made "configuration smart" in addition to "version
&gt;smart", then rather than pass around version identifiers, they might
&gt;instead pass around release or configuration identifiers, which the
&gt;server might then resolve to a particular version of a given URL.
&gt;(Note that I'm not just referring to version tags here, but rather some
&gt;indicator of the release/configuration that implies not just the
&gt;specific version of each URL, but also the actual set and structure
&gt;of the URLs.  For example, configuration "release 3.0" might have
&gt;one set and structure of URLs, but "release 4.0" might have a
&gt;completely different set and structure.)

The notion of volume identifiers has been kicked around in the
HTTP caching subgroup. It might relate.
