 Validating Adaptation<body>

  Validating Adaptation  
      Idea: Exploit additional hardware (unused gates) for additional redundancy and validation
 
  Increases system reliability without major resource cost
  High Level generation of Validation circuits; invariants, complements, etc. (automatic and manual)
  Wide range of redundancy possible, validation can be partial to multiple in time and versions
  Can detect and signal errors or failures
  
  =&gt; May be the only approach possible for dynamic adaptation
