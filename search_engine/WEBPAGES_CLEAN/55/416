 Fanorona 

   

  I wrote this after the fact as a demo for my  
class on board game programming . A  
standalone Macintosh application version  and the  source code  are also available. 

  

 Here's  another
Java Fanorona game  (without computer-play features),  Fanorona for GNOME , a  play-by-email
server ,  a description
of the game from the Knights of the Square Table ,
 another
description of the game (in Italiano) ,
and
 a
web site from Madagascar (in French) .
