 ICS 163, Spring 2010: 
Graph Algorithms 

  General Course Information 

 Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final exam. Group work on homeworks is permitted;
each student should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks.
Recommended (but not required) course texts will be  Network Flows 
(Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin) and  Graph Drawing  (Di Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and
Tollis). The course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, 2:00 - 2:50,
in Bren Hall, room 1300. My office hours will be Mondays and Tuesdays
3:00 - 3:50, in Bren Hall, room 4214, or by appointment.

  The final grade will be formed by combining the numerical scores from
the homeworks (20%), midterm (35%), and final (45%). The reader is Liyan
Zhang.
