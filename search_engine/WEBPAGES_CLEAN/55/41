 Postfix notation  is an unambiguous 
way of writing an arithmetic expression without parentheses.
It is defined so that if 
  
 exp1   op   exp2 
 
is a normal fully-parenthesized expression whose operation is
 op , then the postfix version of this is 
 
 pexp1   pexp2   op 
 
where
 pexp1  is the postfix version of  exp1  and
 pexp2  is the postfix version of  exp2 .
The postfix version of a single number is just that number.
So, for example, the postfix version of 
 
((5+2)*(8-3))^4 
 
is 
 
5 2 + 8 3 - * 4 ^
 
Write a Java program that evaluates an expression 
that is input in postfix notation.
Your program should support numbers input as integers or (floating
point) doubles, and it should support the following operators:
  
+, for addition
   -, for subtraction
   *, for multiplication
   /, for division
   ^, for exponentiation (the power function)
  
Note: you may use the following classes in your program:
    
java.lang.Math 
    
java.util.Stack 
    
java.util.Scanner 
  
You may  not  use any built-in program for exponentiation by an
integer, however.  You must write the code for this operator
yourself, using the fast exponentiation algorithm given in class.
You should read expressions from System.in and output to System.out.
