3.28.1 SetExpr 
 
   
virtual bool SetExpr(OEExprBase *expr)
    
This pure virtual method defines the interface for storage of an
expression.  The parent class instance takes ownership of the memory
associated with the expression pointer.  Any existing expressions
stored in the parent instance will be destroyed.  Stored expressions
are destroyed along with their parent OEQBase instance.
