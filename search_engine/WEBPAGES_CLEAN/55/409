Create_Tree(Examples)
   
	If all of the examples belong to the same class
  
		Then Return a leaf node with that class as a label
  
		Else	Attribute = SelectAnAttribute(Examples)
  
			Node = CreateTestNode(Attribute)
  
			For each Value of that attribute
  
			    Partition = Subset of examples with the attribute value
  
			    Subtree = Create_tree(Partition)
  
			    Attach(Subtree, Node, Value)
  
			Return Node
