 Epsilon-cutset effect in Bayesian networks
of arbitrary topology 

 Bozhena Bidyuk, Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper investigates the behavior of iterative belief propagation
algorithm (IBP) in Bayesian networks with loops. In multiply connected 
network, IBP is only guaranteed to converge in linear
time to the correct posterior marginals when evidence nodes form
a loop-cutset. We propose an e-cutset criteria that IBP will converge 
and compute posterior marginals close to correct when a
single value in the domain of each loop-cutset node receives very
strong support compared to other values thus producing an effect
similar to the observed loop-cutset. We investigate the support for
this criteria analytically and empirically and show thatit is consistent 
with previous observations of IBP performance in multiply connected networks.
