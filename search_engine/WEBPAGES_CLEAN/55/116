				 Catalogue Description  
				209S Seminar in Informatics (2). Current research and research trends 
				in Informatics. Forum for presentation and criticism by students of 
				research work in progress. May be repeated for credit. Formerly ICS 229.
				  
				 Course Structure  
				This particular incarnation of 
				the seminar will focus on ideas.  Specifically, each week everyone 
				is expected to bring to the table a new idea that pertains to 
				Informatics research.  Each week, we will hear brief synopses of 
				all ideas and choose one or two for extensive discussion.  The goal 
				is to hone our abilities to critically examine ideas, to learn to be 
				supportive even if we are skeptical, to gain an understanding of what 
				we consider good and bad research ideas, and to illustrate the role 
				of a group in furthering ideas.
				  
				 Attendance  
				All students are expected to attend all seminars (attendance will be
				taken).  During the first hour of our weekly meeting we will proceed 
				per the above.  During the second hour we will join the rest of the 
				Informatics Department in the Friday Research Hour.  That hour will 
				be devoted to faculty research talks, open discussions, panels, and 
				other activities still to be determined.
				  
				 Grades  
				All students enrolled in the course will earn a grade based upon: (a) 
				a weekly one-page write-up of their idea, (b) class attendance, and (c) 
				class participation.

				impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her 
				specific needs.  Also contact the Disability Services Center at
