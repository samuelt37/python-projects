Something that some people may find useful;  Asymptotic Notation (O, o, Omega, Theta...)  ( PDF )  

This is a schedule for Fall quarter 2006, updated on September 21, 2006. 
If there are any breaks, this schedule will not be accurate.     Key:        Classes, since I don't skip classes, I will be in them, and you will not be able to get ahold of me (I turn off my cell phone).      Office time, during these times I will likely be in my office; Computer Science 1, suite 358E.  Either that or running errands, maybe getting food or something.      Otherwise, I will most likely be at home or in transit.  If you are a student in one of my discussion sections, I am available for appointment during these hours.  To make an appointment, email me at least a day in advance.  My contact information is available  here .      If the block of time is red, I am BUSY, that is, I will not be available for appointment.      Each entry lists a course name on the first line and the location on the last line.  If you would like building definitions, head  here .  If you would like the campus map (pdf), head  here .     

If you cannot make my office hours, email me to schedule an appointment.
