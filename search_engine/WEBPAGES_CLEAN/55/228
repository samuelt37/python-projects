       Course Overview 
        
           The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic principles of Artificial Intelligence. 
           Topics covered Include: Heuristic search, Adversarial search, Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Knowledge representation, Reasoning and Planning.
           We will cover much of the content of chapters 1-14 in the course book.

        
         
       Assignments: 
        
           There will be weekly homework-assignments, a project, and a final.

        
         
       Course-Grade: 
        
           Homeworks will account for 20% of the grade, project 30% of the grade, final 50% of the grade.

        
         

       Project 
        
           You will be required to do a project. This includes submitting a written report at the end of the quarter. 
           Due to the large number of students enrolled, each project will be a team project (2-3 stundents per team).
