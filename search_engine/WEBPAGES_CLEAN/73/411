This follows on to our previous paper on
 using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip  by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

Considers heuristic modifications to the tree-cotree decomposition of my
earlier paper  Dynamic generators of
topologically embedded graphs , to make the set of fundamental cycles
found as part of the decomposition follow the contours of a given
geometric model.
