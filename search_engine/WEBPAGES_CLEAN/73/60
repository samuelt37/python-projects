 David Eppstein Bibliography Files<body>
 Bibliography Files 

   The following bibliographies are all in BibTeX format. Although
they were primarily collected to be used for my own papers (as
indicated by the "related publications" pointers), I have updated
them by performing literature searches in popular databases and
included many references beyond the ones I cited myself. See the
"related publications" pointers for more detailed descriptions of
the bibliographies' subjects. 

 I am currently in the process of converting these databases to
 BibGene , a free BibTeX-compatible
bibliographic database program for the Macintosh. Converted files
(indicated by the availability of a BibGene version) should be much
cleaner than my original hand-edited BibTeX sources. 

   My own publications:   HTML-ized
BibTeX  ().  Unmangled BibTeX  (
). Extracted from a larger  BibGene file  ().

I'm also making available here two BibTeX style files (last updated
): 
   Abbreviated style with URLs:   
abuser.bst  ().   

  Unsorted abbreviated style with URLs:   unabuser.bst  (
). 
 

These BibTeX style files modify the standard "abbrv" style by
including world-wide-web URLs in the bibliography items they
produce. Simply add  url=...  lines to your BibTeX records,
and include the LaTeX2e package  url  (or define your own
\url{} macro to format URLs). Other modifications include better
formatting of  series  lines and omission of some fields.
Unabuser is just like abuser, but unsorted.
