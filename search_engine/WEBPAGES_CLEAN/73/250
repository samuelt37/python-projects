Boeing Military Aircraft and Missiles / Phantom Works (A&amp;M/PW) Software 
Process Navigator (SPN) is an internally developed intranet tool. It is 
one of the key aspects of A&amp;M/PW Software Engineering Process Group's 
software process instantiation. The SPN allows for virtual co-location, 
promotes process and product visibility, is a good mechanism for process 
coordination and communication, and provides dynamic on-line training. The 
SPN supports on-line audits and was an enabling factor in Boeing North 
American Aircraft's achievement of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) 
Capability Maturity Model's highest software process maturity level: 
Level 5. It contributed to the significant culture change necessary in 
higher SEI rated organizations by providing access to metric and process 
based information throughout the organization, minimizing information hiding. 
This presentation will describe an overview of the SPN followed by an 
on-line demonstration.

  

 Biographies: </strong>
Ms. Abelson has spent 15 years in the aerospace industry; for the past 
six years Ms. Abelson has been involved in software process improvement. 
Ms. Abelson developed and implemented a software development process which 
incorporates an advanced metrics program capable of supporting the optimizing 
level of the CMM for software. Ms. Abelson is well versed in process 
technology transition and has been involved in numerous software process 
improvement initiatives throughout The Boeing Company. 

Mr. Puchalski is a member of the Software Engineering Process Group at 
Boeing Military Aircraft and Missiles / Phantom Works (A&amp;M/PW). He 
participated in all of the Boeing North American Aircraft SEI's CMM 
assessments, being a Level 5 Assessment Team member. He is responsible for 
administration of the A&amp;M/PW web based Software Process Navigator, which 
was a key aspect to the attainment of the Level 5 rating. His 12 year 
experience in the aerospace industry include Human Factors - Controls and 
Display work, Process Definition and Improvement, and Training. 

  

  A Customer Quality Focused Approach for Achieving SEI 
Level 4 (The Managed Level)</strong>

When the Military Aircraft Systems Division (MASD) of Northrop Grumman 
Corporation embarked on its Level 4 journey early in 1996, a considerable 
amount of time and energy was spent developing a clear understanding of 
what Level 4 meant to an organization like MASD: a defense contractor 
building medium to large systems. A number of questions needed to be 
answered, among them:

   How can quantitative software quality and process performance goals be 
     derived from non-quantitative organization and customer goals? 
  What is an effective way of developing a project's Level 4 overall 
     approach? 
  How much statistical process control knowledge did the software 
     community need to be effective with the Level 4 practices? 
 
 

This presentation describes what was done and what was learned as MASD 
achieved Level 4 for two flagship projects in December 1997 and Level 4 
for the division in October 1998. A cornerstone of the approach is the 
mapping of selected quality attributes to specific quality metrics, 
baselining those quality metrics and then setting quality goals. Along 
the way, process performance is measured and baselined, setting the stage 
for improved process capability.
