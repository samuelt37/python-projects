 "As part of the ICS Honors Program, I worked with Nicolas Lopez, one of Professor Andre van der Hoek's graduate students, on developing the Code Orb. The Code Orb merges information from other tools to provide developers with contextual information about the code they're working on in an intuitive, visual way. The best part about the program for me has been the opportunities it has provided. I was able to develop my presentation skills, work with graduate students specializing in fields that interest me, attend conferences, and gain valuable practical experience working with real technologies."
