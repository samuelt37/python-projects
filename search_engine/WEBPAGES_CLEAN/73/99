 Emily Navarro<body> ICS 139W Spring 2014, Emily Navarro  (adapted with permission from David Kay)   Changing the System:  You make the funding decisions  As you listen to your classmates' proposals today, decide which proposal(s) are most effective. Pretend that you work for a foundation or venture capital company with a budget of $1,100,000 (on 5/15 and 5/20), $1,200,000    (on 5/22 and 5/27) to spend on funding system changes, according to these guidelines:   You may spend all of your budget on one proposal or split it among many 
   You may not spend any on your own proposal 
   The amount you spend should indicate how effective you think the proposal is—a combination of how good the ideas are and how well they are presented. Don't take into account the actual dollar cost of implementing the proposal, or how well you know the person making the presentation. 
  We will accumulate the results and report them back to you. This is for interest and information only; the results will have no effect on anyone's course grade (but turning in this form is required).
