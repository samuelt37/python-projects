 ICS 10A Assignment 5 * Fall 2003<body>
  
  
    Â    
 
 This assignment is due at the beginning of
your discussion section on Wednesday, November 5.   
 
  Summary:  In this assignment you will
gain familiarity with the components and configurations of personal computers.  
 
  (a)   There are many ways to describe
a computer.  Take the computer you are using now (in the lab or at home)
and determine as many of the following characteristics as you can:  
  
 Manufacturer and model name or number  
   
 Operating system  
   
 Processor manufacturer, processor model number,
processor clock speed (MHz)  
   
 Amount of RAM  
   
 Amount of hard disk space  
   
 Other storage peripherals (e.g., CD-ROM, CD-RW,
DVD, or ZIP drives)  
   
 Monitor manufacturer, size and resolution  
   
 Printer manufacturer and model number; printer
characteristics (resolution, color, speed)  
   
 Other peripherals, if any (speakers, scanner,
...)  
  
 To learn where to find this information, feel
free to consult with your TA, your classmates, or others; just remember
that you may need to know how to find it on your own later on.  
 
  (b)   Find on the Internet the best
price for a computer that's as close as possible to the one you described.
 In most cases this will be a used computer; if your machine is still sold
new, that's also fine.  Find at least two web pages that show prices
for the comparable system and print them out along with your description.
 Where you can't find identical components (i.e., the same make and
model), substitute equivalent ones (e.g., with the same capacity or speed).  
 
 Along with your description from part  (a) ,
turn in the web pages you printed, a description of the comparable machine
you found, where you found it, its price, and any differences between your
machine and the comparable machine.  Submit this on paper.
