     Fixed one more bug in the  Official Implementation of TPES , in which the data was being correctly serialized to a file after the first time the program was executed, but not on any subsequent run.  Only TpesDataWriter.java in the  inf43.spring2009.tpes.model  package has changed. 
     Tu 6/2 
     Updated the  Official Implementation of TPES  to fix a problem that was preventing data from being serialized and deserialized automatically.  Only CourseMeeting.java in the  inf43.spring2009.tpes.model  package has changed.

     M 3/30 
     
       Welcome!  A few things: 
        The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, March 31 and the first discussion will meet on Friday, April 10.  For more information about meeting times and course policies, see the  Course Reference .  For information about lecture material and readings, see the  Schedule . 
         I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on this course web site.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the  Course Reference , the  Schedule , and the  Course Project , as well as a set of commented  Code Examples  that will be posted during the course of the quarter when we talk about Java code (which won't be often).
