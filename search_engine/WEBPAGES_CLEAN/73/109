10.23.2 Category record format 
 

 
When OEConfigure encounters a category record, it creates add a
child OEInterface object to the current OEInterface.  A category
record takes the following form.

  
    
!CATEGORY &lt;name&gt; [order priority]
  !DETAIL
    &lt;detailed description line 1&gt;
    &lt;detailed description line 2&gt;
    &lt;detailed description line 3&gt;
    .
    .
    .
  !BRIEF &lt;brief description&gt;
  [Parameter Record]
  [Category Record]
!END
    
The order individual fields appear within the category record is unimportant.
All fields within the category record are optional.  So the minimal category
record is as follows.

  
    
!CATEGORY &lt;name&gt; [order priority]
!END
    
Which, when parsed by OEConfigure is equivilant to

  
    
OEInterface* child_itf = itf.AddInterface();
child_itf-&gt;SetName(&lt;name&gt;);
child_itf-&gt;SetOrderPriority([order priority]);
    
If [order priority] is not specified 0 is assumed.

  
Fields within the category record have the following meaning.

  
     !DETAIL </strong> 
  
All lines following the !DETAIL keyword up until this next line
begining with another category record keyword are added to the
child OEInterface via

  
    
child_itf-&gt;AddDetail(&lt;detail line&gt;);
    
This field can appear once in a parameter record.

  
  
   !BRIEF  &lt;brief description&gt;</strong> 
  
    
param-&gt;SetBrief(&lt;brief description&gt;);
    
This field can only appear once.

  
  
   parmameter record </strong> 
 Parameter records can appear inside
category records.  There format is the same as those outside the
category record, however the parameter will be added to the child
interface.  A category record can hold any number of parameter
records.

 
  
   category record </strong> 
 Category records can be nested within
category records, thus creating a child OEInterface of a child
OEInterface.  There is no limit to the depth of nesting, and any
number of nested category records can appear within a category
record.
