     Brief description:  
The ProcessWall is a process state server 
	providing storage for process states plus operations
	for defining and manipulating the structure of those states.
	It separates the state of a software process
	from any program for constructing that state.
	Instead, client programs implement the processes for operating
	on the process state.
