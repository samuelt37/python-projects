  Why Improve Usability  
        Benefits to the organization

 

      Safer tools can lower costs by helping catch design errors early

  More learnable tools require less training and increase the pool of qualified workers

  Efficient tools distract the designer from his or her task less

         Benefits to individuals

 

      Increased job satisfaction, reduced stress

  More productivity

         Difficult tools will not be used: obvious usability difficulties prevent the realization of non-obvious productivity benefits
