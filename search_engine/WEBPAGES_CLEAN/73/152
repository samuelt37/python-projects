  LaTeX Symbol Lookup  
 

 

 http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html 
 

 

  LaTeX make file  
 
 name  =  paper
options  =   -- file - line -  error 
 ifeq   "$(shell uname)"   "Darwin" 
        options  +=   -- shell - escape  -- synctex = 1
 endif 
 
all :   $  (  name  )  . pdf
 
 $  (  name  )  . pdf :      *. tex  *. bib figures /*  
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        bibtex  $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
        pdflatex  $  (  options  )   $  (  name  ) 
 
clean : 
        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . aux  . blg  . log  . out  . synctex . gz ) 
 
distclean :               clean
        rm  - f  $  (  addprefix   $  (  name  )  ,   . bbl  . pdf )  

 

  Internal hyperlinks  
 

 
Include this in your preamble:
 
 \usepackage{hyperref} 

 
Then, instead of
 
 Theorem~\ref{thm:name-of-theorem} 

 
use
 
 \autoref{thm:name-of-theorem} 

 
as well as working better when you change a lemma to a theorem (etc), this produces better hyperlinks: the link covers the whole “Theorem 3” text not just the number.
 

 
In order to get this to work properly for labels that the package doesn't already know about, you may need additional preamble code like
 
 \renewcommand{\sectionautorefname}{Section} 

 

  Number lines for submissions  
 

 
It is convenient for paper reviewers to have line numbers to refer to when discussing proposed changes to your paper.
The easy way to do this is to put
 
 \usepackage{lineno} 

 
in the preamble, and to put
 
 \linenumbers 

 
 in the document itself, before the abstract.
 

 

  Less than and greater than signs in text mode  
 

 
With the default settings, LaTeX turns &lt; and &gt; in text-mode input into ¡ and ¿. This is usually just a minor annoyance (they should probably have been in math mode rather than text mode) but occasionally you really need them to render properly: for instance, when they are part of a DOI in a bibliography reference, where you don't have as much control over how to render them. The following magic code in your preamble causes them to be rendered properly:
 
 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} 

 
What this does is to change the way fonts are encoded in the output file (it has nothing to do with how TeX reads and processes your input); see  this link  for more details.
 

 

  Warn against bad formatting style and other issues  
 

 
You may have co-authors who still use outdated latex commands like \it when they should be using \emph, \$\$ … \$\$ when they should be using backslash-square-bracket, etc. To catch their errors, you can use
 
 \usepackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag} 

 
It shouldn't change the output, but may produce a lot more warnings in the log file. And regardless of whether you're using this package, check the warnings and clear them up when possible.
 

 

  Visual vs geometric line breaking  
 

 
Include this in your preamble:
 
 \usepackage{microtype} 

 
It makes line breaks visual rather than geometric (i.e. the ends of the lines are slightly different length depending on what character is there) but also makes it easier for LaTeX to avoid overfull hboxes.
 

 
See  this link  for details.
