  Ipe Tutorial: Introduction  
 

 

This is more of a random list of how-to topics than a tutorial.
 

 

  Basics  
 

 

There are three main categories of file for Ipe: 

 
    Ipe document (.ipe, .pdf, .ps, etc.) 
 
   Style sheets (.isy) 
 
   Ipelets (.lua) 
 
  

  Ipe Document  
 

 

Ipe can save and open documents in a variety of formats, including xml, pdf, and postscript. See the  Ipe Manual  for more details.
 

 
You can use  ipetoipe  to convert between these different formats. Sometimes, this might be necessary to fix problems with the program:
 

 

  Quote character (") in a layer name  
 

 

Never put quote characters (”) in the name of a layer. Ipe will crash when you try to open such a document.
 

 
Internally, Ipe saves files as xml. Even if you save it as a pdf, Ipe will embed the xml inside the pdf. Ipe must be able to parse this xml in order to properly load a file. However, if you put (”) characters in places that get written as metadata, Ipe will not be able to parse the xml. You will get poorly formatted xml that looks like this:
 
 
&lt;page title="&amp;apos;this&amp;quot; is fixed for titles"&gt;
&lt;layer name="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;view layers="don't_do_"this"" active="don't_do_"this""/&gt;
&lt;text layer="don't_do_"this"" transformations="translations" pos="128 704" stroke="black" type="label" width="36.862" height="6.128" depth="0" valign="baseline"&gt;test text&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
 

 

When you try and open this file, you will get an error like this:

 
   Document '/home/jsimons/Desktop/bad_ipe.ipe' could not be opened
  Parsing error at position 6051 

 

Ipe is helpfully trying to tell you which character the xml parser failed on. To fix it, you have to manually edit the xml. If you saved as .ipe, then just open up the file in your favorite text editor and remove the extra quotes from the xml. If you saved it as a pdf, you first have to extract the xml from the pdf (since in the pdf it's saved as a byte stream, you can't see the plain text). One easy way to do this is to run

 
 ipetoipe -xml input.pdf output.ipe 

 

  Style sheets  
 

 

Stylesheets are text files that can be included to customize various formatting aspects of an Ipe document. For example, you can use it to define more colors, add transparency levels, or create gradients. Stylesheets work a bit like preambles in LaTeX. Multiple stylesheets can be used in one Ipe document, and a single stylesheet can be reused over multiple documents.
 

 
By default, Ipe uses a basic style sheet  basic.isy . To use your own stylesheet, you can either have Ipe automatically load it for every document, or you add it manually for each document. You would want to use the former option for things that are useful across documents, like color definition and transparency levels, and the latter option for things specific to the document, like backgrounds and location of the title text.
 

 
Regardless of how you have Ipe load the stylesheet, if the stylesheet changes, you must do  Edit &gt; Update style sheets  for Ipe to see the changes.
 

 

  Loading stylesheets automatically  
 

 

Here's how we can add and change the default stylesheets loaded by Ipe.

 
    Add the stylesheets you want into a styles directory. Typically this is  ~/.ipe/styles  (you may need to create the directory yourself. 
 
   In your customization Ipelet, add the names of all the stylesheets you want to load automatically:  
prefs.styles = { "basic", "good_colors" }
 
 
 
  

  Adding stylesheets manually  
 

 

The workflow of using a stylesheet specific to a document:

 
    Create or open a stylesheet in a text editor. Here is a barebones example:    my-stylesheet.isy  
    &lt;ipestyle   name = "my-stylesheet"  &gt;  
 &lt;!--ipe customization--&gt; 
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   
 
   Edit it. Some examples of things to add can be found in this tutorial. 
 
   Save it. 
 
   Include it in the Ipe document: in Ipe, go to  Edit &gt; Style sheets &gt; Add . 
 
   Update it: in Ipe, click  Edit &gt; Update style sheets . This must be done every time an included stylesheet is modified. 
 
  

  Customizations  
 

 

You can use Ipelets to customize the behavior of Ipe.
 http://ipe7.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_40.html 
 

 
The customization script is written as an Ipelet. The easiest way to do the customization is to copy  prefs.lua ,  shortcuts.lua , and  mouse.lua  in the Ipe lua directory to your Ipelets directory and modify them to your liking. (Use  -show-configuration  to see where these directories are.)
 

 
The  mouse.lua  is also good for discovering all the useful mouse shortcuts in Ipe.
 

 

  Example Stylesheets  
 

 

  Color-blind colors  
 
   good_colors.isy  
    &lt;?xml   version = "1.0"  ?&gt;  
 &lt;!DOCTYPE ipestyle SYSTEM "ipe.dtd"&gt; 
  &lt;ipestyle   name = "good colors"  &gt;  
  &lt;color   name = "good blue"   value = "0 0.506 0.804"  /&gt;  
  &lt;color   name = "good red"   value = "0.737 0.118 0.278"  /&gt;  
  &lt;color   name = "good yellow"   value = "0.996 0.761 0"  /&gt;  
  &lt;color   name = "good green"   value = "0 0.573 0.275"  /&gt;  
  &lt;color   name = "good pink"   value = "0.8 0.2 0.8"  /&gt;  
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   

  Transparency  
 
   transparency.isy  
    &lt;ipestyle   name = "transparency"  &gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "75%"   value = "0.75"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "50%"   value = "0.5"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "25%"   value = "0.25"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "10%"   value = "0.1"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "20%"   value = "0.2"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "30%"   value = "0.3"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "40%"   value = "0.4"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "60%"   value = "0.6"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "70%"   value = "0.7"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "80%"   value = "0.8"  /&gt;  
  &lt;opacity   name = "90%"   value = "0.9"  /&gt;  
  &lt;/ipestyle &gt;    
   

  Gradient  
 

 
Here is an example code snippet to include in your stylesheet:
 
   &lt;gradient   name = "mygradient"   type = "axial"   extend = "yes"   coords = "0 0 0 600"  &gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.25"   color = "0.8 0.9 0.8"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.48"   color = "1 1 1"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.58"   color = "1 1 1"  /&gt;  
    &lt;stop   offset = "0.75"   color = "0.8 0.9 0.8"  /&gt;  
  &lt;/gradient &gt;    

 
Axial means the gradient is along a single direction. The other option is radial (needs to checked). The coordinates specify the two endpoints of the direction vector. The stops represent the different points along the direction vector at which color should change.
 

 
Once the stylesheet uploaded, the gradient option should show up in the context menu of objects that can have a gradient fill.
 

 

  Ipelets  
 

 

You can expand the existing functionality of Ipe by using Ipelets, which are  Lua  scripts that Ipe runs on-the-fly. The installed Ipelets can be accessed and used under the “Ipelets” menu item.
 

 
Each Ipelet consists of a single Lua source file with other support files. To install an Ipelet, simply save the files in your Ipelets directory. You can run  ipe -show-configuration  to find out where that directory is (typically, this is  ~/.ipe/ipelets ).
 

 
The bottom of the  Ipe Wiki  has a good list of Ipelets. They include things like automatic page numbering, background boxes for text, and graph drawing tools (where edges will follow when vertices are dragged).
 

 

  CGAL Ipelets  
 

 
This is assuming that Ipe is already installed and runs successfully.
 

 
On debian:
 
 0. Make sure you have cmake
    * $ sudo apt-get install cmake 
1. Get the required cgal library packages and all their dependencies
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
2. Get the demos and examples files
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-demo
    * For me, the demo was installed to /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/
3. Unpack the demo tar somewhere reasonable
    * $ mkdir ~/CGAL
    * $ cd ~/CGAL
    * $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/demo.tar.gz
4. Prepare the demos to be compiled
    * $ cd demo
    * $ cmake .
5. Compile the demo(s). 
To make just the Ipelets, go to the ready-to-compile subdirectory (yes, it's another nested level, demo/demo/), and make.
It will take a few minutes to compile all the Ipelets
    * $ cd ~/CGAL/demo/demo/CGAL_ipelets/
    * $ make
6. Copy the compiled output '*.so' files and the '*.lua' into the Ipelet directory. 
   On the default 7.1.3 Ipe installation, the command is:
    * $ sudo find . -name '*.so' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
    * $ sudo find ~/CGAL/demo/CGAL_ipelets/lua/ -name '*.lua' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \; 

 

  Presentations  
 

 

  Ipe presentation background  
 

 

To use an Ipe drawing as a background:

 
    group the objects of the drawing 
 
   copy the  XML  code of the group object 
 
   paste it inside the following code snippet in your Ipe stylesheet:   &lt;symbol   name = "Background"   xform = "yes"  &gt;  
 &lt;!--insert XML here--&gt; 
  &lt;/symbol &gt;    
 
 
  
The symbol name has to be  Background</strong> spelled exactly that way. The xform option allows you to only store a single copy of the background in the  PDF  file.
 

 
To turn off the background on a specific page, add a layer called  BACKGROUND</strong>. Setting that layer to visible/invisible seems to have no effect.
 

 

  Ipe presentation title  
 

 

Add something like this to your stylesheet.
 
   &lt;color   name = "titlecolor"   value = "1 0.5 0.5"  /&gt;  
  &lt;textsize   name = "titlesize"   value = "\large\bf"   /&gt;  
  &lt;textstretch   name = "titlesize"   value = "2.8"   /&gt;  
  &lt;titlestyle   pos = "25 554"   size = "titlesize"   color = "titlecolor"   halign = "left"   valign = "baseline"   /&gt;   

 
The  textsize  allows you to specify the LaTeX code for the font you want to use. The  textstretch  specifies how much to magnify the LaTex generated text, which is useful to enlargen text in a presentation. The  titlestyle  is where you specify the appearance and position of your title text.
 

 
The  textsize  and  textstretch  can be used alone to define a text style (size and shape). They simply have to have the same  name  attribute. This is a little hacky because this was only meant to define a text size and not text style.
 

 

  Miscellaneous  
 

 

  LaTeX packages  
 

 

To include a LaTeX package in Ipe, go to  Edit &gt; Document Properties &gt; Latex preamble</strong> and add the LaTeX command  \usepackage{my-package} .
 

 
Alternatively, add the following in a stylesheet:
 
   &lt;preamble &gt;   
\usepackage{my-package}
  &lt;/preamble &gt;    

 
You can also put whatever LaTeX commands usually go in the preamble of a LaTeX document in the  &lt;preamble&gt;  tags, such as  \input{} ,  \newcommand{} , etc.
