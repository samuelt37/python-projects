  Why use mod_wsgi? 
     See the  mod_wsgi  homepage.         Please note that its "daemon mode" should be the preferred way to use it (and this is the reason to prefer mod_wsgi over mod_python).       
  Basic configuring 
      Install mod_wsgi     Set up a wiki instance      Edit  wikiconfig.py       Changes to Apache configuration     Restart Apache        The sample configurations below are for a wiki instance called  mywiki  installed in a directory  /var/www/moin/mywiki  with the main MoinMoin installation installed in python's default site library path. The wiki appears as URL  /mywiki  under the server - ie  http://my.ser.ver/mywiki .  You will need to change these to reflect your installation.       
  Install mod_wsgi 
     Most people will just add a  mod_wsgi  package to their current operating system installation.  If you are building from source then you should consult the mod_wsgi documentation (it is rather easy if you have a development environment installed).       Make sure you have this line in your apache configuration or mod_wsgi will not work:           LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so      After this restart Apache and make sure that it starts successfully (also check the the error log).       
  Set up a wiki instance 
     This is done as shown in  WikiInstanceCreation . Its recommended to first configure the wiki with cgi and check that it works, then change the configuratin to use mod_wsgi. This allows you be sure that any problems are in the mod_wsgi transition rather than the basic  MoinMoin  installation.        Copy moin.cgi into your wiki directory      Configure  httpd.conf  as cgi first:               Alias /moin_static160/ "/usr/share/moin/htdocs/"
  ScriptAlias /mywiki "/var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.cgi"          Restart Apache and make test that your wiki works.       
  Edit `wikiconfig.py` 
     Make sure you use only absolute paths:             data_dir = '/var/www/moin/mywiki/data/'
  data_underlay_dir = '/var/www/moin/mywiki/underlay/'      Test that the wiki works after this change.       
  Changes to Apache configuration 
     After your wiki is running as cgi script, convert it to run with mod_wsgi.        If you run your wiki as cgi as we recommended before, remove or comment the ScriptAlias directive:           #ScriptAlias /mywiki "/var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.cgi"      Add this to the same virtualhost definition:                                     # this is for icons, css, js (and must match url_prefix from wiki config):
      Alias       /moin_static160/ /usr/share/moin/htdocs/
  
      # this is the URL http://servername/moin/ you will use later to invoke moin:
      WSGIScriptAlias /mywiki /var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.wsgi
  
      # create some wsgi daemons - use someuser.somegroup same as your data_dir:
      WSGIDaemonProcess daemonname user=someuser group=somegroup processes=5 threads=10 maximum-requests=1000
      # umask=0007 does not work for mod_wsgi 1.0rc1, but will work later
  
      # use the daemons we defined above to process requests!
      WSGIProcessGroup daemonname      Please also have a look into  moin.wsgi  - you maybe have to change some  sys.path.insert  instructions so Python can find the MoinMoin code and the wiki configuration.       Restart Apache - everything should now work correctly.
