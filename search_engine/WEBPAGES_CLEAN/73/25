        Best-First AND/OR Search for Most Probable Explanations    
       Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
				The paper evaluates the power of best-first search
				over AND/OR search spaces for solving theMost
				Probable Explanation (MPE) task in Bayesian
				networks. The main virtue of the AND/OR
				representation of the search space is its sensitivity
				to the structure of the problem, which
				can translate into significant time savings. In
				recent years depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-
				Bound algorithms were shown to be very effective
				when exploring such search spaces, especially
				when using caching. Since best-first strategies
				are known to be superior to depth-first when
				memory is utilized, exploring the best-first control
				strategy is called for. The main contribution
				of this paper is in showing that a recent extension
				of AND/OR search algorithms from depth-first
				Branch-and-Bound to best-first is indeed very effective
				for computing the MPE in Bayesian networks.
				We demonstrate empirically the superiority
				of the best-first search approach on various
				probabilistic networks.
