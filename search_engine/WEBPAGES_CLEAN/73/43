8.4.7 ExplicitDegree 
 

 
Explicit degree flag.  When set, the values returned by the
OEAtomBase::GetHvyDegree method of the query atom and potential graph
match will be tested for equivalence.  The values compared will
therefore be only the non-hydrogen degrees of the potentially
corresponding atoms.
