 Practice Using Checkin 
 
 

The following instructions describe how to practice using  Checkin 
  on a special "test class".
When you actually use  Checkin  you will select the class for which you
  are checking in (you might be using  Checkin  in multiple classes),
  along with the announced word of the day.

  
Access the  Checkin  
  web page.
You should see the following page that identifies the  Checkin  system,
  which asks you to  Please Login to the system .
 
   


  
Click  Login .
You should see the standard  UCInetID Secure Web Login 
 
   
Enter your standard  UCInetID  and  Password .
  

   
Click  Login .
 
As illustrated on the screen below, select your  Course 
  (if it is not already selected by the  Checkin  link you used
   to reach this page: in such cases the  Course  will be supplied
   and not changeable) and the  Word of the Day .
For testing purposes, use the course
   UCI-General: Test Checking :: Test your checkin 
  and the word of the day whatever day of the week you
  are testing on (I was testing on a  Thrusday ).
  
   

   
Click  I am in class .
 
If you choose an actual course (not the test one), it is likely to show (before
  the quarter starts) as an error:
  
   
If the word is correct, and you have checked in successfully, you should see
  the following screen, affirming that you successfully checked in.
