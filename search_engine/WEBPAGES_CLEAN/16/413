OEErrorHandler OEThrow
    
This is the globally available error handler that is used to report all
diagnostics generated by the OEChem, OESystem and OEPlatform libraries.
The behavior of  OEThrow  may be customized via the various methods
availble to  OEErrorHandler .  For example, warning and error messages
may be redirected to a file or string stream, instead of to
 OEPlatform::oeerr  (the default).
