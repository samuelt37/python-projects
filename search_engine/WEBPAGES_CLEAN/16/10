&gt; However, it is not entirely clear to me what the tradeoffs are between
&gt; using the URL parameter mechanism (e.g., ";version={version identifier}")
&gt; versus using the URL query mechanism (e.g., "?version={version
&gt; identifier}").  Can any members of the list shed some light on the intent
&gt; of these two mechanisms?  This information is unavailable in either the
&gt; HTTP specification or RFC 1738 (Uniform Resource Locators).

The advantage to using the URL parameter mechanism is that it
allows you to specify a query against and old version of the
page, of course :-)

More to the point, URL queries are very common already, and I'd
worry about specifying a standard name for a query that might
conflict with somebody's existing query scripts.
