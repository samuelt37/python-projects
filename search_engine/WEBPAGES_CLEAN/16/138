A parallelization of the quadtree constructions in
" Provably good mesh generation ",
in an integer model of computation, based on a technique of
sorting the input points using values formed by shuffling the binary
representations of the coordinates.
A side-effect is an efficient construction for the "fair split tree"
hierarchical clustering method used by Callahan and Kosaraju for various
nearest neighbor problems.

    Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems .

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, " Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families ", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

We study  finite element mesh  smoothing
problems in which we
move vertex locations to optimize the shapes of nearby
triangles.  Many such problems can be solved in linear time using
 generalized linear programming ; we also give
efficient
algorithms for some non-LP-type mesh smoothing problems.
One lemma may be of independent interest: the locus of points in R d 
from which a d-1 dimensional convex set subtends a given solid angle
is convex.

    Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing .  M. Bern

Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Durham, North Carolina, 1997.   6th Int. Meshing Roundtable,  Park

We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

We use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " to detect collisions among a collection of moving
objects in sublinear time per collision.  As one application, we can
construct the  straight skeleton  of Aichholzer et al (and the mitered
offset curves from which it is defined) in subquadratic time.

(special issue for GD98).
 
We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
" The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The
Computer J.  51: 292–302, 2008.

    Algorithms for coloring quadtrees .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and
B. Hutchings.  arXiv:cs.CG/9907030 .  Algorithmica  32 (1): 87–94, 2002.
 
We consider several variations of the problem of
 coloring  the squares of a
 quadtree  so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

    Incremental and decremental maintenance of planar width .

We show how to maintain the width of a planar point set, subject to
insertions or deletions (but not both) in time
O( n   c  ) per update for any  c  &gt; 0.
The idea is to apply our  dynamic closest pair
data structure  to an appropriate measure of distance between
pairs of convex hull features.

We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
 low-dimensional linear programming 
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
 minimum spanning trees ,
 shortest paths , and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

    Tangent spheres and triangle centers .

Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .

    Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern

 16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  28 (1): 1–17, 2002.
 
We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".
