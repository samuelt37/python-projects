Abstract
Constraint networks are a simple representation and reasoning framework 
with diverse applications. In this paper, we identify two new complementary 
properties on the restrictiveness of the constraints in a network-constraint 
tightness and constraint looseness-and we show their usefulness for estimating 
the level of local consistency needed to ensure global
consistency, and for estimating the level of local consistency present in a
network. In particular, we present a sufficient condition, based on constraint 
tightness and the level of local consistency, that guarantees that
a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. The condition can
be useful in applications where a knowledge base will be queried over and
over and the preprocessing costs can be amortized over many queries. We
also present a sufficient condition for local consistency, based on constraint
looseness, that is straightforward and inexpensive to determine. The condition 
can be used to estimate the level of local consistency of a network.
This in turn can be used in deciding whether it would be useful to preprocess 
the network before a backtracking search, and in deciding which
local consistency conditions, if any, still need to be enforced if we want
to ensure that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. Two
deffinitions of local consistency are employed in characterizing the conditions: 
the traditional variable-based notion and a new deffinition of local
consistency called relational consistency. New algorithms for enforcing
relational consistency are introduced and analyzed.
