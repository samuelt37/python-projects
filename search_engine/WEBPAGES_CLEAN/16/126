3.17.5 Active Conformer 
 

 
This section details the API for modal access to conformers.

  
    
virtual bool SetActive(OEConfBaseT&lt;C,dim&gt; *conf) = 0
virtual OEConfBaseT&lt;C,dim&gt; *GetActive() const = 0
virtual bool PushActive(OEConfBaseT&lt;C,dim&gt;*conf) = 0
virtual void PopActive() = 0
    
These four functions can be used to set the  OEMCMolBase  into a
state where it acts as if it is an  OEMolBase  with coordinates the
same as the active conformer ( e.g.  - the  OEMCMolBaseT  is put
in the ``mode'' of the selected conformer).   SetActive  makes the
conformer passed in become the active conformer.  The conformer passed in
must already be a member of the  OEMCMolBase .   GetActive() 
returns the currently active conformer.  These two functions are often
sufficient for all the needs of modal access in multi-conformer molecules.

  
In rare cases, it may be important to maintain a stack of active
conformers.  For these cases, the  PushActive  and  PopActive 
functions are defined.   PushActive  makes the new conf the active
conformer and pushed the previous active conformer down the stack.
 PopActive  removes the top active conformer from the active stack and
makes the next highest conformer in the stack active.
