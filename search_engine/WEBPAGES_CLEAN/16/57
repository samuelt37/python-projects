11. Connectivity Processing 
 

 
OEChem provides several functions for determine the connectivity
and/or bond orders from various input file formats.  For correct
molecule processing, OEChem requires all the covalent bonds to be
represented in a molecule and each bond to have a defined bond order,
1 for single, 2 for double, 3 for triple and 4 for quadruple.  Given
this explicit Kekulé representation of a molecule, OEChem can perceive
and re-perceive high order attributes such as ring membership or
aromaticity as defined by different aromaticity models (definitions of
aromaticity).

  
Alas, unlike MDL's SD file format, not all file formats explicitly
specify a Kekulé form of a molecule with explicit bond orders.  The
routines below attempt to deduce such a representation from the
information that is available in such file formats.
