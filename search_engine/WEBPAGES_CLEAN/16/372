If you really want to surf into the past, maybe you need to decorate
the URLs at the beginning rather than the end, with the idea that
relative links might still work.

e.g., make

 http://myserver.com//VERSION=12//stuff.html 

instead of

 http://myserver.com/stuff.html 


Then any relative links don't have to get rewritten in order to refer
to the same branch. I guess this only works for named revision trees.
