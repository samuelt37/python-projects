11.3 Perceiving Bond Orders 
 

 
The  OEPerceiveBondOrders  function is used to deduce bond orders from
the 3D co-ordinates and simple connectivity of a molecule.  If the
simple connectivity,  i.e.  bonds without bond orders isn't specified in
the input file,  OEDetermineConnectivity  should be called first to
deduce this information from the 3D coordinates.
