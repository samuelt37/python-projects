Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.
