 An Anytime Scheme for Bounding Posterior Belief 

 Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
This report presents an any-time scheme for computing lower and
upper bounds on posterior marginals in Bayesian networks. The
scheme draws from two previously proposed methods, bounded
conditioning [9] and bounds propagation algorithm [16]. Following
the principles of cutset conditioning [18], our method enumerates a
subset of cutset tuples and applies exact reasoning in the network
instances conditioned on those tuples. The probability mass of the
remaining tuples is bounded using a variant of bound propagation.
We show that our new scheme improves on the earlier schemes.
