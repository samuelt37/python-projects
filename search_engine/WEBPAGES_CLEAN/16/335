bool operator()(OEMolBase &amp;mol) const
    
This method applies the set of transformations with which the
 OEUniMolcularRxn  object has been initialized.  The method will
return true if the reactant pattern matches at least one time in the
passed molecule instance.  If the  OEUniMolecularRxn  fails to
apply any transformations because the reactant pattern failed to match
the molecule, the method will return false.
