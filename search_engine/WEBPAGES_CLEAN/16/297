 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Setting MSXML in the CLASSPATH on Solaris<body>
 

 Setting MSXML in the CLASSPATH on Solaris 

  
This section provides an example of how to set up your downloaded XML parser
in the CLASSPATH.  This assumes that you have uncompressed and un-tared it 
on your system.
 

  Note: the tcsh shell was used for this example. 


  Changing the CLASSPATH to include the XML Parser 

  You will need to add the path to the xml.class file and the classes
directory to your CLASSPATH environment variable so that your 
Java interpretor will find it.
  

  Setting the CLASSPATH to the xml.class file and the classes 
directory 

  To set the CLASSPATH variable, you may use the command setenv.
You need to set the CLASSPATH to include the path to the 
xml.class file and the classes directory for msxml.
The command will look like this:
  setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH': path_to_msxml.class :
 path_to_msxml_classes ' 
 

 
Note: The ' symbol is used to quote all the characters between them.  This 
is needed so that tcsh won't interpret the colon symbols :.
 

 
In the example below, the first path is set to the directory where the
msxml.class file is located and the second path is to the classes directory
where the other class files used by the xml parser are located.
 
Note: If you move msxml.class into the classes directory, you 
don't need the first path.
 

   

  You now have the MSXML set for your system.
