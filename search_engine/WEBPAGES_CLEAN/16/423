   SocioTechnical Approaches to Information Dissemination 
   Outline 
    Given the current trend to obtain information anytime and anywhere, Information Dissemination is a critical technology/service
for future generations under a variety of scenarios.  In this course, we will develop
an understanding of the key factors in effective dissemination to the public at large and design technology innovations to enable
faster, robust and more effective content dissemination.
For example, in the context of crisis alert systems, conveying accurate and
timely information to those who are actually at risk (or likely to be), while providing reassuring information to those who
are not at risk will provide a better response to the crisis at hand. 

The course will explore key factors that pose significant challenges (social and technological) to effective information dissemination.
These factors include variation in notification times for different applications (e.g. warning times in the emergency response case),
determining the specificity of  information to effectively communicate to different populations, and customization of the delivery process to reach the targeted populations in time over unreliable infrastructures and networks.
The course will also explore how effective dissemination requires a multidisciplinary approach that
    understands and utilizes the context in which the dissemination of information occurs to determine sources, recipients, channels of targeted messages  
      develop technological solutions that can deliver appropriate and accessible information to the public rapidly.  
 
From a  social science</strong> perspective, we will look into models and theories for information diffusion in social networks and the role of traditional and
alternative independent communication technologies (blogs, social networks ala FaceBook, MySpace) in effectively reaching the target audience. 
From a  information technology and systems</strong> perspective, we will look at techniques to build highly customized, robust and timely dissemination services from unstable and unreliable resources over both wired and wireless networks using a variety of technologies such as peer-based architectures, wireless mesh networks and
publish/subscribe architectures.
