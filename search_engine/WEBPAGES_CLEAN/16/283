We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

    Emerging challenges in computational topology .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, et al.  arXiv:cs.CG/9909001 .  
This is the report from the ACM Workshop on Computational Topology
run by Marshall and myself in Miami Beach, June 1999.
It details goals, current research, and recommendations
in this emerging area of collaboration between computer science and
mathematics.
