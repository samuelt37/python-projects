      Aviation Weather Awareness and Reporting Enhancements (AWARE)
     
     
        
        
  
 Overview 
 
  
AWARE (Aviation Weather Awareness and reporting
Enhancements) is a NASA Cooperative Research and
Development program conducted jointly by Rockwell
Science Center, Rockwell Collins, University of California,
Irvine, and NASA.
 
AWARE is an enhanced weather briefing and reporting
tool that integrates text-based and graphical aviation
weather data for superior situational awareness in the
context of a mission and equipment profile. It is designed
to benefit general aviation pilots who, due to cognitive
overload, may not absorb and retain all flight-critical
weather information from a vast stream of data that they
are legally required to review.
