 Computer Law Seminar Readings  
  
 This list of assigned readings will grow as
the quarter progresses.  We'll mark new additions conspicuously; a few
marked 
 
 have been added as of June 1.  Some of the listings here are not assignments;
they're there for reference (and may be useful as you look into your
project topics).  
 
 Many of these materials were written for lawyers,
which means they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring them to class
so I can (try to) clarify them.   
 
 Most of these references are available on-line,
but some will be available only on paper.  Access instructions for paper
materials appear below.  
 
 Access to some of the electronic references
may be restricted to the UCI community (which is an example of intellectual
property law in practice).  The URLs to those references will work from
computers at UCI.  If you (as a UCI student) want access from off campus,
you'll need to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using free software
available from UCI's NACS (for Windows, Linux, or MacOS X).  NACS has
a page describing how to download and install the VPN software:  http://www.nacs.uci.edu/security/vpn.html 
.  
 
 The readings come from a variety of sources,
such as:  
  
 Law review article--a law review is a publication
containing scholarly articles about the law, typically written by law professors
(for the main articles) or law students (for the shorter articles, often
designated "Note" or "Comment").  Law reviews are roughly
akin to academic journals in CS, except that they're edited at law schools
by law students.  A citation with "L.R" or "L.J." in
the title, especially along with a law school name, is probably a law review.
 Law review articles are among the most intensively documented publications
in the world; every assertion is backed up with a citation in a footnote.
 A tongue-in-cheek metric of the scholarly quality of a law review article
is the extent to which the volume of the footnotes exceeds the volume of
the main document.  
   
 Popular media article--Newspaper and magazine
articles tend to be accessible, since they're written for non-lawyers,
but they're subject to the problems we discussed in class (incompleteness,
oversimplification, technical inaccuracy, focus on sensational facts over
legal issues).  
   
 Article in a professional publication--Articles
for computing professionals (e.g., in the  Communications of the ACM )
or for legal professionals (e.g., in the  ABA Journal  from the American
Bar Association) often hit a good balance between accessibility and accuracy.

 This is only available on paper; the packet looks large, but the print
is not dense.  You can find this packet on the bookshelf in my outer office,
CS 406, which is generally open during business hours.  There's a nice
couch there where you can read it; if you take it away to read elsewhere,
leave a note so a classmate won't look in vain.  (The packet is on the
bookshelf near the blackboard, bound with a large black metal clip.)
