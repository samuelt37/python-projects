		    DataGuard Description 
		 
			DataGuard middleware allows users to outsource their file system to heterogeneous data storage providers available
			on Internet. DataGuard preserves also data confidentiality and integrity of outsourced information using
			cryptographic techniques. DataGuard is fundamentally designed to be easy to use to the average user.

                    full version of the academic paper  here . A shorter version
                    of the paper is currently under submission.
