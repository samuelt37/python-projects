Multilayer perceptrons behave similarly, as shown in figure 4, as confirmed by experiments performed with the Solar,  Wine   Glass and Servo data sets. The most important difference with high order perceptrons is that the networks do not or only very slowly converge for weight variances close to zero. Such variances should therefore not be used       Kamal Ali and Michael J. Pazzani.  Error Reduction through Learning Multiple Descriptions .

It is important to analyze these experimental data because the amount of error reduction obtained by using multiple models varies a great deal. On the  wine  data set, for example, the error obtained by uniformly weighted voting between eleven, stochastically-generated descriptions is only one seventh that of the error obtained by using a single description.
