 Abstract  
This paper studies truth-maintenance and belief revision tasks on singly-connected
structures for the purpose of understanding how structural features could be exploited in
such tasks. We present distributed algorithms and show that, in the JTMS framework,
both belief revision and consistency maintenance are linear in the size of the 
knowledgebase on singly connected structures. However, the ATMS task is exponential in the
branching degree of the network. The singly-connected model, while restrictive, is useful
for three reasons. First, efficient algorithms on singly-connected models can be utilized
in more general structures by employing well-known clustering techniques. Second, these
algorithms can serve as approximations or as heuristics in algorithms that perform 
truth-maintenance on general problems. Finally, the analysis provides insights for 
understanding the sources of the computational difficulties associated with JTMS and ATMS.
