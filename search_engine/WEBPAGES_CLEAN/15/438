 Abstract   
   
This demo paper provides a brief description of the  intuition and design 
philosophy of CAMAS, one of the main testbeds being  developed in the context 
of the RESCUE (Responding to the Unexpected)  project [9]. The goal of our 
work is to enhance the mitigation capabilities  of first responders in the 
event of a crisis by dramatically transforming  their ability to collect, 
store, analyze, interpret, share and disseminate  data. CAMAS specifically is 
a system designed to allow a variety of users,  including the average citizen 
to report incidents and potentially hazardous  situations, analyze and 
evaluate these reports and notify appropriate  personnel for further action. 
The multidisciplinary approach incorporates a  variety of information 
technologies: networks; distributed systems;  databases; image and video 
processing; GIS; and machine learning, together  with subjective information 
obtained through social science. Besides  providing an overview of the CAMAS 
architecture, we describe the  demonstration platform and specific experiments 
that will illustrate issues  of event extraction, ranking, access control and 
visualization.
