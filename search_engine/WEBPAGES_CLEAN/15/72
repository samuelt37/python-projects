      Appearance Editing      
   
    
    In this system we superimposes multiple projections onto an
  object of arbitrary shape and color to produce high resolution appearance
  changes. Our system produces appearances at a resolution higher than what is
  possible with a single projector and can change appearances at near
  interactive rates. We achieved several appearance edits including specular
  lighting, subsurface scattering, inter-reflections, and color, texture, and
  geometry changes on objects with different shapes and colors.      
    Appearance Editing is a collaborative project with Prof. Dan Aliaga's group
  in Purdue University.
