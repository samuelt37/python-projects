				 If a parametric optimization problem and a desired optimal solution are given, the parameter values that lead to the given problem and the solution are to be sought. This is an "inverse parametric optimization" problem. This paper describes algorithms for solving such problems for minimum spanning trees, shortest paths and some other subgraph problems and discusses applications in multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board game programming.
