			Software Engineering

     Automation and collaboration is a major building block for software engineering via the Web
 
  Collaborative development of software artifacts
  XML is a flexible marshalling syntax for remote operations like a remote software build
  ISENs inform other software engineers on the status of development artifacts
       
 
     In turn, Web-based software engineering supports virtual development teams.
