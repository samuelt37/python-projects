Achieving good angular resolution in 3D arc drawings 
 
  Pawel Pszona 
 
We study a 3D analogue to the well-known 2D arc diagrams.
We provide several algorithms that achieve good angular resolution,
utilizing various graph coloring algorithms, including an algorithm
for a new coloring problem, which we call "localized edge coloring". 
(Joint work with Michael Goodrich.)
