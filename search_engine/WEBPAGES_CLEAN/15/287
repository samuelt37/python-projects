 Compiler-Directed Aggressive Prefetching<body>

  Compiler-Directed Aggressive Prefetching  
      The compiler can facilitate prefetching  (e.g., by ensuring that data is prefetched well ahead of its use - possibly several iterations early). 
 
     
 
     The compiler can also attempt to establish data-fetch patterns (e.g., stride regularity/size) and use it to generate either certain or speculative prefetches. 
 
     
 
     To minimize memory bandwidth requirements, the compiler can prioritize prefetching in order of importance, based on global analysis of the code.
 
     
 
     This essentially requires the same information as ILP exploitation.
