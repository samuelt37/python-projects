   Parallel recognition of series parallel graphs . 
D. Eppstein.   Information &amp; Computation  98: 41â€“55, 1992 .
 
Characterizes two-terminal series graphs in terms of a
tree-like structure in their ear decompositions.
Uses this characterization to construct
parallel algorithms that recognize these graphs and
construct their series-parallel decompositions.
