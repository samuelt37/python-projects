    public class  TaskSynchronization 
    extends Object
   
Task synchronization monitor.
  Task synchronization monitors in the same job should always
 be disjoint.</strong>
 
    
 
    
      TaskSynchronization  (Task, Task[])
      Constructs a task synchronization monitor.
   
    
      hasCommonTasks  (TaskSynchronization)
      Tests if this monitor has any tasks in common with the
 given one.
        involves  (Task)
      Tests if the given task is involved in this synchronization.
        joinWith  (TaskSynchronization)
      Joins this monitor with the given one.
        size  ()
      Returns the number of involved tasks.
        synchronize  (Task, Simulator)
      Synchronizes the given task.
        toString  ()
      Returns a string representation of this object.
    
 
    
  
   
 TaskSynchronization 
 
 public TaskSynchronization( Task  task,
                             Task  syncTasks[])
 
   Constructs a task synchronization monitor.
 
        Parameters: 
       task - requesting task.
      syncTasks - tasks to synchronize with.
      
    
 
    
   
  size  
 
 public int size()
 
   Returns the number of involved tasks.
 
        Returns: 
       the number of involved tasks.
     
     
  involves  
 
 public boolean involves( Task  task)
 
   Tests if the given task is involved in this synchronization.
 
        Parameters: 
       task - a task.
        Returns: 
        true  if task is involved in this
 synchronization;  false  otherwise.
     
     
  synchronize  
 
 public boolean synchronize( Task  task,
                             Simulator  simulator)

        Parameters: 
       task - a task.
      simulator - a simulator.
         Returns: 
        true  if all tasks have been synchronized
 after this;  false  otherwise.
     
     
  hasCommonTasks  
 
 public boolean hasCommonTasks( TaskSynchronization  ts)
 
   Tests if this monitor has any tasks in common with the
 given one.
 
        Parameters: 
       ts - a task synchronization monitor.
        Returns: 
        true  if this monitor has any tasks in
 common with the given one;  false  otherwise.
     
     
  joinWith  
 
 public void joinWith( TaskSynchronization  ts)
 
   Joins this monitor with the given one.
 
        Parameters: 
       ts - a task synchronization monitor.
