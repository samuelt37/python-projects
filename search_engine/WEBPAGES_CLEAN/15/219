 "My research experience with the honors program was highly enjoyable. I worked with Professor Lisa Pearl, in Cognitive Sciences, on the creation of a web-based game to gather linguistic data. This was an incredibly fun topic for me, as it merged the skills from my major (ICS) with the interest of my minor (Linguistics). I ended up taking four quarters of honors research, despite only needing two. I get along very well with my advisor, and it's very beneficial to have such a close relationship to a professor. I learned a great deal about Perl, MySQL and self-motivation for a project. The ICS Honors Program additionally complemented the Campuswide Honors Program requirements (both require research and a thesis). I think that participating in this program has added a lot of depth to my undergraduate career."
