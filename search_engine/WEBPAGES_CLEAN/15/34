  Ipe Tutorial: Introduction  
 

 

This pages gives a general overview of Ipe. It is meant to get you acquainted with the application and describe how it can be customized.

  Ipelets  
 

 

You can expand the existing functionality of Ipe by using Ipelets, which are  Lua  scripts that Ipe runs on-the-fly. The installed Ipelets can be accessed and used under the “Ipelets” menu item.
 

 
Each Ipelet consists of a single Lua source file with other support files. To install an Ipelet, simply save the files in your Ipelets directory. You can run  ipe -show-configuration  to find out where that directory is (typically, this is  ~/.ipe/ipelets ).
 

 
The bottom of the  Ipe Wiki  has a good list of Ipelets. They include things like automatic page numbering, background boxes for text, and graph drawing tools (where edges will follow when vertices are dragged).
 

 

  CGAL Ipelets  
 

 
This is assuming that Ipe is already installed and runs successfully.
 

 
On debian:
 
 0. Make sure you have cmake
    * $ sudo apt-get install cmake 
1. Get the required cgal library packages and all their dependencies
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
2. Get the demos and examples files
    * $ sudo apt-get install libcgal-demo
    * For me, the demo was installed to /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/
3. Unpack the demo tar somewhere reasonable
    * $ mkdir ~/CGAL
    * $ cd ~/CGAL
    * $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo/demo.tar.gz
4. Prepare the demos to be compiled
    * $ cd demo
    * $ cmake .
5. Compile the demo(s). 
To make just the Ipelets, go to the ready-to-compile subdirectory (yes, it's another nested level, demo/demo/), and make.
It will take a few minutes to compile all the Ipelets
    * $ cd ~/CGAL/demo/demo/CGAL_ipelets/
    * $ make
6. Copy the compiled output '*.so' files and the '*.lua' into the Ipelet directory. 
   On the default 7.1.3 Ipe installation, the command is:
    * $ sudo find . -name '*.so' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
    * $ sudo find ~/CGAL/demo/CGAL_ipelets/lua/ -name '*.lua' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;
