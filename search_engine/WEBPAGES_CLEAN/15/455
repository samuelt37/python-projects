O.k. o.k. maybe Sunday was a bit hopeful. My specification of Microsoft's 
needs in the area of versioning and file control will be ready by tomorrow. 
I have already collected all of the data I need. What I am doing now is 
going through it and summarizing it. It is taking longer than I expected. 
In the worst case I will release the requirements specification tomorrow 
and then deliver my suggested solutions to those needs on Tuesday or 
Wednesday. I am sorry for the delay.
