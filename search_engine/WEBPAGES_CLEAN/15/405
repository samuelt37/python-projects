See LRM section 8.7

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    All possible choices must be included, unless the  others  clause is used as the last choice:
 case SEL is
  when "01" =&gt;   Z &lt;= A;
  when "10" =&gt;   Z &lt;= B;
  when others =&gt; Z &lt;= 'X';
end case;
 
 
    

 
    A range or a selection may be specified as a choice:
 case INT_A is
  when 0      =&gt;  Z &lt;= A;
  when 1 to 3 =&gt;  Z &lt;= B;
  when 4|6|8  =&gt;  Z &lt;= C;
  when others =&gt;  Z &lt;= 'X';
end case;
 
 
    

 
    Choices may not overlap
 case INT_A is
  when 0      =&gt;  Z &lt;= A;
  when 1 to 3 =&gt;  Z &lt;= B;
  when 2|6|8  =&gt;  Z &lt;= C;   -- illegal
  when others =&gt;  Z &lt;= 'X';
end case;
 
 
    

 
    A range may not be used with a vector type
 case VEC is
  when "000" to "010" 
               =&gt;  Z &lt;= A;   -- illegal
  when "111"   =&gt;  Z &lt;= B;
  when others  =&gt;  Z &lt;= 'X';
end case;

         Synthesis Issues        
  

The CASE statement is generally synthesisable.
 
With repeated assignments to a target signal, it willsynthesise to a
large multiplexer with logic on the select inputs to evaluate the
conditions for the different choices in the case statement branches. No
"priority" will be inferred from the order of the branches
  
With multiple targets and embedded  if  statements, the  case 
statement may be used to synthesise a general mapping function, e.g.
next state and output generation for a finite state machine. For
example:  
  
     case READ_CPU_STATE is
  when WAITING =&gt;
    if CPU_DATA_VALID = '1' then
      CPU_DATA_READ  &lt;= '1';
      READ_CPU_STATE &lt;= DATA1;
    end if;
  when DATA1 =&gt;
    -- etc.
end case;
  
    

 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, the  case statement may have an optional label:
  label:  case  expression  is 
... etc.
 end case  label;
