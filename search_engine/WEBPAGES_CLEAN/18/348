  Simulation movies  

   activatorWusTemplate.mov  
( .avi ) 

Simulation movie of the activator model simulated an a topology
extracted from an experimental template. The simulation shows the
WUSCHEL concentrations. The simulation starts with zero WUS
concentrations everywhere and show the emerging WUS domain (Figure 6A
in the paper).

   
 activatorWusLatticeAblated.mov 
( .avi ) 

Simulation movie of the activator model simulated on a lattice
topology emulating the laser ablation experiment. The simulation shows
the WUSCHEL concentrations. The simulation starts with zero WUS
concentrations everywhere and show the emerging WUS domains (Figure
7E-F in the paper).
