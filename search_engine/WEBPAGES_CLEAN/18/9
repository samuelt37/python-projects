        AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs) for Graphical Models

              Abstract   
            Inspired by the recently introduced framework of AND/OR search spaces for graphical models,
            we propose to augment Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDD) with AND nodes, in order
            to capture function decomposition structure and to extend these compiled data structures to general
            weighted graphical models (e.g., probabilistic models). We present the AND/OR Multi-Valued
            Decision Diagram (AOMDD) which compiles a graphical model into a canonical form that supports
            polynomial (e.g., solution counting, belief updating) or constant time (e.g. equivalence of
            graphical models) queries. We provide two algorithms for compiling the AOMDD of a graphical
            model. The first is search-based, and works by applying reduction rules to the trace of the memory
            intensive AND/OR search algorithm. The second is inference-based and uses a Bucket Elimination
            schedule to combine the AOMDDs of the input functions via the the APPLY operator. For both
            algorithms, the compilation time and the size of the AOMDD are, in the worst case, exponential in
            the treewidth of the graphical model, rather than pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision
            diagrams (OBDDs). We introduce the concept of semantic treewidth, which helps explain why
            the size of a decision diagram is often much smaller than the worst case bound. We provide an
            experimental evaluation that demonstrates the potential of AOMDDs.
