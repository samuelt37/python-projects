         Welcome to the lab for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics at School of Information and Computer Sciences of  University of California, Irvine!   



Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, computer vision and NLP.
