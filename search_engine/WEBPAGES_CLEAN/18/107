4.4 Properties of Multi-Conformer Molecules 
 

 
Multi-conformer molecules in OEChem are represented by OEMCMolBases.
OEMCMolBase derives from OEMolBase and thus contains all of the properties
of molecules discussed above.  In addition to keeping track of the atoms
and bonds of a molecule, OEMCMolBases keep track of conformations of
molecule.  For this discussion, conformations can be thought of as
different representations of molecules which share the same heavy-atom
graph.  In OEChem, these conformers are represented by OEConfBase, which
are first-class objects.

  
OEMCMolBases (or their OEMol wrappers) can be used as either a molecule
with a particular one of its conformers represented as its current "state",
or as a container of conformers with access to many of them at once.
