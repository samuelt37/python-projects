  Replicators : B357/S3458 

 I found this replicator on Oct. 31, 2001. It repeats every 15
generations, on a one-dimensional 5-unit grid. 

     

 This rule has  several known
spaceships . It is unknown whether the replicator can lead to
high-period oscillators, spaceships, guns, or other interesting
technology.
