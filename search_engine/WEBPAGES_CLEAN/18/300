 Iterators via Classes


In this lecture we will first learn how to fix a problem (related to sharing
objects) with the prange class that we wrote in the last lecture: by using a
NESTED CLASS for iteration. Next, we look at a new type that stores and
manipulates data (histograms), and also allows iteration over its data. Finally,
we will begin to explore functions and classes that decorate iterables: they
operate on iterables and produce other iterables (e.g., sorted and reversed are
two examples built into Python, but there are many other interesting and useful
ones).

We will finish the week with a lecture about a special kind of function called
a generator, which provides a simple and excellent mechanism for writing
iterators (and iterators that decorate iterators). All this material will
become even more important and useful when we spend a week talking about
inheritance among classes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixing a sharing problem with prange

In the last lecture we discussed various classes that implemented the iterator
protocol (by implementing the methods __iter__ and __next__). Typically in these
cases (for both the Countdown and prange classes) the main purpose of the class
was to create an object to iterate over once. That is, we processed objects from
these classes only (or primarily) by iterating over them. Contrast these classes
to the list, tuple, set, and dict class: while we often iterate over these
objects, we also peform many other useful operations on them too: e.g.,
examining and/or updating data in them.

Often we construct an object from Countdown and prange only for use in a for
loop: e.g., for i in prange(...) : .... We don't even bind this object to a
name, so the objects are used just once in the for loop, and when the for loop
finishes these objects disappear, so they cannot be reused.

But at the end of the last lecture we started discussing sharing, and we will
start our discussion here by looking at another example of sharing, and how to
fix a defect in our first implementation of the prange class (so that it behaves
more like the real range class). Doing so will involve defining and
constructing a class nested in the prange class, whose sole purpose is to
construct an object returned by __iter__ and provide a __next__ method for this
object to allow us to iterate over it. We will see that when we write iterators
for other classes, controlling more complicated data, this same technique works
nicely.

To illustate the defect, we first define the following function, which uses a
doubly-iterating comprehension to return all pairs of values produced by its
single argument iterators. Here i1 and i2 are two objects that are iterable.

def all_pair(i1,i2):
    return [(x,y) for x in i1 for y in i2]

this code is equivalent to

def all_pair(i1,i2):
    answer = []
    for x in i1:
        for y in i2:
            answer.append((x,y))
    return answer

So, in the outer for loop we iterate over i1, and while we are doing this we
iteratve over i2 in the inner for loop.

Now let's run this function in various interesting ways, with range/prange (in
one case, illustrating a difference in how these classes perform).

r = range (3)
p = prange(3)

print(all_pair(r,p))	# use range and prange
print(all_pair(p,r))	# use prange and range
print(all_pair(r,r))	# use only range,  but the same range object twice
print(all_pair(p,p))	# use only prange, but the same range object twice

These four print statements produce the following results. Notice the first
three result are the same (producing tuples containing all pairs of the values
in the range), but differ from the fourth (producing only the first of the
tuples). The difference occurs when the same prange iterable argument is passed
to both parameters.

[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]

The last use of p (using it twice in a call to all_pair) above produces the
wrong results. The problem is that when __iter__ is called on a prange, it
returns the object itself on which __iter__ was called. So both loops are using
the SAME OBJECT to iterate over.

Both for loops in the all_pair function share the iterator/object: the outer
loop initializes it and gets the first value, then the inner loop
re-initializes it and gets the values 0, 1, 2; when the inner for loop exhausts
the iterator, it is also exhausted in the outer for loop (so the outer loop
immediately terminates after producing only 3 tuples). In summary, the problem
is that we are doing nested/multiple iteration on a single object.

Python's standard range function doesn't suffer from problem, and we will fix
prange to operate likewise: when we call iter on range (and soon on prange) it
will return a special object to iterate over. In nested iteration, iter is
called twice so two different objects will participate in the iteration.

As a reminder, here is how prange defined __iter__ and __next__ in the previous
lecture.

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = self.start
        return self          # return an object on which __next__ can be called
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.step &gt; 0 and self.n &gt;= self.stop or \
           self.step  0 and self.n &gt;= self.stop or \
                   self.step  0 and self.n &gt;= self.stop or \
               self.step  0 and self.n &gt;= self.stop or \
               self.step 2}-{h: &gt;3}] | {s}'.format(l=10*i,h=10*i+9 if i != 9 else 100,s=self[i]*'*') for i in range(10)])

Notes:

0) The __init__ method uses the idiom 10*[0] which you should know. If not,
experiment with it.

1) The _tally function is supposed to be called by only methods defined in this
class. It puts a number in the range [0,100] into the correct bin, treating 100
specially (it belongs in bin 9, but p//10 would put it in bin 10, which doesn't
exist).

2) The clear method sets each bin in the list to 0; we could have allocated a
new list as shown in the comment, but generally that takes more time and
occupies more space.

3) By using *args, the tally method can have any number (0 or more) of
positional arguments. All arguments are collected into tuple that is iterated 
over to process the value individually. If there is not at least one value, or
any value is out of range, this method raises an exception.

4) The __getitem__ method allows us to index all the bins, 0-9 inclusive of a
Histogrm object. Note that we can set values into these bins (i.e., mutate the
list), only via __init__ and tally. So we call this information read-only: we
can read it but not write/change it (this class defines no __setitem__).

5) We use the now standard way to implement __iter__, by defining a local class
that defines __next__ and returning an object from that class. We will discuss
how changing self.histogram = histogram vs. self.histogram = list(histogram)
changes the iterator.

6) The __repr__ method doesn't know what numbers went into the bins, but we can
use the lowest number in each bin, repeated by the count in that bin, to specify
a list needed to construct an equivalent object (with the equivalent number of
values in each bin) with the construtor.

7) The __str__ method returns a two-dimensional plot of the histogram. Do you
all know how to use the format method for strings? If not you should look it
up (it is described online using something like EBNF) and practice using it. You
should certainly be able to tell me why the string that .format is called on
produces the result you'll see.

When Python executes the following script:

quiz1 = Percent_Histogram([50, 55, 70, 75, 85, 100])
quiz1.tally(20,30,95)
print(repr(quiz1))
for count in quiz1:
    print(count,end=' ')
print(quiz1)

It prints the following information:

Percent_Histogram([20, 30, 50, 50, 70, 70, 80, 90, 90])
0 0 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 2 
[ 0-  9] | 
[10- 19] | 
[20- 29] | *
[30- 39] | *
[40- 49] | 
[50- 59] | **
[60- 69] | 
[70- 79] | **
[80- 89] | *
[90-100] | **

Normally we would use this class in a program that reads a file of scores.
Now, what would happen if we executed the following code?

for count in quiz1:
    print(count,end=' ')
    quiz1.tally(100)

It would print: 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 11 (and after this point quiz1[9] is 12)

Note that mutating the quiz1 object during each iteration would result in the
new, accumulated values for the results produce by the iterator (in the last
bin). That is because the PH_iter object refers to (shares) the same list that
the Histogram class created (and that the tally method increments). So that
sharing results in the iterator always returning the most up-to-date value in
the list.

What if we wanted to have the iterator produce the values in the histogram WHEN
THE ITERATION STARTED, and not show any updates after that. The change is
trivial: in PH_iters's __iter__ method we change

                self.histogram =  histogram
to 
                self.histogram =  list(histogram)

Now instead of this iterator object sharing the list being using for the
histogram, it has its own copy: a new/different list, but storing all the
original list's values. So, changes to the original list will not change the
self.histogram list and therefore not change the result of the iteration. The
cost: extra space used for the list (not much, because the list always contains
just 10 values) and some extra time to construct the list.

So, we need to decide (and document) the semantics for our iterators. Can you
tell (and if so, with what code) what decision was made concerning this issues
for the list iterator, and discuss why you think the designers made that
decision?

In fact, because there are iterators for lists built-into Python, we could in
fact simplify __iter__ to delegate to the list class:

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.histogram)

for sharing behavior; and for copying behavior

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(list(self.histogram))

because the list class supports an __iter__ method, on whose result __next__
can be called. So defining and advancing our own indexes in the PH_iter class
is not strictly necessary. But this code illustrates how the actual list
iterator works (by remembering the index it is currently at)  and such
simplifications are not possible for other classes that store more complicated
data structures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterable Decorators: Classes that are initialized by/implement iterable

Since iterators are so important, it is useful to have a grab-bag of classes
(this lecture) and generators (next lecture) that operate on iterables to
produce more, slightly different iterables. When a class takes as an argument
an object that has methods implementing a certain protocol and returns an
object that has methods that implement the same protocol, the class is called a
DECORATOR. We will write a bunch of classes that decorate iterables below (and
even more in the next lecture). These are all pretty simple to think about, and
while the code is complicated, it is complicated in the same way each time.

In all these examples, we will not see an explicit "raise StopIteration";
instead, this exception is raised when calling next on the iterable it is
iterating over.

Here is a first example of a decorator for iterable and a refinement of it.
The Repeat class takes an iterable as an argument and implements an __iter__
method that repeats that iterator over and over: whenever it runs out of
values to produce, the entire sequence of values is produced again.

We can test this class with any iterable, and strings are the simplest, so we
will demonstrate this class using a string. If we run the script

for i in Repeat("abcde"):
    print(i,end=''))

Python would print: abcdeabcdeabcde ... and keep going forever; sometimes it
is useful to have an iterator go forever (typically there will be some if/break
in the loop using it, to eventually stop it).

Here is that class

class Repeat:
    def __init__(self,iterable):
        self.iterable = iterable
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Repeat_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable):
                self.iterable = iterable       # remember for restarting in next
                self.iterator = iter(iterable) # remember for direct use in next
            
            def __next__(self):
                try:
                    return next(self.iterator) # return next result in iterator
                except StopIteration:          # but if there is none...
                    self.iterator = iter(self.iterable) # restart iterable
                    return next(self)                   # recursive call of next
                                                        #  to restart it
        return Repeat_iter(self.iterable)

This uses the same define-a-class-in-the-__iter__-method used in the prange and
Histogram classes above.

We can generalize this class to Repeat an iterator either at most some fixed
number of times or forever, using the following class. If the second argument
to __init__ is an integer, it repeats the iterable at most that many times; if
there is no second argumment, the iterator repeats forever (as above).

class Repeat:
    def __init__(self,iterable,max_times=None):
        self.iterable  = iterable
        self.max_times = max_times
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Repeat_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable,max_times):
                self.iterable       = iterable
                self.max_times_left = max_times
                self.iterator       = iter(iterable)
            
            def __next__(self):
                if self.max_times_left != None and self.max_times_left = self.max_times:
                    answer = next(self.iterator)
                self.times[answer] += 1
                return answer

        return Unique_iter(self.iterable,self.max_times)

If we run the script:

for i in Unique('Mississippi',2):
    print(i,end='')

Python prints: Missipp

As another example, we will write the Filter class, which is supplied with
a predicate function (of one argument that returns a bool), indicating whether 
or note a value should be produced by the iterable or FILTERED OUT, causing
next to not return that value, but instead to keep looking at avluesn until it
finds a value to return that is ok by the predicate.

class Filter:
    def __init__(self,iterable,predicate):
        self.iterable  = iterable
        self.predicate = predicate
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Filter_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable,predicate):
                self.iterator  = iter(iterable)
                self.predicate = predicate
            
            def __next__(self):
	        answer = next(self.iterator)
		while self.predicate(answer) == False:
		    answer = next(self.iterator)
		return answer

        return Filter_iter(self.iterable,self.predicate)

If we run the script:

for i in Filter('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',lambda x : x not in 'richardpattis'):
    print(i,end='')           

Python prints all the letters not in my name: befgjklmnoquvwxyz 

Notice that the Repeat, Unique, and Filter classes all implement their iterators
similarly, with the same pattern of code. In the next lecture we will rewrite
these decorators -and even more decorators- much more simply using generators, 
which allow us to capture the pattern above much more easily -once we understand
how generators work.

Here is a last decorator for iterables. Its calls to next return all the values
in an iterable but in sorted order. In this implementation we collect all the
values from the iterator into a list and then sort the list and return its
iterator (since the values are all in the correct order). We cannot know what
smallest value to return until we have seen all the values.

class psorted: # pseudo-sorted: works just like sorted
    def __init__(self,iterable,key=None,reverse=False):
        self.result = list(iterable) # put all values in a list
        self.result.sort(key=key,reverse=reverse)
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.result)

Actually, "sorted" in Python is simpler: it is a function that returns a list
(so it still returns something that is iterable). So, psorted might be more
clearly written as

def psorted(iterable,key=None,reverse=False):
    result = list(iterable)                   # put all values in a list
    result.sort(key=key,reverse=reverse)      # calling sort returns None
    return result			      # so return in another statement

Finally, notice how we can combine these decorator classes below. Suppose I
want to print out all the letters in my name in alphabetical order, with no
repetition of letters. I can do it with the following script. Note that the
string argument to psorted is iteratble, and psorted itself returns an iterable
(so the argument to Unique is iterable) and finally Unique is iterable as well
(which is needed by the for loop)

for i in Unique(psorted('richardpattis')):
    print(i,end='')

It prints: acdhiprst

What would the following script print? It reverse the order of the classes
being constructed.

for i in psorted(Unique('richardpattis')):
    print(i,end='')


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems:

1) Explain what happens (and why) if we write the following loops

   for c in Repeat(''): ...?
   for c in Repeat('',4): ...?

each with an empty iterator (produces no values). Explain alternative (more
reasonable?) behavior and how we can implement it.

2) Explain what happens in each of the following situations, which uses a list
as the iterable being decorated: will the appended value be printed.

  l = [...] # some list
  i = 0
  for u in Unique(l):
      print(u)
      i += 1
      if i == 1:
          l.append(...) # append a value to l that is not already there

  l  = [...] # some list
  ui = Unique(l)
  l.append(...) # append a value to l that is not already there
  for u in ui:
      print(u)

Explain how we could modify the Unique class to get the opposite behavior.

3) Here is another way to write the __next__ method in the Filter_iter class.
Compare this loop with the one in the code above as to simplicity/clarity.

                while True:
                    answer = next(self.iterator)
                    if self.predicate(answer):
                        return answer

4) Expain why the iterable passed as an argument to the psorted class must
be finite. What is the difference between calling

for i in psorted(Repeat('abc')):
    print(i)

and 

for i in Unique(Repeat('abc')):
    print(i)

5) Define a preversed class similar to the sorted class above, which acts as a
decorator for iterables. You may not use reversed in your code. Hint: it uses
a combination of creating a list from the iterable and the iterator in the
Histogram class (although using a range iterator might simplify the code).

6) Define a Random class, which acts as a decorator for iterables: it returns
each value with a probability (a float between 0-never- and 1-always) specified
when the object is constructed. Account for the fact that the iterator might
produce an infinite number of values. Write this in a straightforward way, then
write it in a simpler way using the Filter class.

7) Define a Skipping class, which acts as a decorator for iterables: it skips
the first n values (n is specified as an argument to __init__) and then 
produces the same value as its iterable argument. So the following loop skips
the first three values when iteratin over the string 'abcdefg'

  for c in Skipping('abcdefg',3):
      print(c,end='')

and prints: defg
