 Selection time for menu items<body>
    Selection time for menu items       The 
time necessary to select an item i from a menu of length n is composed of the 
 search time S  plus         in 
the case of selection via a keyboard code: the time necessary to press the key(s);     
  in the case of selection with a pointing 
time: the  positioning time P , plus the activation time (e.g. the mouse 
click).          Search time S</strong>      </strong>

    There are three possible search strategies         
    (1) Serial inspection   
       (2) Random inspection without 
    repeat (implausible)      (3) 
    Random inspection with repeat   
      In 
all three cases, S is proportional to n. In case (3), both the expected means 
and the variance is higher than in (2) and (1).           1.2
          Advanced users</strong>   
    Advanced 
users remember the approximate position of frequently used items fairly well. 
The search time S then is nearly constant (i.e., independent of n).           
                    
The length of a menu influences the search time    only    
when the user is a beginner.   
                    The
      search time  of beginners    is
      likely to be shorter if frequently-used items are placed on top.
