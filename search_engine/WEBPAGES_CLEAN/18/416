Dynamic computational geometry
 
   Dynamic three-dimensional linear programming . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 91-53 , ICS, UCI, 1991.  32nd IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci., 
San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1991, pp. 488–494.  ORSA J. Computing  4: 360–368, 1992
(special issue on computational geometry).
 
Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
 linear programming 
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in " Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers ",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

    Offline algorithms for dynamic minimum spanning tree problems .

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  519, 1991, pp. 392–399.  Tech. Rep. 92-04 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  
 J. Algorithms  17: 237–250, 1994 .
 
Given a sequence of edge insertions and deletions in a graph,
finds the corresponding sequence of minimum spanning tree changes,
in logarithmic time per update.
Similarly solves the planar geometric version of the problem
(using a novel "mixed MST" formulation in which part of the input
is a graph and part is a point set) in time
O(log 2  n ) for the Euclidean metric and
O(log  n  log log  n ) for the rectilinear metric.

    Dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees and extrema of binary functions . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-05 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Tech. Rep. 92-88 , ICS, UCI, 1992.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  13: 111–122, 1995 .
 
Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
 minimum spanning tree  can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt  n ) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

The Tech. Report used the more informative title
"Updating widths and maximum spanning trees using the rotating caliper graph",
which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the  rotating caliper
graph  of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

    Computing the discrepancy .  
D. P. Dobkin  and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 47–52. 
 
Measures how well a sample of points from a set works as a discrete
approximation to the continuous measure of shapes in the set,
using algorithms based on Overmars and van Leeuwen's dynamic convex hull
data structure.
Some versions of the problem also involve subroutines
for finding the deepest point in an arrangement of quadrants or orthants.
  
This paper was merged with results of Mitchell to form the journal version,
" Computing the discrepancy with applications
to supersampling patterns ".

This paper shows how to use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " for some non-geometric problems including
hierarchical clustering,
 greedy matching ,
and  TSP heuristics .
Experiments show variants of my data structures to be faster than
previously used heuristics.

We use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " to detect collisions among a collection of moving
objects in sublinear time per collision.  As one application, we can
construct the  straight skeleton  of Aichholzer et al (and the mitered
offset curves from which it is defined) in subquadratic time.

    Incremental and decremental maintenance of planar width .

Baltimore, 1999, pp. S899-S900 .   J.

We show how to maintain the width of a planar point set, subject to
insertions or deletions (but not both) in time
O( n   c  ) per update for any  c  &gt; 0.
The idea is to apply our  dynamic closest pair
data structure  to an appropriate measure of distance between
pairs of convex hull features.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.
