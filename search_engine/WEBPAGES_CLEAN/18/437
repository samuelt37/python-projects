              Abstract   
This paper describes our entry for the MAP/MPE track of the PASCAL
2011 Probabilistic Inference Challenge, which placed first in all
three time limit categories, 20 seconds, 20 minutes, and 1 hour. Our
baseline is a branch-and-bound algorithm that explores the
context-minimal AND/OR search graph of a graphical model guided by a
mini-bucket heuristic. Augmented with recent advances that convert the
algorithm into an anytime scheme, that improve the heuristic power via
cost-shifting schemes, and using enhanced variable ordering schemes,
it constitutes one of the most powerful MAP/MPE inference methods to
date.
