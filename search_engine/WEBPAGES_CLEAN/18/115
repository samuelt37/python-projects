Real-world applications could benefit from the ability to automatically generate
a fine-grained ranking of photo aesthetics. However, previous methods for image
aesthetics analysis have primarily focused on the coarse, binary categorization of
images into high- or low-aesthetic categories.  In this work, we
propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network to rank photo
aesthetics in which the relative ranking of photo aesthetics are directly
modeled in the loss function. Our model incorporates joint learning of
meaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can help
regularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem.


 
 
To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics and attributes database (AADB)
which contains aesthetic scores and meaningful attributes assigned to each
image by multiple human raters. Anonymized rater identities are recorded across
images allowing us to exploit intra-rater consistency using a novel sampling
strategy when computing the ranking loss of training image pairs.  We show the
proposed sampling strategy is very effective and robust in face of subjective judgement of
image aesthetics by individuals with different aesthetic tastes. Experiments
demonstrate that our unified model can generate aesthetic rankings that are
more consistent with human ratings. To further validate our model, we show that
by simply thresholding the estimated aesthetic scores, we are able to achieve
state-or-the-art classification performance on the existing AVA dataset benchmark.
