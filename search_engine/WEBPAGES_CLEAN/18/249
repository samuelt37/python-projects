                             Oil painting on canvas, 2012 
                              No matter what is the color of my eyes or the shape of my nose. What matters is the inside! Dignity comes from the soal not the appearance! I love the qoute from Dr Seuss: "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."

                             Oil painting on small canvases, 2012 
                              This is the talking face of many of us when we go wrong. It says the majority of the face area is mouth. When he speaks a lot and listen less. Smallest portion of his life is dedicated to the brain. Although he has a right and truth eye, he sees with the black one and impact his brain as well. So the brain goes away from his truth prospective and obeys what the eye sees from the black view! He covers his ears with his hair, and he doesn't want to get to the light. He knows he doesn't know but he insists on being dumb!

                              The story of lovers using pallete knife. Depicting kindness with this harsh technique is one of my favorite mediums of art.

                             Oil painting on canvas 170x100cm, 2011 
                              I saw the model of this art piece at the Mr Katouzian's exhibition when I was 9 years old. I felt in love with the energy it gave me and I was so enthusiastic to paint this sometime in future when I improve my painting skills so I could paint that. I kept the image for few years and I finaly painted it when I was 19!

                               Taking digital stick figures to the real life is the story of Virtual Reality. When the glassy barrier between virtual and real life is broken and they become alive. This is the goal of Intelligent User Interface (IUI) Laboratory where I had been an intern. I was asked to visualize this goal so they can print it on mugs and give them to visitors of the lab as a gift. I involved all of my labmates including the advisor in the image and marked them by their names.

                              The story of a poor boy is depicted who doesn't have light in his life to brighten his hope with that, but he MADE one for himself. He drew the window of his dream on the obstacle of his way, so he could have the sun without sun setting for the source of his hope.

                               This was a joint project with one of the greatest poets in Iran. It was my honor to visualize his perspective for each of the peoms. I tried to camouglage as much meaning as possible in each of the drawings. As you may noticed, Leila, the main character of the book, appeared in the steam of the coffee. The left image is the cover of the book and the right image is one of the fifty drawings inside the book.

                               I painted this during my internship in San Fransicso. Sittting in front of the bridge and enjoying the beauty of God's painting and human's artpiece at the same time.
