  Hyperweb Manager Documentation  

 Background 

 The Hyperweb Manager is a system administration tool for the
management of Chimera 2.0 hyperwebs.  In addition, it tracks the
location of other Chimera 2.0 servers (such as the Hyperweb Server and
the Applet Server) running on the Hyperweb Manager's website. 

 The Hyperweb Manager provides operations to manipulate Chimera 2.0
hyperwebs. For instance, a user can use the Hyperweb Manager to create a
new hyperweb or delete an old one. In addition, the user can determine
if a Hyperweb Server is active for the website and connect or disconnect
one if required. Finally, a user can monitor a log of the Hyperweb
Manager's interactions with other Chimera 2.0 servers. 

 User-Interface 

 The Hyperweb Manager's user-interface is contained within a single
window that localizes its operations and status information. Each Menu
