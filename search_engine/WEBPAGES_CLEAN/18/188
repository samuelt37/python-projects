class OEMCSMaxBonds : public OEMCSFunc
   
The  OEMCSMaxBonds  class is an implementation of
 OEMCSFunc  designed to order maximum common substructure matches
by the maximum number of bonds included in the graph match.  If two
common structure matches have the same number of bonds, ties are split
based on the number of atoms contained in the match.

 
    
double operator()(const OEMolBase &amp;pattern,
                  const OEMolBase &amp;target,
                  OEAtomBase **atoms,
                  OEBondBase **bonds)
   
This method is called by its parent  OEMCSSearch  instance.  The
method is called with the pattern molecule, target molecule, and arrays
and atoms and bonds containing the correspondences found for the a
common structure match.  The method computes a value based on the
number of atoms and bonds in the common structure match which is used
to determine the maximum common structure match.

 
    
OEMCSFunc *CreateCopy() const
   
Deep copy constructor.  This method returns an  OEMCSMaxBonds 
instance.  The memory for the returned instance is allocated
dynamically.  The  operator delete  method should be called for
the returned instance to prevent a memory leak.
