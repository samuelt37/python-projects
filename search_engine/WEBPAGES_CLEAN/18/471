  Delaunay Triangulation 

The Delaunay triangulation of a point set is a collection of edges
satisfying an "empty circle" property: for each edge we can find
a circle containing the edge's endpoints but not containing any other points.
These diagrams their and their duals ( Voronoi
diagrams  and  medial axes )) have
been reinvented, given different names, generalized, studied, and
applied many times over in many different fields.  The Delaunay triangulation is also closely related by the so-called "lifting transformation" to
 convex hulls  in one higher dimension.
Many common methods for
 function interpolation  and
 mesh generation 
are based in some way on Delaunay triangulations, but there are
also many other ways in which this structure has been applied.
