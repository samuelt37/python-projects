 Menu-Based Interaction -- Overview<body>
    Menu dynamics     
          The 
menu item that is currently being touched by the cursor symbol should be highlighted.     
  Submenus of the currently touched menu 
item should be shown (30% less search time and 50% less errors for beginning users, 
Snowberry et al., 1985).            
  Selected options in the menu should 
remain checked.       It 
must be possible to leave the menu without selecting any item (since users may 
have erronously launched the menu, or just want to explore the system)                
    
  Positional constancy in menu entries 
is important. If an item is not available at the moment, it must nevertheless 
remain in the menu, but should be made less prominent (e.g., grey color)  Adding  contingent submenus is probably o.k. as long as visual changes are minor                            

     
    Menus 
should be easily visible against all possible backgrounds.
