                       CS 132 Course Policies   
                            
               
           
             Problem Sets:  
                  There will be six problem sets during the term. See the course outline for tentative assignment and due dates. All problem sets will be posted on the course web page.   
                    Problem sets  are due  at the beginning of class, and must be turned in either in lecture or to   the instructor's mailbox in 3019 Bren Hall.
                    No late homework will be accepted.   
                    Some problems on the problem set will be graded based on effort, but not on   the correctness of the answer. Other problems will be graded based both on   effort and on the knowledge demonstrated. It will not be announced beforehand   which problems fall into which category.   
                    Graded problem sets will normally be returned one week after the due date.   Solutions will be available online   when the problem sets are returned.   
                    Your lowest problem set score will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
                      Project:  
                There will be one project to be completed during the second half of the term. It will be on a topic of your choice, based on something we cover in class. Typically, this will focus on one technology or one type of application. 
                 Projects will be done in groups of 3 students. You must form your group and choose a topic by May 6. 
                 Some projects will be chosen for presentation to the class during the last two weeks of the quarter. Others will turn in a report. 
                 See the  project webpage  for details. 
                   Grading Policy:  
              Letter grades are based on the instructor's   evaluation of your demonstrated performance in the course. An overall score in   the course will be calculated using the following weighting:
                Problem Sets (25%)
                    Project (35%) 
                   Final (40%)  
                No absolute scale will be used in assigning letter grades to each overall   score. Instead, the instructor will use his judgment to decide what letter grade   is appropriate for each overall score range. The instructor reserves the right   to override this policy in individual cases where the student has demonstrated   mastery of the material on the final, but this is rare. 
               All grades (problem sets, project, final, and the final course letter grade) will be   available through eee.uci.edu.

                     Plagiarism Leaning Module, and reports of incidents .
                    On problem sets, you are strongly encouraged to work in groups to discuss   your  approach  to solving each problem, but you must work individually in   progressing from that point toward the solution. You must turn in  only  your own work. Use of any solutions from any source other than a student's own   work is considered plagiarism. 
                   On the project, the work presented is expected to represent the participation of all members of the group. Anything that is other than the group's own   work must be properly cited or it is considered plagiarism. 
                   Students agree that by taking this   course all required papers are subject to submission for textual similarity   review to Turnitin.com for the detection of plagiarism.  All submitted papers   will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database   solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of the   Turnitin.com service is subject to the Usage Policy agreement posted on the   Turnitin.com site. 
                     Add Drop Policy:

                     ICS add/drop policies 
                    Course add/drop policy: The instructor normally only allows additions to the   course, as space allows, until the end of week 1.  
                 Attendance Policy:  
                Attendance at project presentations is expected. Students are responsible for all material covered in all lectures, and the   instructor will not provide notes. Posted lecture slides will be missing some key material.
                    To be respectful to your classmates, please turn off cell phones when in the   classroom, and avoid discussion that is not part of classroom activity.
