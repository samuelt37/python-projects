	        This quarter (Winter 2017), I am teaching
		   CS 263, analysis of algorithms  
		  CS 269, theory seminar  
		  Courses I have offered in other quarters: 
                   ICS 1F, computability 
		(last offered W98) 
		  US 3, cellular automata 
		(last offered W07) 
                  ICS 161, design and analysis of
                algorithms 
		(last offered F16) 
                  ICS 162, formal languages and
		automata 
		(last offered F03) 
		  CS 163 / CS 265, graph algorithms 
		(last offered S16) 
                  CS 164, computational geometry 
		(last offered S14) 
		  ICS 180, game programming
		project  (last offered W99) 
                  ICS 260, fundamentals of
		algorithms 
		(last offered F02) 
		  ICS 261, graduate data structures 
		(last offered W16) 
		  CS 266,  computational geometry 
		(last offered S14) 
		 
		In addition I have occasionally offered graduate seminars,
                under the ICS 280 and CS 295 course numbers, but with
		a different topic each time; past topics include
                 mesh generation  (S97),
                 computational statistics  (S99),
                 exponential algorithms  (F00),
		and
		 geometric graph algorithms  (W07 and S08).
