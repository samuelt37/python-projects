&gt; 1) you want to send in updates for different resources (e.g. a file AND its
&gt; ancillary images, all modified in the meantime), and want a single commit
&gt; for all of them -- and this is, I understand, *evil*.

Yes. Is Good. Is Excellent, Even. Not Evil. Not Bad.

&gt; 2) you want to send in several updates for the same resource: e.g. I check
&gt; out a file for the weekend on my laptop, create locally several versions --
&gt; friday night, saturday afternoon just before the party, and sunday evening
&gt; because I'm bored -- and check them back in first thing monday morning as a
&gt; single connection, with the different parts representing the different
&gt; versions that were created locally. -- This was considered an interesting
&gt; option for VTML, and one of the main reasons for external deltas.

This is nice, too. I'm not sure about the locking semantics, though.
