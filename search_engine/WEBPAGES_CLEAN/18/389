       Ecological Intervention 
	 Peer
into the rainforests of Costa Rica through the windows of three
standing islands. They are lush environments, populated by flowering
plants and trees, as well as a multitude of hummingbirds. 
	     
	 As a visitor, you have control over the islands' ecosystems - you can destroy everything on an island at the push 
of a button, leaving it barren and uninhabited. 
	     
	 Participate
in restoration ecology by moving new species to the deforested island.
Use the mobile rafts to pick up a seed or bird from one island and
deposit it on another. 
	     
	 By
introducing new species to an island, you affect the island's
ecosystem. Each species brings a different quality to the island; you
must make them work together in the correct order to restore the island
to its original state. 
	      
 
  Once an island has been restored, the various species interact to form a thriving ecosystem.

         A Museum Near You 
       On July 26 and August 19, 2005, the EcoRaft Project team took the prototype installation to the  Discovery Science Center 
in Santa Ana, California, for a two hour test run. In the future, we
hope to install a version of it permanently at this location and other
similar sites around the United States. Check this space for future
notices.
