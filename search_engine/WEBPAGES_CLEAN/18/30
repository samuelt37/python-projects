         DANN data

The raw data can be found here &lt;http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/martin/download/cadd_training/&gt;. The real SNV, insertion and deletion samples sum up to 16,627,775. We randomly sample equal number of simutation samples (SNV, insertion and deletion), combine with the real data, and get a dataset of 33,255,550 samples.

         Welcome to the lab for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics at School of Information and Computer Sciences of  University of California, Irvine!   



Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, computer vision and NLP.
