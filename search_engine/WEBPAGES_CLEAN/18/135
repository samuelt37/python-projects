 ICS 10A Review Topics * Fall 2003<body>
  
 
   As originally scheduled, the ICS 10A final
exam will be given on Thursday, December 11, from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. in
our regular classroom, SE II 1304.
 
The exam will cover the entire course.  It will emphasize topics from lecture
and from the assignments.  Below is a list of the major topics from the
course.  While we can't guarantee that every single fact on the exam
will be listed below, we have made the list as comprehensive as possible
and no major topic area is omitted.  The form of the exam will be very similar
to the form of the midterm and sample midterm, though the final will be
a little longer (since you have 120 minutes instead of 80).
 
We will supply a copy of the Deus X instruction set with the final exam,
as we did with the midterm.  In addition, you may bring with you one page
(8.5 by 11 inches, both sides) of notes, on which you may place any information
you think will help you on the exam.  You may also bring a conventional
calculator (no PDAs or cellphones), but be careful to read the questions
carefully; some of them, for example, may require spreadsheet formulas rather
than numeric calculations.
