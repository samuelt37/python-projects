  Definition 
 

The function   ch_jarvis   generates the counterclockwise sequence of extreme
points from a given set of input points.
  

 #include &lt; CGAL/ch_jarvis.h &gt; 
  

    
         
    template &lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class Traits&gt;
         
            
           
OutputIterator
         
          
             
     ch_jarvis  (     
    InputIterator first, 

InputIterator beyond, 

OutputIterator result, 

Traits ch_traits = Default_traits)     
                
    generates the counterclockwise sequence of extreme points
            of the points in the range [ first , beyond ).
            The resulting sequence is placed starting at position
             result , and the past-the-end iterator for the resulting
            sequence is returned. It is not specified at which point the
            cyclic sequence of extreme points is cut into a linear sequence.  Precondition:  The source range [ first , beyond ) does not contain
             result .
            

The default traits class  Default_traits  is the kernel in which the
type  InputIterator::value_type  is defined.
  

  Requirements 
   InputIterator::value_type  and 
             OutputIterator::value_type 
            are equivalent to  Traits:: Point_2  .
      Traits  defines the following subset of types from
            the concept  ConvexHullTraits_2  and their corresponding member
            functions that return instances of these types:
               Traits:: Point_2  ,
		   Traits::Equal_2 ,
                   Traits::Less_rotate_ccw_2 ,
                   Traits::Less_xy_2 .

  Implementation This function uses the Jarvis march (gift-wrapping)
algorithm [ Jar73 ]. This algorithm requires  O(n h)  time 
in the worst case for  n  input points with  h  extreme points.
