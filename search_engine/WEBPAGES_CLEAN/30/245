Developing Novel Statistical Methods in NeuroImaging 
 
  
July 24-26, 2012 
 
(immediately preceding the Joint Statistical Meeting 2012)
 
  
University of California at San Diego
 
  

   
 
The goal of the workshop is to identify open problems in statistical research that emerge from current challenges in neuroimaging. 
 

 
The analysis of brain data presents statistical challenges because of its massiveness, high dimensionality and complex spatio-temporal dependence structure. We expect to see open lines of statistical research especially in the areas of time series, spatial analysis, dimension reduction, statistical learning, functional data analysis, statistical computation and foundations of statistical inference. At the workshop, leaders in neuroimaging will deliver lectures on theoretical background in neuroscience and in the state-of-the-art statistical methods for the analysis of brain imaging data. The workshop topic is timely due to the increased role of late of mathematical and statistical methods in neuroimaging.
