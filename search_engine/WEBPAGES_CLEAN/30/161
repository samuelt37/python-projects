We show that the maximum flow problem can be solved in near-linear time
for K 5 -minor-free and K 3,3 -minor-free graphs. The
same result also holds for H-minor-free graphs when H can be embedded in
the plane with one crossing and a structural decomposition of the input
flow graph is given.
  
    Drawing graphs in the plane with a prescribed outer face and
polynomial area .  E. Chambers ,

 M. T. Goodrich , and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6502, 2011, pp. 129–140 .  arXiv:1009.0088 .   J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications  16 (2): 243–259, 2012 .
 
Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.
