				 Abstract 
				 


				 

  Motivation : The use of computer models for the understanding of biomolecular systems is increasingly important. Multicellular models are especially useful in the context of developmental biological systems.
   Results : We show how a simple model of gene regulatory networks combined with models of signaling and cell division can be used to simulate behavior of a real biological system, the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana.
