  October 30, 1998:  Regression Depth and
Center Points   David Eppstein , ICS, UC Irvine 

 We show that, for any set of  n  points in  d 
dimensions, there exists a hyperplane with regression depth at
least ceiling( n /( d +1)), as had been conjectured by
Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any arrangement of  n 
hyperplanes in  d  dimensions there exists a point that cannot
escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling( n /( d +1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our
approach to related questions on the existence of partitions of the
data into subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression
depth in each subset, and to the computational complexity of
regression depth problems. 

 This is joint work with Nina Amenta, Marshall Bern and Shang-Hua
Teng.
