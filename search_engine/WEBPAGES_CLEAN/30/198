    Attending my first ever research conference  #ICSE2012  and  #MSR2012  at Zurich, Switzerland! — Vijay Krishna Palepu (@vkpalepu)  June 2, 2012  

 ICSE and MSR 2012 was a sweet experience where i actually got to learn from a constant stream of knowledge from the researchers themselves, as against a 10 page research paper. This was also the first time where i was able to put a face to the N-number of software engineering papers that i had been reading over the last one year. And yes, Zurich was a lovely place to visit, even if it was packed with attending research talks.
