Origami
 
The Japanese art of paper folding is obviously geometrical in nature.
Some origami masters have looked at constructing geometric figures such
as regular polyhedra from paper.  In the other direction, some people have
begun using computers to help fold more traditional origami
designs.  This idea works best for tree-like structures, which can be
formed by laying out the tree onto a paper square so that the vertices
are well separated from each other, allowing room to fold up the
remaining paper away from the tree.  Bern and Hayes (SODA 1996) asked,
given a pattern of creases on a square piece of paper, whether one can
find a way of folding the paper along those creases to form a flat
origami shape; they showed this to be NP-complete.  Related theoretical
questions include how many different ways a given pattern of creases
can be folded, whether folding a flat polygon from a square always
decreases the perimeter, and whether it is always possible to fold a
square piece of paper so that it forms (a small copy of) a given flat
polygon.

    The Margulis Napkin Problem .
Jim Propp asked for a proof that the perimeter of a flat origami
figure must be at most that of the original starting square.
Gregory Sorkin provides a simple example showing that on the contrary,
the perimeter can be arbitrarily large.
