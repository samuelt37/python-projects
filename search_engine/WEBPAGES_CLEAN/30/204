        Getting Started with DataGuard 

    	    System requirements 
    		 
    			Check out this list before you go have fun with it:
    		 
    		  Java Platform Standard Edition Runtime Environment Version 6.0 or above. 
    		  

    	    The MasterPassword 



    			DataGuard defends your data and your privacy. All your data is encrypted and is accessible
only to you. The overall security provided by dataGuard is controlled by only one strong
    			secret called the master password. So, after you open the program, the first operation is to set the
master password using
    			the Main Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; MasterPassword. Once the master password is created, it is time to
    			use dataGuard. Do not forget your master password, because next time you start the program
    			you will need to remember the same secret.



    	 

    	    Using DataGuard 


    			When you start DataGuard, the right view contains the list, with a brief description, of
    			the translational layers currently implemented. You can use any of the layers just by clicking on them.
    			DataGuard will show a friendly and pretty self-explanatory login dialog, where you have to
    			insert your username and password. DataGuard assumes that you are already registered with the translation layer that you have chosen.
                  Once logged to the service, the remote file system will be shown in a separate tab.


    	 

    	    Remote View 

    		 
	    		For each translational layer DataGuard provides a view similar to the one
	    		provided by the modern operating systems. Using the view you can perform
		    	all the commons file system operation, like create files and directories, cut, copy
		    	and paste of file and directories, rename, delete, etc.
    		 
    	 

    	    Search Function 

    		 
    			File systems allow users to search for documents that contain a particular keyword.
    			Hence, DataGuard proposes a novel index based approach for executing keyword
    			based queires at the server. Using the search pane, DataGuard allows users to execute metadata
    			and content queries.
