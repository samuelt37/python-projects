  Things we would like to know  
      What are the set of possible architectural configurations that might occur?
 
     Do any of these configurations violate style constraints?
 
     Can reconfiguration disrupt computations resulting in deadlocks, lost messages, etc.?
 
     Is the dynamic system equivalent to some other static system?
