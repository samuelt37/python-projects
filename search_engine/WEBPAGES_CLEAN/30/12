         Web series featuring college students' STEM inventions readies for second season</strong>
           By Alex Chan</strong>
                    
After wrapping up its first season two months ago, a web series that spotlights student innovators is gearing up for Season 2.

  
"STEMbility" was launched in September by several students from UC Irvine, Orange Coast College and Irvine Valley College.

  
The first season, which aired on YouTube, followed four college students as they brainstormed ideas for inventions related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, and eventually executed their visions.

  
Students from across Southern California were welcome to apply.

  
"'STEMbility' started not for the purpose of 'fixing' the traditional educational system but rather to supply what is missing," said "STEMbility's" president, Andres Vourakis, a UCI computer science student. "Our mission is to help undergraduate students acquire the technical and entrepreneurial skills they need to succeed after college using a project-based learning approach, while inspiring others through our web series."
