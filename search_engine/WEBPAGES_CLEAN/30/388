  The seminar will focus on current issues in the following areas: 

   Probabilistic networks and constraint networks: Inference and modeling, focusing on application areas such as planning, scheduling and diagnosis. 
 Planning and reasoning under unceratainty. We will look into models such as Markov decision processes (MDP's) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). 
   Students will be encouraged to find a research project
around which they will read, present and discuss current papers.
