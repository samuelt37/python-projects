 Given that a word processor such as Microsoft Word supports these rich collaborative authoring features, does it necessarily make sense that Internet standards should support them all? First of all, there may be relevant differences between traditional word-processing documents and Web pages, just in the type of document they are. I�m not sure about this point, but I thought I�d throw it out for consideration. I can think of plenty of differences between the types of documents that users save in Word format vs. HTML, but I�m not sure that these differences are relevant for this purpose. 

  

 The next issue is very real, and that�s the network. There are things we can get away with on a LAN, both with respect to speed and security, that we can�t get away with on the Internet. This might change how we do a lot of things.
