              Abstract   

 

We report the PASCAL2 benchmark for DAOOPT and GUROBI on MPE task
with 330 optimally solved instances from 8 benchmark domains. DAOOPT outperformed
GUROBI in 3 domains, while GUROBI was faster than DAOOPT in
the rest of the 5 domains. We show that DAOOPT performed well in domains
where it could have high quality initial solutions for pruning the AND/OR search
space, or skip search when the heuristic upper bounds were converged to the optimal
due to MPLP/JGLP algorithms. GUROBI presented excellent performance if
cutting planes were applied progressively and its heuristic algorithms could find
the optimal solution at the root of branch-and-cut tree.
