 Cutset Sampling with Likelihood Weighting 

 Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper extends the principle of cutset
sampling over Bayesian networks, presented
previously for Gibbs sampling, to likelihood
weighting (LW). Cutset sampling is motivated
by the Rao-Blackwell theorem which
implies that sampling over a subset of variables
requires fewer samples for convergence
due to the reduction in sampling variance.
The scheme exploits the network structure
in selecting cutsets that allow efficient computation
of the sampling distributions. In
particular, as we show empirically, likelihood
weighting over a loop-cutset (abbreviated
LWLC), is time-wise cost-effective. We
also provide an effective way for caching
the probabilities of the generated samples
which improves the performance of the overall
scheme. We compare LWLC against regular
liklihood-weighting and against Gibbsbased
cutset sampling.
