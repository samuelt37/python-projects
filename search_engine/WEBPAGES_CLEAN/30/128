   Two results on 3d lattice embedding of graphs
 
 
Prof. David Eppstein, UC Irvine  


 
I'll present the results from two of my papers at Graph Drawing 2008: 
"Isometric diamond subgraphs", about embedding graphs into the three-dimensional diamond 
lattice, and "The topology of three-dimensional bendless orthogonal graph drawing", 
about embedding graphs into space in such a way that three mutually orthogonal 
edges meet at each vertex.
