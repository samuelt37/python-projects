Pooling second-order local feature statistics to form a high-dimensional
bilinear feature has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of fine-grained classification tasks.  To address the computational
demands of high feature dimensionality, we propose to represent the covariance
features as a matrix and apply a low-rank bilinear classifier.  The resulting
classifier can be evaluated without explicitly computing the bilinear feature
map which allows for a large reduction in the compute time as well as
decreasing the effective number of parameters to be learned.



 
To further compress the model, we propose classifier co-decomposition that
factorizes the collection of bilinear classifiers into a common factor and
compact per-class terms.  The co-decomposition idea can be deployed through two
convolutional layers and trained in an end-to-end architecture.  We suggest a
simple yet effective initialization that avoids explicitly first training and
factorizing the larger bilinear classifiers.  Through extensive experiments, we
show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public
datasets for fine-grained classification trained with only category labels.
Importantly, our final model is an order of magnitude smaller than the recently
proposed compact bilinear model, and three orders smaller
than the standard bilinear CNN model.
