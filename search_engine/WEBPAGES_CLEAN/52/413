The web versioning home page
	 http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/arch/ 

should have a link to the OpenText livelink page
( http://www.opentext.com/livelink/ll_library.html ) that talks about
version management in LiveLink. Reading the press releases and
technical material on the site makes it hard to discern the actual
technology used, but at least the pictures and text make it look like
an interesting contender, and the requirements documents there might
well match some of the requirements we want to see in any standard for
version management in web sites.
