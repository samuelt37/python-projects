  A Bridging Model for Parallel Computation, Communication, and I/O 

 
The past decade has seen the introduction of new and useful models for
analyzing the computational and communication complexities of parallel
algorithms, as well as useful models to measure I/O complexity.  Yet
no useful model measures all of computational, communication, and I/O
complexity simultaneously.

  
Usefulness of a model implies two characteristics.  First, the model
should be realistic in the sense that its prediction for any algorithm
should correspond to observed behavior of real systems.  Second, the
model should be simple enough to use and understand that one can
design, analyze, and implement algorithms without having had extensive
experience with the model.

  
We maintain that the Bulk Synchronous Parallel, or BSP, model  [Valiant 1990]  and LogP  [Culler et al. 1993]  models are
useful for computational and communication complexities of parallel
algorithms.  The Parallel Disk Model, or PDM,  [Vitter Shriver 1994]  is useful for I/O
complexity.  The BSP and LogP models, however, ignore I/O, and the PDM
does not account for computation or communication.  Because we think
of I/O as so much slower than computation or communication, the PDM
apparently captures the most salient factor in the wall-clock time for
algorithms that use parallel I/O.

  
What is apparent may not be the case, however.

  
 Early experiences  with algorithms
implemented in the PDM indicate that although wall-clock time for a
given algorithm follows the prediction of the model, the algorithms
themselves are not I/O bound.  Even with synchronous (i.e., blocking)
I/O, the time spent waiting for I/O is typically less than 50% of the
total wall-clock time.  This behavior suggests that each parallel disk
access gives rise to a given amount of computation and communication
for a particular algorithm.

  
A sorting algorithm, for example, might repeatedly process
"memoryloads" of data by performing a large parallel read, an
in-memory sort across all processors, and a large parallel write.  The
time to perform the in-memory sorts might exceed the combined times of
the parallel reads and writes, although it is roughly the same among
the memoryloads.  Typical algorithms developed for the PDM are similar
to this hypothetical sorting algorithm in that they make repeated
passes over the data and each pass repeatedly reads in a large amount
of data, processes it, and writes out a large amount of data.
Processing time (including communication) tends to be about the same
each time for a given algorithm.  Of course it varies from algorithm
to algorithm.

  
If these early observations continue to hold as we gain more
experience in implementing algorithms for the PDM, we will draw the
conclusion that the PDM's predictive power is helpful (for analyzing
I/O time) but limited (by omitting computation and communication).

  
Note, however, a striking similarity between the BSP model and typical
PDM algorithms: bulk processing.  In the BSP model, for example,
communcation in a network of processors is considered to be the prime
computational bottleneck; hence, a computation is organized as a
sequence of rounds, where each round consists of each processor
performing computations on its internal memory, followed by the
sending and receiving of a limited number of messages.  Rounds and
communication in BSP algorithms are like memoryload processing and
I/O, respectively, in PDM algorithms.

  
The challenge, therefore, is to synthesize a coherent model that
combines the best aspects of the PDM and BSP models to develop and
analyze algorithms that use parallel I/O, computation, and
communication.  Along with such a model, we need programming
primitives to enable algorithm implementation under the model.  These
primitives must be portable and have performance matching the model's
requirements.

  
We view developing such a model as a challenge because we believe that
it will be difficult to simultaneously satisfy the two requirements
that it be realistic yet easy to use.  Our concern is that a realistic
model may have so many parameters as to make it unusable.  The PDM,
without considering processing, has four parameters: problem size,
memory size, disk block size, and disk count.  The BSP model also has
four parameters: problem size, processor count, latency of the
network, and the "gap" time between consecutive messages in pipelined
computations.  Thus, some natural questions to ask include the
following:
   Can all these parameters be merged in some synthesis?  

  Is there a block size notion in BSP that might be consistent with
the PDM'S block size?

  What is the right set of at most four or five important parameters?
   
In summary, we think that it would be valuable to propose a bridging
parallel computational model that incorporates computation,
communication and I/O in an accurate and easy to use manner.  We hope
that discussions at the workshop will lead to such a model.
