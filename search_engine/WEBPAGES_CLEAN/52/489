        My research is in computational vision, in particular how to integrate
        mechanisms for  visual
        recognition and perceptual organization  with 3D scene understanding.
        We apply these computational models to a variety of problems including 
         forensic science  and
        biological imaging.  We have substantially on developing tools for   biological image and shape analysis  in
        order to measure morphology and spatial patterns of gene expression in
        neuroscience and animal development.
