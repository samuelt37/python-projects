10.4 Making Hydrogen Atoms Implicit 
 

 
A molecule which contains explicit hydrogens may be converted to a
hydrogen suppressed graph using the  OESuppressHydrogens 
function.  The  OESuppressHydrogens  function deletes all
explicit hydrogens in the molecule.  The implicit hydrogen count
fields of the remaining atoms are incremented by the number of
previously attached explicit hydrogens which have been deleted.  The
valence state of the remaining atoms is preserved by the retention of
implicit hydrogen counts.
