  As a start,
  we must say what this inquiry is about
  and to what subject it belongs;
  namely,
  that it is concerned with
   the way in which conclusions are to be established 
  and belongs to the science of their establishment.

  Argumentation 
   
    the process of making a claim,
    challenging another's claim,
    backing up claim,
    or rebutting a claim. 
   
   Reasoning 
   
    the process of presenting reasons supporting a claim. 
   
   Argument 
   
    a connected chain of claims and reasons. 
    If the connected chain hangs together
    to support the claim,
    then the argument is  sound . 
   
   Rational 
   
    describing someone who is open to argument,
    as opposed to deaf to argument. 
   
  
The basic parts of a simple structured argument are
 25 : 
 
  a claim 
   
    The statement whose truth is asserted; 
    the goal the argument is directed towards.
   
   grounds 
   
    What is needed to support the claim.
   
   warrant 
   
    Justification that this claim in fact follows from these grounds.
   
   backing 
   
    Support for the validity of the warrant in the current context.
   
  
Roles in fruitful reasoning are  29 : 
 
  
    the  claimant 
    who makes a well-defined claim,
    and
   
   
    the  interrogator 
    who elicits information needed for him or her to be convinced
    of the claim. 
   
  
If the claim is ambiguous (could be interpreted in more than one way),
or otherwise unclear,
the interrogator won't be able to be convinced. 
The claimant's first task is to make a clear, unambiguous claim
 31 . 
 

 An example dialogue of reasoning 

    The claimant makes a  claim .
     
       
     The interrogator questions whether this claim is true.
     
     The claimant produces  grounds  for the claim
      (perhaps a single ground, perhaps several grounds).
     
       
     The interrogator questions whether these grounds
      support the claim. 
      After all,
        
          the grounds might not be  relevant  to the truth of the claim,
          or
         
         
          the grounds might not be  sufficient 
          to show the truth of the claim. 
         
        
       
     The claimant produces a  warrant 
      that the claim follows from the grounds.
     
     The interrogator questions whether this warrant is valid. 
      After all,
        
          the warrant might not be  relevant  to these grounds and claim,
          or
         
         
          the warrant might not be  sufficient 
          in the context of this argument. 
         
        
       
     The claimant produces  backing  for the warrant
      (a single backing, or several backings all supporting its validity).
     
     The interrogator questions whether the backing
      supports this warrant. 
      After all,
        
          the backing might not be  relevant  to the truth of this warrant,
          or
         
         
          the backing might not be  sufficient 
          to support the claimed strength of the warrant
          (see
           Qualifying the strength of an argument ). 
         
        
      
If the interrogator is still unconvinced,
the claimant can present a secondary argument
in support of the backing (or, earlier, the grounds)
by chaining the two arguments together.

    Figure 2.  Sub-argument for ground (1) of initial argument
   75 
   
 

 Chaining arguments together 

 
The claimant can  chain 
arguments to support the claim more convincingly  73 : 
 
  
    by treating the grounds as a claim that needs to be supported,
    and then constructing an argument supporting it
    (with secondary grounds, warrant, and backing); 
    or
   
   
    by treating the backing as a claim that needs to be supported,
    and then constructing an argument supporting it
    (with secondary grounds, warrant, and backing); 
   
  
 Figure 1 
shows an initial argument,
and
 Figure 2 
shows a sub-argument
supporting Ground (1) of the initial argument. 
 Figure 3 
shows how the two arguments chain together. 
(All example arguments here are from
 Toulmin, Rieke, and Janik .)

  Figure 6.  An argument limited by a qualifier and three rebuttals
   125 
   
 

 
So far we have been considering only whether
an argument is sound or not. 
If the required logical connections are present,
the argument is sound; 
if not, the argument is unsound. 
There's no in between. 
 

 
    
  Figure 7.  An argument limited by a qualifier and a rebuttal
   125 
   
 

 
But an argument may be sound
and yet not be completely convincing. 
In this case, we are interested in the
 strength  of the argument. 
This is typically expressed by a
 qualifier 
( Figure 4 ),
which is an adverb or adverbial phrase
like one of the following  81 : 
 

   Necessarily
   
    Certainly
   
    Presumably
   
    In all probability
   
    So far as the evidence goes
   
    For all that we can tell
   
    Very likely
   
    Very possibly
   
    Maybe
   
    Apparently
   
    Plausibly
   
    Seemingly
   
  
A second way an argument may be restricted in its strength
is that it may only apply in certain contexts. 
A  rebuttal 
gives a specific condition
under which the argument is not valid
( Figure 6 )  95 . 
 
 
Note that typically
the presence of a rebuttal
is what causes a qualifier to be necessary. 
 

 
Figures  6  and  7 
show example arguments with qualifiers and rebuttals. 
 


  Argument
  as a guide to choosing among claims 

 
So far we've looked at argumentation
as a way of constructing and assessing
an argument in favor of a specific claim. 
Now we will look at argumentation
as a means of choosing among
several alternative claims. 
 
 
Suppose you need to take a convincing position on some question,
or to choose among several possible positions. 
How might you go about it? 
 
   Choose the position which seems most promising; 
    make that your claim. 
   
    Construct an argument supporting that claim. 
   
    Is the argument convincing? 
        No, the argument isn't convincing.   Why not? 
            The claim is correct, but
            your argument is not as convincing as it could be.  
               Examine your argument's structure,
                find out where it is weak,
                strengthen it,
                and try again at step 3. 
               
                If that doesn't seem to be helping,
                return to step 2 and
                try a different argument. 
               
              
            Or...
             
           
             The claim is not correct 
            (so no correctly-structured argument for it will be convincing). 
            Return to step 1 and try again with a different claim. 
             
            (You might look at the structure of your unconvincing arguments
            for help seeing how the claim might be made broader or more exact,
            so that a convincing argument could be made.) 
             
           
          
         The argument is only somewhat convincing.   Now what? 
            The claim is correct, but
            your argument is only somewhat as strong as it could be.  
             
            Examine your argument's structure,
            find out where it is weak,
            strengthen it,
            and try again at step 3. 
             
             
            Or...
             
           
             The claim is only somewhat correct,  so
            no correctly-structured argument
            could make it completely convincing. 
             
            Look at the structure of your only-somewhat-convincing arguments
            for help seeing how the claim might be made broader or more exact,
            so that a convincing argument could be made. 
            Return to step 2 and try again with this improved claim. 
             
           
          
         Yes, thank goodness, the argument is convincing.  
        Are you done? 
           Not if
            another even more convincing argument exists for your claim. 
             
            If so,
            figure out what that argument would be, and try again
            at step 3. 
             
           
            Not if
            an even broader or more exact claim exists
            for which a more convincing argument can be made. 
             
            If so,
            figure out what that claim would be, and try again
            at step 2. 
             
           
            If your claim is the broadest and most exact
            and your argument for it is the most convincing,
            then you are done. 
             
            There is no way you can be completely sure about this
            (it's like testing: 
            testing can find bugs, but not show the absence of bugs). 
            The best way seems to be
            to try several claims
            (as many as you have patience for),
            and for each claim try several arguments (see the steps above). 
             
           
          
      
  Argument
  as a guide to improving the thing about which you claim something 

 
So far we've seen argument structure from the point of view
of a claimant desiring to convince an interrogator
of a specific claim. 
Now we will look at argument structure
as a means of improving the the entity about which something is claimed,
by changing that entity so it better supports the claim: 
 
   By revising the claim to something for which the entity supports
    a better argument;
   
    By altering the entity to provide better grounds for the claim;
   
    By altering the entity to provide grounds for which
    a better warrant exists;
   
    By altering the entity to provide stronger backing
    for the warrant relating its grounds to the claim; 
    or
   
    By altering the entity in order to
    eliminate one or more rebuttals. 
   
  
 Haley, Moffett, Laney, and Nuseibeh 
take a similar approach for security requirements,
in which they use argumentation
to identify factors essential for security.
