  W-SEARCH 
    W-SEARCH implements several AND/OR search algorithms that use weighted heuristics to produce a w-optimal approximate solution to a most probable explanation problem in Bayesian or Markov networks in an anytime manner.      
  Author 
    Radu_Marinescu  and  Natalia Flerova  (using the heuristic by  Alex Ihler  and algorithm BRAOBB by  Lars Otten ).       
  Description 
     The following weighted heuristic algorithms are implemented: w-AOBF (in parameters choose aow), wR-AOBF (araobf), wAOBB (waobb) and wBRAOBB (wbraobb). Also the usual AOBF, AOBB and BRAOBB schemes are available. These are anytime algorithms that output a sequence of solutions, each of which is guaranteed to be w-optimal, namely to be within a factor of weight from the optimal (on logarithmic scale). When the weight becomes equal 1 the solution if optimal.         The following weight policies are implemented, where k and d are integer input parameters, Wj is the weight at iteration j and W(j-1) is the weight at the previous iteration. The starting weight W0 is defined as an input parameters.      substract(K): Wj = W(j−1) − K     divide(K): Wj = W(j−1)/K     inverse: Wj = W1/j     piecewise(K, D): if Wj ≥ D then Wj = W0 /j, else Wj = W(j−1)/K     sqrt(K): Wj =sqrt(W(j−1)/K)        
  Input format 
     The graphical model instance has to be specified in the  UAI file format .       
  Output 
     The output of the algorithm is the sequence of approximate solutions to the MPE problem on log scale (-log10(UB)) and corresponding weights, reported in anytime manner.
