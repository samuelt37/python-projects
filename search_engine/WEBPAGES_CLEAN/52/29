      Undeclared Pre-Major 
                
        New freshmen who want to explore their interests in computer science and information technology before committing to a specific major may apply as ICS Undeclared.  
           
        This option gives freshmen all the benefits of being a Bren School student. An academic counselor will help you structure a first-year course plan that meets your interests and includes a core set of lower-division computer science and math courses common to all the majors. You'll learn what the Bren School majors are like and will transfer into a specific major before the start of your second year.  
           
        Note that students interested in the Computer Science and Engineering degree program are strongly encouraged to start as a CSE major at the time they enter UCI, as the major is highly structured.
