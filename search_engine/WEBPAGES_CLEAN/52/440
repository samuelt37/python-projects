					  This pattern 
					was discovered by N. Beluchenko, 2005. 

					 It repeats every 6 generations,
					translated diagonally one cell,
					for a total speed of c/6.
					Every 3 generations, the same pattern appears,
					flipped diagonally. 

					 The same evolutionary sequence works both in rule
					 B3/S23 
					and in rule
					 B3/S237 .
