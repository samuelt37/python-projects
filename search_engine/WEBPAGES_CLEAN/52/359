We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.
