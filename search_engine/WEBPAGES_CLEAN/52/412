         Simulation movie of the activator model simulated an a topology extracted from an experimental template. The simulation shows the WUSCHEL concentrations. The simulation starts with zero WUS concentrations everywhere and show the emerging WUS domain. Corresponds to Figure 7 in the paper  Jösson et al, "Modeling the organization of the WUSCHEL expression domain in the shoot apical meristem.", Bioinformatics, 21(S1):i232-240 (2005).
