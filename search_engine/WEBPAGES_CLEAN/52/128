Higher Lower Bounds from the 3SUM Conjecture
  
Tsvi Kopelowitz
   Abstract:   The 3SUM Conjecture has proven to be a valuable tool for proving
conditional lower bounds on dynamic data structures and graph
problems. This line of work was initiated by Pătraşcu (STOC 2010) who
reduced 3SUM to an offline SetDisjointness problem. However, the
reduction introduced by Pătraşcu suffers from several inefficiencies,
making it difficult to obtain tight conditional lower bounds from the
3SUM conjecture.  In this talk I'll discuss the deficiencies of Pătraşcu's framework,
then give new and efficient reductions from 3SUM to offline
SetDisjointness and offline SetIntersection (the reporting version of
SetDisjointness) which leads to polynomially higher lower bounds on
several problems.  ( Joint work  with Seth
Pettie and Ely Porat
 from SODA
2016 .)
