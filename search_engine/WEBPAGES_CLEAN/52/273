		 Printing in the labs » 

			 
			  

			 

         There is one printer available in CS 364 for student use. ICS Labs
          use a pay-per-sheet printing system that is provided by OIT. Each page
          costs 10 cents to print and you must have a valid print card.
         

           Where to get a print card  
            How to send and print documents  
            Getting Refunds  
             How to send and print documents 
         Windows: 
          Click on  print  from the application. 
           Make sure that the printer name is PayPrint CS364. 
           Go to the printer and follow the direction on the print station 
           On the screen, find your print job and then hit  Print . 
           You can continue to print other jobs or click  Logout  when
            you are done.  
           The station will display how much value is left on the card.
             PDF Files - if you are having problems printing a PDF file, please
              make sure that the postscript level is set to 1. To change the level,
              do the following: 
              Click on  print --&gt; Properties... --&gt; Advanced...  
               Under  Document Options , find  PostScript Options  
               Change  PostScript Language Level  to 1 
              If you find the print job is coming out slowly, try printing a
              couple of pages at a time. Some PDF files are quite large and the
              printer cannot process it all at once. 
           
          UNIX: 
          ASCII (text) files:  mp 
             asciifile.tx t  | lpr
            -Pppcs364  
           PostScript files:  lpr -Ppcs364 
             postscript.ps  
           TEX DVI files:  dvisp -Pppcs364 
             file.dvi  
          
           For more information, please refer to the  ICS
            Support UNIX Printing Guide . 
         
           Getting Refunds 
         If your print job does not print out properly (ie. streaks, paper jam)
          you can get a refund by contacting the Lab Manager in CS346L. If the
          Lab Manager is not available, please contact  OIT .
         
         If the print card dispenser malfunctioned and you did not get a card
          or it did not add value to your card, please contact  OIT .
