 CS 261, Winter 2011: Data Structures 

 This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
2:00 - 2:50 in Bren 1200. Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,
one midterm and a comprehensive final exam. Grading will be based 20% on
homework, 35% for the midterm, and 45% for the final. 

 The reader assigned to the course is Leila Jalali
. 

 There is no required textbook; however, you may find the following helpful for some of the material: 
  Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. I don't recommend that you buy the book for this course (it is expensive and only covers part of the material) but many of you are likely to have it from undergraduate CS courses and it includes useful material on several topics from this course. Other algorithms texts are also likely to be helpful; the one I use in my undergraduate algorithms courses is "Algorithm Design" by Goodrich and Tamassia.
