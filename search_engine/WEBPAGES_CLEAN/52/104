      subtype  subtype_name  is  base_type  range  range_constraint;
  
    
  



 
See LRM section 4.2

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    Assignments may not be made between objects of different types even
though they may be similar.
 type BUS_VAL is range 0 to 255;
type MY_LOGIC is ('0','1');

variable X_INT : integer := 22;
variable X_BUS : BUS_VAL := 22;
variable X_BIT : bit := '0';
variable X_MY  : MY_LOGIC := '0';
...
X_BUS := X_INT; --illegal
X_MY  := X_BIT; --illegal  
    
  

 
    Since a subtype is the  same type  as its base type,
assignments between subtype and base type onjects can be made without
conversion:
 subtype BUS_VAL is integer
                range 0 to 255;
subtype MY_LOGIC is std_ulogic
                range 'X' to 'Z';
variable X_INT : integer    := 22;
variable X_BUS : BUS_VAL;
variable X_STD : std_ulogic := '0';
variable X_MY  : MY_LOGIC;
...
X_BUS := X_INT; --legal
X_MY  := X_STD; --legal
  
    
  

 
    Subtypes  natural  and  positive  are predefined subtypes
of  integer 
 subtype NATURAL is integer range 0 to integer'high;
subtype POSITIVE is integer range 1 to integer'high;
  
    
  

 
    The std_logic_1164 package defines the following subtypes of
 std_logic :
 subtype XO1  is std_ulogic range 'X' to '1';
subtype XO1Z is std_ulogic range 'X' to 'Z';
subtype UXO1 is std_ulogic range 'U' to '1';
  
    
  

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    Most logic synthesis tools support subtypes of types that they
recognise.
 
Synthesis tools will infer an appropriate number of bits for enumerated
and integer subtypes, depending on the range.
  
    
  



 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, a new predefined subtype  delay_length  is defined,
which can only take on positive values.
  subtype delay_length is time range 0 fs to time'high;
