 ICS 160E / EECS 114 - Programming Project 4, 50 Points
 
Due: Friday, June 10, 2005, at 7pm,
using the
 
Checkmate Submission System .
 

 

 
In this project you are to write a Java program that 
builds the routing tables for all the
computers in a network, based on shortest-path routing.
The input for this problem is the connectivity information for the
network, given as follows:
  
 IP_Address :  IP_Address1   IP_Address2  ...   IP_AddressN 
 
which indicates that
the computer at address  IP_Address 
can get to the addresses 
 IP_Address1   IP_Address2  ...   IP_AddressN  in one
hop, as in the following example:
 
241.12.31.14: 241.12.31.15 241.12.31.18 241.12.31.19
 
The routing table for the computer
at  IP_Address  is a set of pairs 
( IP_AddressA, IP_AddressB ), 
which indicates that to route from  IP_Address  to go to 
 IP_AddressA  the next computer to send to (on the shortest path
to  IP_AddressA ) is  IP_AddressB .
Your program should output the routing table for each computer, as
shown as follows (for the computer at address 241.12.31.14):
 
241.12.31.14: 
	(241.12.31.15,241.12.31.15)
	(241.12.31.16,241.12.31.19)
	(241.12.31.17,241.12.31.18)
	(241.12.31.18,241.12.31.18)
	(241.12.31.19,241.12.31.19)
 

 
Note: you may use the following class in your program:
     
java.util.Scanner 
  
You should read network topology connectivity information
from System.in and output the routing table for each address
to System.out.
