        About the Laboratory</strong> 
           

      This lab is devoted to the study of testing problems in hardware
      and hardware/software systems. For large hardware and software
      design projects, it is typical that over 50% of design effort
      and cost is dedicated to testing and debugging. Our research
      includes testing for design errors and testing for physical
      defects occuring during the VLSI manufacturing process. The
      laboratory is directed by   Prof. Ian G. Harris 
      and research projects include Covalidation of Embedded
      Hardware-Software Systems, FPGA testing, Behavioral Design
      Validation, and Partial Scan/BIST Insertion.
