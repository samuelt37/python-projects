  Euler's Formula,
Proof 4: Induction on Edges
 

By combining the two previous proofs we get an induction
with a much simpler base case.

 
If the connected planar graph G has no edges, it is an isolated vertex
and V+F-E=1+1-0=2.  Otherwise, choose any edge  e .  If  e 
connects two vertices,
contract it, reducing V and E by one.  Otherwise, it is a Jordan curve
and separates two faces; remove it and reduce F and E by one.
In either case the result follows by induction.
 

This is the proof used by  van Lint and Wilson .
Other variants are possible -- if  e  connects two vertices and
separates two faces,
we may choose in various ways whether to delete or contract  e .
