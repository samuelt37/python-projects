Playing Mastermind with Many Colors
 
 
Alexander Nicholas Brown
 

 
We analyze the general version of the classic guessing game
Mastermind with n positions and k colors. Since the case
 k  ≤  n  1 − ε ,
ε &gt; 0 constant, is well
understood, we concentrate
on larger numbers of colors. For the most prominent case
 k  =  n , our results imply that Codebreaker can find the
secret code with O( n  log log  n )
guesses. This bound is valid
also when only black answer-pegs are used. It improves the
O( n  log  n ) bound first proven by Chvátal
(Combinatorica 3 (1983), 325–329). We also show that if both black and
white answer-pegs are used, then the
O( n  log log  n ) bound
holds for up to  n  2  log log  n 
colors. These bounds are almost
tight as the known lower bound of Ω( n ) shows. Unlike for
 k  ≤  n  1 − ε ,
simply guessing at random until the
secret code is determined is not sufficient. In fact, we show that any
non-adaptive strategy needs an expected number of
Ω( n  log  n ) guesses.
