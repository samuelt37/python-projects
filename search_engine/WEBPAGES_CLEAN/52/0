    CS 175: Assignment 2, Winter 2007    

  Instructions   
      Reading : Read the  
  
 scikit-learn tutorial on working with text data . You will probably also find it useful
 to read through the  
 scikit-learn tutorial on supervised learning.      Make a local copy of 
 assignment2.py , 
read the contents, and submit your modified file (same name, assignment1.py) to the EEE assignment 1 dropbox      The assignment has 7 parts. 
   The first 6 parts involve writing functions, where the skeleton of the
function is provided and you fill in the details.  
  The last part is some script code that calls the functions to classify sample
documents, to compute classification accuracies, and so on. This part contains multiple places
where you are asked to fill in code  
  Note: you may want to work on and test some of these functions separately from the main
file and then paste in your solutions at the end (into assignment2.py)  before you submit.  
       Deadline : Noon on Thursday 26th
