   ``What is a URL?'' 
according to the
 World Wide Web FAQ 

    URN = Uniform
Resource Name 

    Sample URLs 
A reference to a server's root directory is very simple:   
http://www.oac.uci.edu/   
Here is a citation of a document provided by that server:   
http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/ht/disclaimer.html   
One can also refer to a Unix home directory:   
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/   
The primary links to documents, searchable indices, interactive 
images, and forms all have the same syntax.
 
 Other protocols 
are handled by web browsers:   
gopher://gopher.cwis.uci.edu/     
ftp://ftp.uci.edu/     mailto:vitus@ics.uci.edu     
telnet://library@antpac.lib.uci.edu   
Note that a telnet reference can include both the system
and the login name on the system.
Not all WWW clients (browsers) know how to use the login name.
  
There is syntax for a location within an large document:   
http://www.ics.uci.edu/WWWdocs/localFAQ.html#Acronyms   
or a position within an interactive image:   
http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com/map?121,95   
or a keyword in a searchable index:   
http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phwww?wilkening    
  
Relative references give a URL in terms
of where the reference is in relation to the document currently being
viewed.
For example,  just "/"  indicates the root
directory of the server on which this document is located,   #other   indicates the anchor
`` other '' in this document, and   sample.html   indicates
the document `` sample.html '' located in the same
directory as this document.
