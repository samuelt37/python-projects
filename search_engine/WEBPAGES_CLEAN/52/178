    An Overview of Zero Knowledge Identification Protocols
 
  Rishab Nithyanand, UC Irvine 


 

In this presentation I will cover:
Interactive Proof Protocols (concept, model of computation, and an example),

  
Identification Protocols (Objectives, Security Requirements, Applications,
and its Comparison with Digital Signature Schemes),

  
Zero Knowledge Concepts (Soundness, Completeness, Indistinguishability,
Perfect ZK vs. Computational ZK, and ZK Identification vs. Other
Identification Protocols).

  
Finally, I will present the working of the Fiat-Shamir ZK Identification
protocol and Schnorrs ZK Identification protocol with examples.
