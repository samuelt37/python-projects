 AND/OR Graph Search for Genetic Linkage Analysis 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
AND/OR search spaces have recently been introduced as a
unifying framework for advanced algorithmic schemes for
graphical models. The main virtue of this representation
is its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can
translate into exponential time savings for search algorithms.
AND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) is a new algorithm that
explores the AND/OR search tree for solving optimization
tasks in graphical models. In this paper we extend the algorithm
to explore an AND/OR search graph by equipping
it with a context-based adaptive caching scheme similar to
good and no-good recording. The efficiency of the new graph
search algorithm is demonstrated empirically on the very
challenging benchmarks that arise in genetic linkage analysis.
