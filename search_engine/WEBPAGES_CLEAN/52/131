                Hi!
                
                I was a Ph.D. candidate in the  computer vision group 
                
                at  UC Irvine , where I was advised by
                 Charless Fowlkes .
                
                
                I graduated in September and will work at Amazon in Seattle.
                I received a B.Sc. in computer science from UC Irvine in 2009.
