 User preferences 
     After creating an account you are directed to the page   UserPreferences </strong>, where you can change your preferences and settings.       The default values should be fine for most of the preferences, but you might want to change:      the time zone (to convert the UTC time to your current time).     the size of the input box (depends on your screen resolution and font preferences).     maybe the preferred language (not necessary with a correctly configured browser).        Then click on the  save</strong> button at the bottom of the page.
