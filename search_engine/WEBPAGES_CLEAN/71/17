 """Wrap.py

Break paragraphs into lines, attempting to avoid short lines.

We use the dynamic programming idea of Knuth-Plass to find the
optimal set of breaks according to a penalty function that
penalizes short lines quadratically; this can be done in linear
time via the OnlineConcaveMinima algorithm in SMAWK.py.
