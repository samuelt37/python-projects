    Dynamic Program Analyzer for Java Bytecode 


 
   
    December 2011 to March 2012
   
  
   Developed a framework for dynamic program analysis for Java byte code using  ASM . The framework instruments the bytecode for a given Java system/project and performs analysis to detect the data and control dependencies between statements of source code. 

 

  TL;DR  - Runtime program analysis framework via Java byte code instrumentation using ASM (asm.ow2.org).
