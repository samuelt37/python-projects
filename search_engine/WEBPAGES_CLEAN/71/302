28.2.2 The OpenEye Hydrogen Count Model 
 

 
OpenEye's hydrogen count valence model is used by OEChem when neither hydrogen
counts nor valence are specified.  The typical uses are reading molecules from
PDB or XYZ format files without explicit hydrogens.  This functionality is
invoked by  OEAssignImplicitHydrogens , which must always be followed by
a call to  OEAssignFormalCharges .  This valence model is unique in that
it only partially updates hydrogen counts, assuming the unfilled valences
will be corrected by OpenEye's charge valence model above.  In MDL's model
for example, a neutral sodium atom is assumed to have one implicit hydrogen,
 i.e.  sodium hydride instead of sodium metal.  In OpenEye's hydrogen
count valence model, a disconnected sodium atom is assumed to be a sodium
cation,  [Na+] .  When reading from PDB files, this is a very reasonable
assumption.

  
Note that although the OpenEye hydrogen count valence model often sets charge
and protonation states to physiological conditions, it is neither intended to
be a pKa nor ionization state predictor.  Instead, it is a normalization.  Much
like many registry system (and the MDL valence model) will convert
 C(=O)[O-]  to  C(=O)O  for registration purposes, this valence
model converts the opposite direction to  C(=O)[O-] .

  

   Carbon is always assumed to be at least four valent, and therefore
neutral.

 
  
 Nitrogens that are conjugated (have double bonds, or have neighbors that
have double bonds, in their Kekul√© representations) are assumed at least
three valent and neutral, whilst all other nitrogens are assumed to be
(minimum) four valent, with a +1 formal charge.

 
  
 Oxygens are assumed to be at least two valent and neutral, unless they
have a single bond to an atom that is doubly bonded to oxygen, in which case
its assumed to be one valent, with a -1 formal charge.

 
  
 Sulfur is assumed to always be at least two valent.

 
  
  
All other elements are assumed to have no implicit hydrogens, and the formal
charge as specified by the OpenEye charge model.  This models all disconnected
halogens as halide anions, and when disconnected the metals listed above as
cations.

  
These rules are sufficient to reasonably protonate proteins read from PDB
files.  However, as described above, these rules are not intended to be a
comprehensive rule-based pKa predictor.  Users interested in predicting
physiological ionization, and protonation/disassociation state enumeration
should contact OpenEye Scientific Software about our tools for exactly this
task.
