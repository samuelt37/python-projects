		Welcome to geo-social alerting webpage.

		   Overview 
          This project focuses on exploratory research towards the next generation of adaptive socio-technical crisis alerting and warning systems. Alerting systems inform social entities affected by crisis - schools, businesses, hospitals, and the public at large - about impending dangers, the status of infrastructures, life lines and available help and actions designed to reduce exposure to natural and human-induced threats - e.g. evacuate, shelter-in-place etc. The eventual goal is to develop alerting systems that deliver an accurate message to the right targets in the right format and the right time, however this requires a synergistic exploration of the challenges at multiple levels - physical/geographical, network and user levels. This effort is an initial exploratory effort that aims to meaningfully combine the three levels into effective alerting schemes.

		      Geography-based information dissemination system</strong>  
		  The project aims to develop generalized models of geography-based information dissemination systems that incorporates both geographical aspects of alerts and societal/user information. This requires a synergistic exploration of the challenges at multiple levels : physical/geographical, communication network and user/societal levels and aims to meaningfully combine the three levels into effective alerting schemes. Research will be conducted on developing mechanisms to create and maintain geo-aware network overlays and enhance them to capture societal characteristics via a geo-social mapping process that exploits key societal characteristics (e.g. reachability, technology connectivity). Novel geo-alerting protocols will be developed that will enable fast and reliable dissemination of information in geo-social overlays despite correlated geographic failure. This project is an exploratory effort towards the next generation of socio-technical crisis alerting systems that aim to disseminate meaningful alert messages to targeted audiences in the right format and at the right time in the event of disasters. The effort will thus serve as a stimulus that will enable us to undertake future larger challenges in this important interdisciplinary area. 
		 As a preliminary work, we have explored the impact of geographical failures to the information dissemination over multi-layered (physical/logical) overlay networks. Based on the initial observation of the relabtionship between regional failures and mapping between multiple layers, we have developed a proximity aware reliable overlay construction method in order to sustain high global reachability of information dissemination system even under severe disaster, which may cause simultaneous regional failures of large-scale infrastructures. The proposed overlay construction method can also be used for designing combined networks.

		      Societal &amp; geographical notification</strong> 
		  The eventual gole of information dissemination in emergency situation is to reach as many relevant recipients as possible in a timely manner. In order to reach more recipients in extreme situations with geocorrelated failures, we exploit the possibility of delayed diffusion of message through social networks. In a social network, social entities communicate with each other using multiple channels (telephone, social media, face-to-face conversations) which have distinct properties (propagation delay, transmission delay, queuing delay). Additionally, people-centric of behavior-centric correlations between social entities which may control the direction of social diffusion. This project focus to incorporate these characteristics of social networks to capture social diffusion by using various diffusion models (e.g. a delay weighted independent cascade social diffusion model). Also this project develop techniques that leverage the most influential social entities to disseminate a geocorrelated message to a given set of relevant recipients. We expect that such a social diffusion process that is biased towards the more influential entities enhances the performance of information dissemination techniques in terms of latency as well as reliability.

		      Efficient publish/subscribe 
		notification systems</strong> 

		  Emerging societal scale notiﬁcation applications call for a system 
		that is able to efficiently support simple, yet changing subscriptions 
		for a very large number of users. We conjecture that a topic-based 
		pub/sub system can form the basis of an efficient architecture to deal 
		with the simple, yet changing notiﬁcation needs of a large number of 
		users; for example by routing events through group multicast to peers 
		that match subscription topics. Subscription insertion/removal and event 
		routing on a broker can be easily done in O(1) time. We develop topic 
		based pub/sub system that provides efficient scalable event notiﬁcations 
		for dynamic subscriptions.

            Efficient information dissemination over hybrid networks </strong>  

		  Wireless networks (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi) extend wireline networks in warning and notifying large number of people (both the public and first responders) in crisis situations. People with handheld devices (e.g., cell phones, PDAs) not only receive emergency alerts, but also share warnings and other related information between each other via ad hoc networks. In this work, we study fast, reliable, and efficient dissemination of application-generated data in heterogeneous wireless networks. We consider coverage (the percentage of intended recipients that receive the information), redundancy (the time it takes for people to receive the information) and energy consumption (on handheld devices) as the primary metrics. We develop efficient dissemination strategies that are not only fast and reliable, but also resilient to network congestion and recipients' mobility. We propose protocols that manage the dissemination of data with large size. We also investigate exploiting multiple radio interfaces, hybrid networks as well as mobility for faster dissemination
