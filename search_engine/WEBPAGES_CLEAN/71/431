    Planar orientations with low out-degree and compaction of adjacency matrices .  
M. Chrobak  and D. Eppstein.   Theor. Comp. Sci.  86 (2): 243–266, 1991 .
 
Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,
with few pairs of subsets connected by edges.
(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a
factorization does not always exist.

The complement of a
 minimum spanning tree  is a maximum spanning tree in
the dual graph.  By applying this fact we can use a modified form of
Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to update the MST in
logarithmic time per update.

(special issue for 2nd Scand. Worksh. Algorithm Theory).
 
By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O( k )
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving  m  or  n 
to one involving min( m,   k ) or min( n,   k )
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the  k  smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order ( k +1) Voronoi diagrams.

    Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity . 
D. Eppstein. 
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.   J. Graph Th.  17: 409–416, 1993 .
 
It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 94-11 , ICS, UCI, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
  
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
 formal
concept analysis . If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

    Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188. 
 
For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

    Finding the  k  shortest paths .

 SIAM J. Computing  28 (2): 652–673, 1998 .
 
This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the  k  shortest in the graph, where  k  is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
  
The  k  shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
 k  shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.

We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented

experimental results.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates

We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching
parts of the meshes are small.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

Invited talk at INFORMS 2009, San Diego.
 
We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.
  
    Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many
crossings .

New York, 2009, pp. 150–159 .   SIAM J. Computing  39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010 .
 
If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line

We survey problems in computational geometry that may be solved by
constructing an auxiliary graph from the problem and solving a
graph-theoretic problem on the auxiliary graph. The problems considered
include the art gallery problem, partitioning into rectangles, minimum
diameter clustering, bend minimization in cartogram construction, mesh
stripification, optimal angular resolution, and metric embedding.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper  Algorithms for Drawing Media . Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

pp. 1076–1086.
 
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n ε -approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n 1 − ε  for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L 1  plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

Comp. Sci.  6506, 2010, pp. 403–414 .  
We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3 d/3 ) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist  Mark Lombardi , we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the  Lombardi
Spirograph , is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of
subgraph there are in a larger undirected graph, when the subgraphs have
at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.
  
    Densities of minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1009.5633 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  17(1), Paper R136, 2010 .
 
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
 c ( n  +  o ( n ); for instance, for
planar graphs,  c  = 3. We call  c  the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ω ω , and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)  
We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid

no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms

the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs .

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.
  
    On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs .  F. J. Brandenburg ,

J. Reislhuber.  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 327–338 .  
A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.

We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a

data structures for querying the parameters of these graphs.

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial

We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge

represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of
a human learning. In this chapter we show how to use the same data
structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger
learning space (an important subroutine in knowledge assessment) and to
modify a learning space to more accurately model students.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103  .
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that  m /5.22 vertices are sufficient
and  m /(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

Applications  19 (2): 619–656, 2015 .
 
We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.
  
    Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs

Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 210–221. 
 
We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.

Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 272–283. 
 
Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

    ERGMs are hard .  M. J. Bannister ,

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1502.05334 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  20 (2): 323–346, 2016 .
 
We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the

The Graph Drawing version used the alternative title
"Genus, treewidth, and local crossing number".
We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the

embedded on low-genus surfaces.

 V. Dujmović ,

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.
The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout,
and uses the title "Track Layout is Hard".

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

We study the problem of splitting the vertices of a given graph into a
bounded number of sub-vertices (with each edge attaching to one of the
sub-vertices) in order to make the resulting graph planar.
It is NP-complete, but can be approximated to within a constant factor,
and is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth.

The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
 d -dimensional tensor, describing the number of  d -tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any  d  ≥ 3, or for  d  = 2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).

We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.
