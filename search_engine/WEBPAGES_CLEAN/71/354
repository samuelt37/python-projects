 Still Lifes and Oscillators 

Many of Life's simpler still lifes and oscillators continue to work
in B35/S236, but there are some surprises. 

     

 Particularly useful seem to be the small period 24 and period 68
oscillators, which shoot off large sparks that could be useful in
various reactions.
