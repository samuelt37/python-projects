              Abstract   
	    We describe a distributed version of an advanced branch
	    and bound algorithm over graphical models. The crucial
	    issue of load balancing is addressed by estimating
	    subproblem complexity through learning, yielding
	    impressive speedups on various hard problems using
	    hundreds of parallel CPUs.
