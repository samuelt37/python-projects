    May 2013 to June 2013
   
  
   Live demo:  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vpalepu/205project  

 The purpose of this interactive narrative-based tutorial on statistical methods is to establish a simplified way for students to learn statistical concepts (specifically Hypothesis testing with t-tests) that are grounded in real-life examples. In addition to a narrative, an interface in presented that allows students to interact with data sets that are accessible on-line. 

 The goal is to give students interested in doing research a fun way to quickly and clearly understand critical concepts in statistics, needed to continue to experiment with their own data sets (or on-line ones) so they can interpret future data sets they work with in meaningful and statistically sound ways. 

  IMPORTANT:</strong> This project was done as a part of a class project in collaboration with Sonny Lin and Dahlia Hegab, at UC Irvine, CA. 

 

  TL;DR  - Interactive, narrative-based, tutorial for students to learn statistical concepts (specifically Hypothesis testing with t-Tests).
