   Attribute Information:  
  1 Page Popularity/likes Decimal Encoding Page feature Defines the popularity or support for the source of the document.   2 Page Checkinsâ€™s Decimal Encoding Page  feature Describes how many individuals so far visited this place. This feature is only associated with the places eg:some institution, place, theater etc.   3 Page talking about Decimal Encoding Page feature Defines the daily interest of individuals towards source of the document/ Post. The people who actually come back to the page, after liking the page. This include activities such as comments, likes to a post, shares, etc by visitors to the page.   4 Page Category Value  Encoding Page feature Defines the category of the source of the document eg: place, institution, brand etc.   5 - 29 Derived Decimal  Encoding Derived feature These features are aggregated by page, by calculating min, max, average, median and standard deviation of essential features.   30 CC1 Decimal Encoding Essential feature The total number of comments before selected base date/time.   31 CC2 Decimal Encoding Essential feature The number of comments in last 24 hours, relative to base date/time.   32 CC3 Decimal Encoding Essential feature The number of comments in last 48 to last 24 hours relative to base date/time.   33 CC4 Decimal Encoding Essential feature The number of comments in the first 24 hours after the publication of post but before base date/time.   34 CC5 Decimal Encoding Essential feature The difference between CC2 and CC3.   35 Base time Decimal(0-71) Encoding Other feature Selected time in order to simulate the scenario.   36 Post length Decimal Encoding Other feature Character count in the post.   37 Post Share Count ï¿¼ï¿¼Decimal Encoding Other feature This features counts the no of shares of the post, that how many peoples had shared this post on to their timeline.   38 Post Promotion Status ï¿¼ï¿¼Binary Encoding Other feature To reach more people with posts in News Feed, individual promote their post and this features tells that whether the post is promoted(1) or not(0).   39 H Local ï¿¼Decimal(0-23) Encoding Other feature This describes the H hrs, for which we have the target variable/ comments received.   40-46 Post published weekday Binary Encoding Weekdays feature This represents the day(Sunday...Saturday) on which the post was published.   47-53 Base DateTime weekday Binary Encoding Weekdays feature This represents the day(Sunday...Saturday) on selected base Date/Time.  54 Target Variable Decimal Target The no of comments in next H hrs(H is given in Feature no 39).
