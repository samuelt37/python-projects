               turkeypop  

       Data from an experiment done to examine the "anchoring"
      effect, which is that a person's estimate of a quantity is influenced
      by numbers given in prior questions. At a conference for teachers
      of business statistics, n = 45 participants were randomized to
      two experimental groups. One group answered the question "Do
      you think the population of Turkey is more than 10 million?" 
      The other group answered the question " Do you think the
      population of Turkey is more than 70 million?" All participants
      were then asked to estimate the population of Turkey, to the
      nearest million. If the anchoring effect holds, participants
      asked if the population is more than 70 million would tend to
      give higher estimates than those who were asked if it is more
      than 10 million.  (Source:  The authors)
