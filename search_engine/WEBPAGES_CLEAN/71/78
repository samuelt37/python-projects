//
// This class should contain the majority of the code for your user interface.
// To help you get started, I've included a little bit of code:
//
//   * In the constructor, I've created three objects that you'll need in
//     various places: a Scanner to read input, a PayrollMenu (see
//     PayrollMenu.java for more information about that), and an
//     ArrayList that you should use to store all of the employees.
//
// You should start by adding code to the go() method that displays the menu,
// asks the user for the next command, and processes that command.  (Be aware
// that the PayrollMenu object can do some of this work for you.  See the
// PayrollMenu.java file for more information before you proceed.)

//This is the class that is where the majority of the coding happens. 
//This class implements and runs everything for all three types of employees and then
//outputs their pay check and all the other tasks that are requried by this program
