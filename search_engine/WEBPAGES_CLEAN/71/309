 This paper contains a proof that the
 splitting method  terminates; Wagon

 Defines two methods for Egyptian fraction representation: what he
calls the Farey sequence method, which is equivalent to the
 continued fraction method  described here, and what he calls the continued fraction method, which is a variant of what
we call the
 grouped continued fraction method .

 Shows that every x/y with y odd has an
Egyptian fraction representation with all denominators odd, by using a method similar to the
 binary remainder method  but using the base 5(3^k) instead of 2^k.

a graph, used in our implementation of the
 grouped continued fraction method .

 I describe what is theoretically the fastest known algorithm for the shortest path problem used in the
 grouped continued fraction method , however my technique is rather more complex than that of
 [BW84]  and has not been implemented in
 Mathematica.

 Guy lists a number of questions about Egyptian fractions, including the following:
   Does 4/y have a 3-term representation for all y?
 Does 5/y?  Does x/y for x sufficiently large relative to y?
   Does the odd greedy method terminate?
   What different denominators are possible in a t-term representation of one?
Do all positive-density sets of integers have a subset forming the denominators of a representation of one?
  If we assign to each of the integers one of a finite set  of colors, can we pick a single color that can be used as the denominators for representations of all rationals?
  Guy also provides a long bibliography.

 Concentrates  primarily on the question of
 whether the odd greedy method halts ; notes that a similar method for finding representations with even denominators does halt; contains a number of further references.

 Discusses the question of
 whether 4/y has a three-term representation ; describes methods of finding such representations depending on the value of n modulo various small primes.

 Uses the
 binary remainder method  to find representations with all denominators even.  Also, like
 [Bre54] , uses a method similar to the binary remainder method (using base 35(3^k))
to find odd representations of fractions with odd denominators.

 Stewart shows that any rational has only a finite number of t-term Egyptian fraction representations, for any fixed number t, and describes a
 brute force method  for finding all such representations.

On an indeterminate equation.

 In this paper, discovered for me by Stefan Bartels, Takenouchi proves that any number with a k-term unit fraction representation has a representation in which all terms are distinct. Bartels writes "Takenouchi does not state the theorem itself but gives a proof to it. He uses the fact that the sum of the denominators of the representation increases and the fact that the number of representations of a given length is finite.  As far as I know this article has not been recognized in the meantime. I found some proofs (done in the 60s) which for example prove that n/m can be
represented as a sum of n Egyptian fractions. This shows that the article is (was) quite unknown in mathematical literature."

 This paper provides good simultanous bounds on the number of terms and the denominators of an Egyptian fraction representation, as discussed in the section on the
 binary remainder method .

 Shows that every x/y has a t-term representation where t=O(Sqrt Log[y]).  The technique is similar to the
 binary remainder method .

 Wagon implements the
 greedy and odd greedy methods,
 and describes the
 splitting method.
 He also mentions the open problem of
 whether the odd greedy method always terminates
 for the special case of fractions with numerator 2.
