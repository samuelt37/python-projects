                                                         Vibrant lighting of relief maps via high-resolution dynamic projected imagery can be a powerful tool for simulation, augmented reality, and visualization, enabling several scientific, educational and entertainment applications. This is usually achieved via multiple projectors lighting the relief map, which are then sensed by multiple cameras for geometric and color calibration. However, cumbersome semi-automatic calibration techniques have limited the applicability of such systems. 
                                                         In this paper we present the first fully-automatic lighting system that registers high-resolution images on arbitrarily-shaped relief maps using a network of projectors and cameras. The devices are uncalibrated and casually aligned with the only constraint that every surface point of the relief is seen by at least two of the cameras. Our method achieves precise geometric registration followed by seamless edge blending. Quick recalibration allows changes in the position and number of the devices, as well as the surface geometry. Thus, our work can enable easy deployment of spatially augmented reality environments in various scales playing a fundamental role in increasing their popularity in several applications like geospatial analysis, architectural lighting, cultural heritage restoration, theatrical lighting and visualization. It can also be applied to any immersive VR environments on non-planar surfaces like domes or cylinders.

                                                         Clustering is the problem of finding relations in a data set in an supervised manner. These relations can be extracted using the density of a data set, where density of a data point is defined as the number of data points around it. To find the number of data points around another point, region queries are adopted. Region queries are the most expensive construct in density based algorithm, so it should be optimized to enhance the performance of density based clustering algorithms specially on large data sets. Finding the optimum set of region queries to cover all the data points has been proven to be NP-complete. This optimum set is called the skeletal points of a data set.
In this paper, we proposed a generic algorithms which fires region queries at most 6 times the optimum number of region queries (has 6 as approximation factor). Also, we have extend this generic algorithm to create a DBSCAN (the most well- known density based algorithm) derivative, named ADBSCAN. Presented experimental results show that ADBSCAN has a better approximation to DBCSAN than the DBRS (the most well-known randomized density based algorithm) in terms of performance and quality of clustering, specially for large data sets.
