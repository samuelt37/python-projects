			 Testing Large-Scale Galaxy Simulations   » 

			
             
			    Researchers in the physical sciences such as astronomy and physics rely on computational power to create and test large-scale simulations. Professor Wayne Hayes collaborates across disciplines to test the reliability of large-scale physical simulations such as galaxy and cosmological n-body simulations as performed by astronomers.
