    Students interested in supplementing another Bren School degree or any UCI bachelor’s degree, whether it be in the arts or biological sciences or any other discipline, will find these minors complement their undergraduate education.
          
      
         
      Bioinformatics:  The minor provides a focused study of bioinformatics to supplement a student’s major program of study and prepares students for a profession, career, or academic pursuit in which biomedical computing is an integral part but not the primary focus.  
         Digital Information Systems: The minor is designed for students who want to learn about information systems, computation, and digital communication without preparing to be computer programmers.  
         Health Informatics: The minor in Health Informatics prepares students to understand the expanding role of information technology (IT) in health care and to participate in creating IT solutions to health care issues.  
         Informatics: The minor particularly centers on understanding the relationships among computers and people, and how these relationships must be addressed in information and software design. 
         Information and Computer Science: The minor contributes to students' competence in computing technology and programming proficiency, and in addition, exposes them to the fundamentals of computer science.  
         Statistics: The minor is designed to provide students with exposure to both statistical theory and practice.
