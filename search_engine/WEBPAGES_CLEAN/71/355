 <body> ICT Phase II Reading List (v9, January 2005)  Note  The goal of the Phase II exam is to ensure that ICT studentsare familiar with the major schools of thought and the work of a range ofsignificant contributors in the field of social informatics/ICT. It does notconstitute "everything you need to know," but rather provides an overview ofthose perspectives that will allow students to critically engage with theresearch literature. It is representative rather than exhaustive. The Phase IIexam is not intended to test students' familiarity with the readings, butrather their ability to construct and develop arguments about the field ofsocial informatics/ICT; the readings are an introduction to the relevantfoundations for such arguments. Through familiarity with these scholars andtheir writings, we expect you to be able to formulate coherent critiques andanalyses of topics in Informatics.     Readings  Ackerman, M. (2000).
