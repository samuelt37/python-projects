  November 6, 1998: 
Generation of Well-Formed Parenthesis Strings in Constant
Worst-Case Time 
Junyu Peng, ICS, UC Irvine 

 Proskurowski and Ruskey ( J. Algorithms 11(1990) )
published a recursive algorithm for generating well-formed
parenthesis strings of length 2 n  and challenged the reader
to find a loop-free version of their algorithm. We present two
nonrecursive versions of their algorithm, one of which generates
each string in O( n ) worst-case time and requires space for
only O(1) extra integer variables, and the other generates each
string in O(1) worst-case time and uses O( n ) extra
space.
