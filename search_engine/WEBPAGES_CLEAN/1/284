	    In February 2012 I completed a PhD in computer science at the
	    University of California, Irvine. 
	    My advisor was  Eric
	      Mjolsness .
            The main webpage for Eric's research group is 
             Computable
            Plant .

	  My research interests are in machine learning, artificial
	  intelligence, and computational biology. 
            
          My PhD thesis focused on two novel approaches in probabilistic
          graphical
	  models. Each of these is described on its
	  own page. Each page also includes links to download software
	  packages for the Mathematica programming langauge, and
	  example notebooks. 
             Dependency
	  Diagrams  extend  
          factor graphs (a superset of Bayesian networks and Markov
          random fields). I used them to implement a package that,
          among other things, automatically generates runnable source
          code for the process of performing Metropolis-Hastings
          sampling on arbitrary
	  distributions.    Graph-Constrained   
	    Correlation Dynamics  formalizes a method of
	  representing probability distributions that evolve
	  continuously in time. The software package leverages
	  Dependency Diagrams to optimize GCCD models. 
             
          My thesis is also available as a 
           PDF . 
         
       
       
        selected side projects    I wrote this implementation of parallel 
             Lam-Delosme
	      simulated annealing  for statistical numerical
	        optimization in 
	    Mathematica.  
           I implemented 
	    a  Bayesian
	    Logic  model 
	    that 
             predicts  
	      the outcomes of basketball games . This required
	    implementing an 
	    approximate Gibbs sampler for BLOG, making me (according to
	    Brian Milch) maybe the first person outside of his and
	    Russell's research groups to implement a custom proposer 
	    class for BLOG. If this is something you need to do, I would
	    be happy to talk about the process. 
            David
	    Orendorff ,  Drew 
	    Frank , and I placed third in the 
             2008 UCSD data mining
	      competition  using bagged combinations of neural networks,
	    SVMs, and naive bayes classifiers.

	  I read, when I can;
	  my  Goodreads
	  page is here .  
	  I can be found on
	   Facebook
	  here . 
	  I am lucky enough to be married
	  to  Ruth
	  Barrett , an excptionally talented neuroscientist. 
	  We have a  weblog ,
	  where we post pictures and occassional 
	  goings-on, for friends and family. 
	  I also maintain
	  a  weblog  with some
	  friends from college.	     
	  Coincidentally, all of the males in my immediate
	  family-in-law are also computer scientists. 
	  Sorted by the
	  degree to which our research is related, these fine fellows
	  are: 
	     Leon Barrett 
	      (PhD from UC Berkeley, now at Google)    
	      Sam
		Barrett  (PhD student at UT Austin)   
	      Marty
		Barrett  (a professor at East Tennessee State)
