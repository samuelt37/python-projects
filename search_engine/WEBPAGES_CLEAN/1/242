              Abstract   

  A strategy for parallelization of a state-of-the-art Branch and
  Bound algorithm for weighted CSPs and other graphical model
  optimization tasks is introduced: independent worker nodes
  concurrently solve subproblems, managed by a Branch and Bound master
  node; the problem cost functions are used to predict subproblem
  complexity, enabling efficient load balancing, which is crucial for
  the performance of the parallelization process. Experimental
  evaluation on up to 20 nodes yields very promising results and
  suggests the effectiveness of the scheme. The system runs on loosely
  coupled commodity hardware, simplifying deployment on a larger scale
  in the future.
