                                  WICS hosted a Board Game and Movie night to help anyone who wanted to take a break from studying on Monday, January 25th. Various board and card games were set out on three different tables so that people could feel free to play and socialize with other members. People who wanted to see a movie watched    Mean Girls    on the main screen. Over 20 people joined us in the fun. With midterms coming up, the event was a space where people could take a breather and relax with other students.
