 Homework: exercises 12.2-8, 12.4-3, 13.2-4, 13.3-6; problem 18-1.


Motivation: sequential searching in lists
    move-to-front heuristic

Static analysis:
	assume inputs drawn from some random distribution
		(distr. not known =&gt; assume worst case)
	compare your algorithm (which doesn't know distribut)
		to best algorithm knowing distribution
	for sequential searching, best algorithm
		is to sort in order by priority

Competetive analysis: [Irani]
	ratio your alg. to precognitive alg
		on worst-case input sequence
	since w.c. seq, not w.c. dist, results are stronger than static

For move-to-front:
	comparing MTF and OPT, where OPT may be assumed to know input seq
	as both algorithms progress, let
		Phi = #pairs x,y where xy in OPT
	initially zero, always positive

	def amortized cost(MTF) = actual cost + Delta Phi

	when search for item x, let
		k = #items before x in both MTF and OPT
		l = #items before x that are only in MTF
	then cost(OPT) &gt;= k
	     cost(MTF) = k+l (actual) + k (increase Phi) - l (decrease phi)

So MTF within factor of two of cost of any other sequential search heur!


Back to search trees...

Splay trees
	Sleater and Tarjan 1985

	binary search tree
	each node stores: left and right children

	UNLIKE other search structures so far,
	searches will change structure of tree
	all op times (including search) amortized

	search(x):
		usual binary search for x,
			storing list of nodes on path from root
		then: splay -- repeatedly rotate so x=&gt;root

		double rot: zigzag =&gt; balance, straight=&gt;straight
		+ single rot at root if path has odd length

	insert(x):
		usual bst insert + splay

	delete(x):
		if x has one child, splice out, splay parent
		else: replace with sliced-out successor, splay
			previous parent of successor

Amortized analysis:
	assign weight w(x) to item x
	total weight tw(x) = sum_{y in subtree rooted at x} w(y)
	rank(x) = floor(log_2(tw(x)))

	Phi = sum_x rank(x)

	Time per operation = O(# splay steps)

	So (with a little care for insert/delete)
	We mainly need to show that splay takes O(log n) amortized steps

	Lemma: on splay, #steps + Delta Phi  O(log n); otherwise get weighted search tree]

		proof: induction on # steps

		single rot: rank at root stays same
			rank(new child)
