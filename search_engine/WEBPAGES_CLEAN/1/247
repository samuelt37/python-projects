2.3 Creating a Molecule from SMILES 
 

 
A common method of creating a molecule in OEChem is via the SMILES
representation.  SMILES notation is commonly used in chemical
information systems, as it provides a convenient string representation
of a molecule.  An introduction to SMILES syntax is provided later in
this manual.  For examples, below we'll use the SMILES ``c1ccccc1'' which
describes the molecule benzene.

  
A molecule can be created from a SMILES string using the function
 OEParseSmiles() .

  
    #include "oechem.h"

using namespace OEChem;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;

  OEParseSmiles(mol,"c1ccccc1");
  return 0;
}

The OEParseSmiles function actually returns a boolean result indicating
whether the input string was a valid SMILES string.  It's good
programming practice to check the return value and report an error
message if anything went wrong.  The following example uses C++'s
iostream library to report the error.

  
    #include "oechem.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;

  if (OEParseSmiles(mol,"c1ccccc1"))
  {
    // Do something with the molecule!
  }
  else cerr &lt;&lt; "SMILES string was invalid!" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

The molecule returned by OEParseSmiles preserves the aromaticity present
in the input SMILES string, so for example, if benzene is expressed as
``c1ccccc1'' all atoms and bonds are marked as aromatic, but if expressed
as a Kekul√© form, ``C1=CC=CC=C1'' all atoms and bonds are kept aliphatic.
A common task after creating a molecule from SMILES is to normalize its
aromaticity with OEAssignAromaticFlags.

  
    #include "oechem.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;

  if (OEParseSmiles(mol,"c1ccccc1"))
  {
    OEAssignAromaticFlags(mol);
    // Do something with the molecule!
  }
  else cerr &lt;&lt; "SMILES string was invalid!" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
