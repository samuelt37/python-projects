		 The Center is very grateful for a recent gift from Yahoo! – the gift is specifically targeted at supporting the  weekly AI and machine learning seminar series . This series has proven very popular with graduate students and faculty, and we had an excellent set of talks in Fall quarter, including visitors such as Geoff Hinton, Milind Tambe, and Dave Blei. The  Distinguished Speaker Series  also got off to a great start in the Fall, with talks by Judea Pearl, David Heckerman, and Tommi Jaakkola.  Next quarter, we look forward to visits from Tom Griffiths, Andrew McCallum, and Trevor Hastie.
