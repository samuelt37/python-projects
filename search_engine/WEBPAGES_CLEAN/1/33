  Do not post your homework or
lab solutions anywhere on the Internet - including Dropbox, GitHub, Facebook,
etc. We will treat that as cheating (supplying solutions to other students is
cheating). Remember, cheating voids the learning process and that is why
schools and teachers are so against any form of cheating.  

  Put this template at the top
of each program file you write and fill in the lab number and problem number
and your ID, Name for each member of the pair indicating which person was the
Driver and which was the Navigator for this program:

  You will upload one copy of
your lab program your pair writes this week. Note you must demo each program to
your TA in your assigned lab to get credit for it. If you run out of time you
may upload only without TA demo for partial credit.  

     

   We want you to use this in
each of your programs you write this week.  Note when you run your script
file, the name will be main, so this will call your main function.   

   if __name__ == "__main__":   

       main()   

     

   Question 3 : File By Grade:    Write a program that reads a input files score.txt.
This program should create a list of student objects using the class provided
in the start given below (copy and paste the entire program start into your
file before you begin).  The program should start by asking the user for
the number of assignments expected for each student, this number is only used for
grade calculation.  The program will read each file (score.txt) and
collect the total number of points for hw and lab for each student. All
homework and lab scores are contained in score.txt. Once your program has a
list of students and their respective homework and lab scores, the program
should create five files, A.txt, B.txt, C.txt, D.txt, F.txt and write the names
and overall scores of each student to the file corresponding to their overall
letter grade.   

  This lab must make use of the Student class provided in the
Pre-Lab.  

  Note: Remember to handle file not found exceptions. See Pre-Lab
for how.  

  The following calculation can be used to get grades:  

  Homework Percent can thus
be calculated as:  

  Homework_Points/num_of_assignments  

  Lab Percent can be
calculated in the same way:  

  Lab_Points/
num_of_assignments  

      Student�s overall score will be computed using
the following formula  

  HW_Score_Percent * .5 +
Lab_Score_Percent * .5  

  The input files are formatted as a name followed by a tab followed
by a score.  

      i.e. Name + �\t� + Homework_Score + Lab_Score +
�\n�  

  The output files should be formatted:  

  student.name +
"\n" + "Overall_Percent: " + str(overall_percent) + "%
\n"  

  The Breakpoints for each file are:  

      A.txt:  

          overall_percent &gt;= 90  

      B.txt:   

          90 &gt; overall_percent
&gt;= 80  

  C.txt:   

          80 &gt; overall_percent
&gt;= 70  

      D.txt:   

          70 &gt; overall_percent
&gt;= 60  

      F.txt:   

          60 &gt; overall_percent
