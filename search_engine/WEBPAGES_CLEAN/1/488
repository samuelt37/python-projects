                 Overview 
                 
                    In this demonstration, we use our framework to optimize a video streaming application running on 
                    a Compaq iPAQ. The system architecture assumed is similar to the one shown in the picture below. To
                    simplify matters, we assume that the proxy is also the server streaming the video. The 
                    Dynamo middleware framework executes on both the proxy and the mobile device(iPAQ). The iPAQ runs
                    power-aware operating system and which is capable of performing voltage/frequency scaling 
                    operations. The proxy (Linux desktop) has a streaming server that also doubles as a transcoder 
                    that can dynamically change the quality of the video stream. The transcoder also interfaces with 
                    the Dynamo middleware, through which the video quality can be changed on the fly.
                 
                   
                 
                    As soon as the client requests the server for the video stream, the Dynamo middleware gathers 
                    system state information (residual battery, system load etc.) from the iPAQ and communicates it 
                    to the middleware on the proxy. Using this information, the proxy middleware dynamically determines 
                    at what quality video should be streamed to the device. This is calculated based on the 
                    instantaneous residual energy of the device, the profiled energy usage for the video for the iPAQ,
                    the current load etc. The middleware on the proxy simultaneously sends stream related control 
                    information (e.g. new video quality, WCET, period etc. which have been profiled for the video) 
                    back to the iPAQ. The Dynamo middleware on the iPAQ now relays this information to the Power 
                    Aware OS, which dynamically adjusts the voltage/frequency parameters to work with the new 
                    video quality. For the demo, we use our own H.263 video player and transcoder (developed in house).
                 

                 Whats Needed 
                  Arm tool chain arm-linux/2.95.3 
                     Dynamo Middleware Package 
                     ARM X11 libraries 
                  Configuration 
                 
                 Step 0: Download the Demo   Download  the demo program. Then extract the files 
                type "tar -zxvf demo.tgz". You will obtain a file structure similar to:  
                File Structure:
                   Dynamo
                          middleware
                                  lib 
                                  
                             paapi
                                  user-level [user level dvs] 
                                     kernel-level [kernel level dvs] 
                                     linux-ipaq-v0.6.1 [kernel with dvs] 
                                  
                          
                   Step 1: Configuring the Make Process  
                Open Dynamo\config.mk  
                find and modify  LOCAL_PATH = /root/releases/dynamo_mw_1.0 
                to the path of the dynamo directory  
                find and modify
                 ARM_X11     = /usr/local/arm/X11R6 
                to the path of your local arm X11 libraries  
                find and modify if necessary
                 LINUXKERNELSRC    = /usr/src/linux/kernel 
                to the /path/to/your/proxy/linuxdistro/src/ that is used by the proxy [this will probably not
                                have to be change]
                                
                                   Step 2: Updating Header Files  
                There are 3 files that need to be modified to use the FORGE/Dynamo Middleware Framework.
                These are device.c [middleware on your client device] proxy.c [middleware on the 
                proxy device] dyncommunication.c [shared information between proxy and device].  
                
                dyncommunication.h 
                [all define's and structures can be modified in this header file]
                    
                 #define MOBILEIP 
                defines the mobile device's IP address, configure this to the current 
                mobile ip address   #define PROXYIP 
                defines the proxy's IP addressconfigure this to the current 
                mobile ip address
                                   Step 3: Compiling the Kernel  [or download the  zImage ] 
                                Compile Boot Image:
                                in dynamo 
                                run: make kernel
                                   Step 4: Updating the Kernel  

                cd paapi/linux-ipaq-v0.6.1/arch/arm/boot/
                                Copy the zImage to the mobile device's boot sector and link the new zImage to the current zImage with
                                ln -s /boot/zImage-paapi /boot/zImage
                                   Step 5: Making The Middleware Demo  
                    in dynamo 
                    run: make
                                   Step 6: Uploading Files  
                                        [located in dynamo/middleware] 
                    upload the device file to your iPAQ 
                    upload the proxy file &amp; FOREMAN.H263 to the proxy machine   Step 7: Running the Demo  
                    run ./proxy [on the proxy]  
                    run ./device [on the device]
