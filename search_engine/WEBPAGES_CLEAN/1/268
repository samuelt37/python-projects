Nearest neighbors
 
   Iterated nearest neighbors and finding minimal polytopes . 
D. Eppstein and 
 J. Erickson . 
Tech. Rep. 92-71, ICS, UCI, 1992.  
 4th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,  Austin, 1993, pp. 64–73 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  11: 321–350, 1994 .
 
Showed that for various optimization criteria, the
optimal polygon containing  k  of  n 
points must be near one of the points, hence one can transform
time bounds involving several factors of  n 
to bounds linear in  n  but polynomial in  k. 
Used as a subroutine are data structures for finding several
 nearest neighbors  in rectilinear metric spaces, and
algorithms for finding the
 deepest point in an arrangement  of cubes or
spheres.

    Dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees and extrema of binary functions . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-05 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Tech. Rep. 92-88 , ICS, UCI, 1992.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  13: 111–122, 1995 .
 
Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
 minimum spanning tree  can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt  n ) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

    Dynamic algorithms for half-space reporting, proximity problems, and
geometric minimum spanning trees .  P.K. Agarwal ,
D. Eppstein, and
 J. Matoušek .   33rd IEEE Symp. Foundations of
Comp. Sci.,  Pittsburgh, 1992, pp. 80–89 .
 
This conference paper merged my results from
" Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " with results of my co-authors on nearest neighbors
and halfspace range searching.

    Algorithms for proximity problems in higher dimensions .  
M. T. Dickerson  and D. Eppstein.  
 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  5: 277–291, 1996 .
 
Combines a method from
" Provably good mesh generation " for
finding sparse high-dimensional Delaunay triangulations,
a method of Dickerson, Drysdale, and Sack
[" Simple
algorithms for enumerating interpoint distances ", IJCGA 1992]
for using Delaunay
triangulations to search for nearest neighbors,
and a method of Frederickson for speeding up tree-based searches.
The results are fast algorithms for several proximity problems
such as finding the  k  nearest neighbors to each point
in a given point set.

    Parallel construction of quadtrees and quality triangulations .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and 
 S.-H. Teng .   3rd Worksh. Algorithms and Data
Structures,  Montreal, 1993 . 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  709, 1993, pp. 188–199. 
Tech. Rep. 614, MIT Lab. for Comp. Sci., 1994.   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl. 
9 (6): 517–532, 1999. 
 
A parallelization of the quadtree constructions in
" Provably good mesh generation ",
in an integer model of computation, based on a technique of
sorting the input points using values formed by shuffling the binary
representations of the coordinates.
A side-effect is an efficient construction for the "fair split tree"
hierarchical clustering method used by Callahan and Kosaraju for various
nearest neighbor problems.

    The diameter of nearest neighbor graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-76 , ICS, UCI, 1992.
 
Any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter  D  has O( D  6 ) vertices.  This was
later further
improved to O( D  5 ) and merged with results of Paterson
and Yao into " On nearest neighbor graphs ".

    On nearest-neighbor graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. S. Paterson ,
and F. F. Yao.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  17: 263–282, 1997 .
 
Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things
that any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter  D  has O( D  9 ) vertices.
This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists
of improving that bound to O( D  5 ), which is tight.
