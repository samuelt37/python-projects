  CGAL::Mode  
 

  Definition 
 

All classes in the C GAL  kernel provide input and output operators for
IOStreams.  The basic task of such an operator is to produce a
representation of an object that can be written as a sequence of
characters on devices as a console, a file, or a pipe. The  enum    Mode   distinguish between three different printing formats.
  

In    ASCII   mode, numbers 
e.g. the coordinates of a point or
the coefficients of a line, are written
in a machine independent format. 
In  BINARY  mode, data are written
in a binary format, e.g. a double is represented
as a sequence of four byte. The format depends on the machine.
 The mode   PRETTY 
serves mainly for debugging as the type of the geometric
object is written, as well as the data defining the object. For example
for a point at the origin with  Cartesian  double coordinates, the output
would be  PointC2(0.0, 0.0) .  At the moment C GAL  does not
provide input operations for pretty printed data. By default a stream
is in A SCII  mode.
