  CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge  
 

  Definition 
 

A shalfedge is a great arc on a sphere map. 
Figure 
     

depicts the relationship between a shalfedge and its incident
shalfedges, svertices, and sfaces on a sphere map.  A shalfedge is 
an oriented sedge between two svertices. It is always paired with a 
shalfedge pointing in
the  opposite  direction. The  twin()  member function returns
this shalfedge of  opposite   orientation .
  

  
     
      
            Figure: 
     
 

The  snext()  member function points 
to the  successor  shalfedge around this sface while the  sprev()  member 
function points to the preceding shalfedge.  An
successive assignments of the form  se = se-&gt;snext()  cycles
counterclockwise around the sface (or hole).
  

Similarly, the successive
assignments of the form  se = se-&gt;snext()-&gt;twin()  cycle
clockwise around the svertex and traverse all halfedges incident to
this svertex. The assignment  se = se-&gt;cyclic_adj_succ()  can be 
used as a shortcut.
  

The role of shalfedges in a facet is illustrated in 
Figure 
     
. The  facet()  member function returns the facet 
in which
the shalfedge is part of one of the facet cycles. The successive assignment of 
the form  se = se-&gt;next()  cycles counterclockwise around the facet (or a
hole of the facet).
  

A const circulators is provided for each of the three circular orders.
The circulators are bidirectional and assignable to  SHalfedge_const_handle .

  Types 
 

The following types are the same as in   Nef_polyhedron_3 &lt;Traits&gt; .
  

    
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::Mark
         
              
    type of mark.
 

          
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::Sphere_circle
         
              
    sphere circle type stored in SHalfedge.
 

          
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::Halffacet_const_handle
         
              
    const handle to Halffacet.
 

     
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::SVertex_const_handle
         
              
    const handle to SVertex.
 

     
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::SHalfedge_const_handle
         
              
    const handle to SHalfedge.
 

     
          Nef_polyhedron_3&lt;Traits&gt;::SHalfedge ::SFace_const_handle
         
              
    const handle to SFace.
 

     

  Creation 
 

There is no need for a user to create a  SHalfedge  explicitly. The
class   Nef_polyhedron_3 &lt;Traits&gt;  manages the needed shalfedges internally.
