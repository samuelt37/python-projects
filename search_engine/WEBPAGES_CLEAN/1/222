Universal Point Sets
 
 
Jack Cheng
 

 
A set of points on the plane is an n-universal point set if every
planar graph on n vertices can be embedded in the set without creating
edge crossings.  I will discuss some previously known results about
universal point sets.  Then I will present a new construction based on
213-superpatterns that gives a factor of two improvement over
currently known upper bounds on the size of universal point sets. This
is joint work with Bannister, Devanny, and Eppstein.
