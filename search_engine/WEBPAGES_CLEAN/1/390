  aolibPE step-by-step instructions 
     In the following we provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the  aolibPE  algorithm on an example problem instance. This example is based on Windows, but the steps for Linux are almost the same.       
  Downloading and running the algorithm 
     Download the archive with the executable from the algorithm's  page . Since we assume a Windows operating system here, we need  this  file.       Unpack the archive contents (the binary and a sample parameter file) into a directory of your choice, say  C:\aolib\ .       Obtain an  Ergo  file of a  P(e)  problem instance, for instance from our local  Repository . For this example we pick  BN_11  from the UAI'06 competition. Don't forget to download the respective  evidence  file, too.       The problem instance and evidence file come in gzip'ed form, so unpack them to the same directory as the algorithm executable; in our case  C:\aolib\ .  1        Open a command line (In Windows: Choose "Run" in the start menu and enter  cmd ) and navigate to the directory where we put the files by entering  cdÂ C:\aolib\ .       Run the algorithm by specifying the problem file, the evidence file, the parameter file and the output file, as described on the algorithm's  page . We'll use the parameter file that comes with the program file. If we wish to have the result output into the file  BN_11.out , the command line call in our case will be (all on one line):                   aolibPE
      BN_11.erg
      BN_11.erg.evid
      paramsPE.txt
      BN_11.out      
  Algorithm output 
   The algorithm will run and, depending on the speed of your computer, the result should be returned shortly afterwards. The output should look somewhat like this:                                                                                                           [elim = 10]
  [iBound = 22]
  [be = 1]
  [usePruning = 0]iBound = 22
  usePruning = 0
  SWITCH TO BE = true
  file = BN_11.simple
   Starting to read file ... 
   Done reading file.

If your archiver doesn't support GZIP, a copy of gunzip for the command line is available [ http://csp.ics.uci.edu/files/gunzip.exe  here].
