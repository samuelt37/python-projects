 Since many of you requested, here is solutions to HW6 :  Attach:HW6Sol.pdf 
Note, that they haven't been checked by professor yet.

 HW 6, problem 2 has a confusing first line:
"For this part of the homework, we will a more complete set of data"
 
 specifically: "we will a more complete"
Is there a typo here?
  Apparently so.  Try "we will use a more complete".

 It is slightly disappointing that SVMs have been removed from the syllabus. If possible, it would be fun to have these kept on. :)
  Hi; I don't know that they will be removed, but schedule hit enough flux that I just moved everything down to try to reorganize.  I still hope to talk a bit about SVMs, but they probably won't make it into a homework.

 I may have missed whenever it was explained in class, but what is the nature of "Bonus1" as regards grades/extra credit? Is it purely optional to increase our grades? And what is the approx. value of it compared to other hw? (I have a very busy weekend/week ahead of me and would like to better evaluate how much effort to put into Bonus1)
Thanks,
-Daniel Hebert
   Bonus homework values are directly added to your homework score, so they can replace points lost on earlier (or later) homeworks, or fill in (to proportionally lesser value) for points on the midterm or final exam.

  For Bonus HW #3, I apparently have a typo in the "linear regression" classifier function -- simply transpose each usage of Xtrain, and hopefully that will fix the problem.  I will update the homework itself when I get a chance.

 I am in my office on Mondays - any time 
and Tuesdays 1:00pm - 6:00pm. 
You can stop by any time, but it would be good if you can email me in advance if you plan to stop by.
 
 My office is ICS468B.
 
 Other than Mondays and Tuesdays I am available via email only.

 Slides from discussion section 1  Attach:DS1.pdf  . However, for introduction to Matlab I would encourage to have a look at the links posted on the class website.
Discussion section 2 didn't have any slides because I was showing the demonstration in matalb.

 It would be great if, after the midterm, the homework could return to being due on Wednesday.
   Yes, I would prefer that as well, and will aim to do so.  However, you can always finish the homework on Wednesday and turn it in; any additional time, such as with HW3, should only be helpful.

 Thanks for answering my question to Homework 1 A WEEK AFTER THE ASSIGNMENT WAS DUE!
   Perhaps you're not reloading the page -- according to the wiki history, your HW1 question was answered on 1/14, the day after it was written. 
 
 And we're STILL waiting for the TA to post his slides on this site.
   I'll ask him to take care of this, but in the future it might be effective to simply ask again, nicely, by email.

 Thank you for giving us a second chance at hmw2. I just finished the additional problem and it was EXTREMELY helpful.
   Great; I'm glad to hear it was useful. :)

 Problem 1 on the homework is a problem. I can't seem to sync the green and blue plots to the original data.
 
 I'm using the command: 
plot(X(:,1:2), 'k.');
... to plot the original data.
 
 The command 
plot(X(find(Y==0)), 'ro');
.. highlights the data correctly.
 
 but the command
plot(X(find(Y==1)), 'gt');
... does not highlight the data correctly. It's offset by 50. I'm stumped. What am I doing wrong?
   You need to specify both x &amp; y coordinates, e.g.: plot(X(find(Y==1),1),X(find(Y==1),2), 'gt'); You should be doing this for the other examples as well.  If you look at "size(X(find(Y==1)))" you'll see it is not Nx2, but just 1xN or so.

 Will the TA post his slides on the web page?
