    public class  ObjectStore 
    extends  Object 
   
This is the object for caching Teamware Foundation level objects
from disk. Objects are stored incore, until changes are made to
that object, then they are written out to the local directory
specified by the environment variable TMW_PERSIST externally and
ObjectClass.tmw_obj_store internally.
