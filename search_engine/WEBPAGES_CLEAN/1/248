       What is EcoRaft? 
       The
EcoRaft Project is an interactive educational environment designed to
teach people about restoration ecology through a hands-on interface.
The project integrates stationary monitors and mobile tablet PCs that
allow participants to move species between virtual islands easily and fluidly.
EcoRaft demonstrates the principle that it is easy to destroy an
ecosystem - restoring it takes more work. With lifelike creatures,
colorful visuals and a novel interface, EcoRaft showcases a merging of
computing, arts, ecology, and education. A prototype of the project
showed at SIGGRAPH 2005 in  the Emerging Technologies program .

        Who is EcoRaft? 
       The
project is a collaboration between Professors Bill Tomlinson and Lynn
Carpenter at the University of California, Irvine. The technological
platform on which it stands has been in development in various
incarnations for several years; the EcoRaft direction began development
in the spring of 2005. More information about them and their students
who also work on the project can be found on the  EcoRaft Group  page.       
 The group also maintains a  research blog .
