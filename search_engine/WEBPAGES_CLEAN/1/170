  Replicators : B01368/S03 

  
B01368/S03  has a 5c/10 replicator formed by a three-cell
block: 

     

 Unlike many other known replicators, this one turns into an
  oscillator when stabilized by replicators in adjacent positions in its
  row. Thus, a single replicator will eventually grow to form a
  one-dimensional row of copies of itself without gaps. Random patterns
  in this rule eventually fill the plane with a chaotic grid of
  interacting vertical and horizontal rows of replicators; when the
  initial fraction of random live cells is approximately 38%, this grid pattern
  will be confined within slowly-annealing boundaries between large
  regions of the plane with the same parity (live replicator cells on
  dead background in even generations and dead on live in odd
  generations, or vice versa). 

 Two parallel replicators can interact to form a breeder that leaves perpendicular trails of replicators behind them, producing a quadratic growth pattern: 

     


 The replicator for this rule also forms the basis of this 5c/10 spaceship:
