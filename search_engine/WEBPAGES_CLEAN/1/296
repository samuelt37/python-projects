    public class  Architecture 
    extends  Component 
   
A C2 architecture is a network of components hooked together by
connectors.  Components and connectors may be added to an architecture,
removed from it, welded together, and detached from each other. 
Hierarchical architectures are supported by allowing an entire
architecture to act as a single component in a new, bigger
architecture.    
NOTE: This class should not be used directly.  Use either 
SimpleArchitecture or one of its derived classes.
