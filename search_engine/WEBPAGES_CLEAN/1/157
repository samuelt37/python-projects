Outline    

       

  A hands on TCP/IP lab course
that emphasizes the main networking concepts 
taught in ICS 153 or ICS 243A. The lab is structured around exercises that
highlight topics such as addressing, subnetting, bridging, ARP, routing (RIP,
OSPF), TCP, ICMP, etc. The course consists of 8 weeks of labs. Every week a
series of exercises are required to be completed. Lab reports are used to
evaluate the students’ understanding of the material and document the
exercises. Students are required to review ICS 153 or ICS 243A material for
each lab. An accompanying text will used and for each exercise the relevant
chapters will be given.
