     Class BaseDBPopulator    Base class to take some kind of input data (probably a file), iterate 
  through it's contents and process it accordingly, possibly calculating 
  and formatting different values and then submitting them for output 
  (probably a database). 
   The core structure is in the run method, leaving most of the details 
  to independent processor and iterator preparer objects for each table.  
  Standard ones are included in this module, but additional processors can 
  be created and added for customized curation / processing. 
  The structure of the run method will likely have dependence and map to
  the schema structure of the output (database), and thus should be 
  overridden and customized by sub-classes

     __init__ ( self ) 
      (Constructor) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Constructor.  Initialize processor object dictionaries to empty, and 
  expected processor lists to empty lists. Sub-class should override.
        
  
 
   
     
     loadOptions ( self ,
         options ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Load any relevant options from the command-line parser. Sub-class 
  should override.
        
  
 
   
     
     prepareIterator ( self ,
         tableName ,
         parentObj ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Given a tableName, look for an iterator preparer object previously set
  in the preparerDict.  Assuming it exists, Run the preparer given the 
  parent object for this set of "children" to iterate over.
        
  
 
   
     
     processObject ( self ,
         tableName ,
         parentObj ,
         currObj ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Given a tableName, look for a list of processor objects previously 
  added in the processorsDict.  Run each of these processors on the current
  object (currObj), passing its "parent" object as well to 
  provide contextual information.
        
  
 
   
     
     run ( self ) 
   
     
     
     Primary method that traverses through the database schema, populating 
  it with the input data as it goes.  High level function. Details are left
  to independent processor objects. 
  Sub-class MUST override this to follow the respective customized 
  schema structure
