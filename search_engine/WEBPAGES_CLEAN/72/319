 Distances in graphs and graphs defined by distances 
 David Eppstein, Computer Science 295, Spring 2008 

 The course will meet Monday and Wednesdays, 1:00 - 1:50, in CS
243. Grading will be attendance-based.

  Tentative schedule of topics: 

  Week I. Organizational meeting; survey of textbook shortest path
algorithms. BFS, Depth-first iterative deepening, Dijkstra,
Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall. 

 Week II. Fast matrix multiplication. Unweighted undirected shortest
paths using matrix multiplication [ Seidel, STOC 1992 ]; Subcubic algorithms for all pairs shortest
paths with small integer weights [ Zwick, JACM 2002 ]. 

 Week III. Combinatorial algorithms for integer weights. Undirected
integer weight shortest paths in linear time [ Thorup, JACM 1999 ]. Unweighted shortest paths with small additive error in subcubic
time, not based on matrix multiplication [ Aingworth et al, SICOMP 1999 ]. 

 Week IV. Parametric shortest paths [Gusfield; Carstenson;  Young et al. ;  Eppstein, SICOMP
2003 ; Eppstein and Wortman].  

  Week V. Faster negative cycle detection by scaling
[ Goldberg,
SICOMP 1995 ]; k shortest paths [ Eppstein, SICOMP 1998 ]. 

 Week VI. Dynamic all-pairs shortest paths [ Demetrescu and Italiano, JACM 2004 ;  Thorup, STOC 2005 ]; Distance oracles [ Thorup and Zwick, JACM 2005 ] 

 Week VII. Graphs defined by distances: Distance-hereditary
graphs. Recognition, characterization, and confluent drawing. 

 Week VIII. Partial cubes: definition and characterization. Bound on
number of edges; quadratic-time shortest path algorithm and recognition. 

 Week IX. NO CLASS MONDAY (Memorial Day holiday). Lattice dimension of
partial cubes. 

 Week X. Median graphs and squaregraphs.
