 1. Suppose we wish to solve the problem of, given data points in the
plane, listing all points contained in a query triangle.  We attempt to
solve it with the following data structure:

- We partition the points into a set of nested convex hulls:
  H_0 is the convex hull of the input, H_1 is the hull of the points
  other than the ones already vertices H_0, and in general
  H_i is the hull of the points other than the ones that are already
  vertices of some hull H_j for j
