 Property URL encoding (cont�d)<body>

  Property URL encoding (cont�d)  
      Recommended solution
 
  do not provide a standard URL encoding scheme like ;DAV/ (but servers can support this if they wish)
  return URL of property as in the PropLoc attribute of the &lt;Prop&gt; tag (which is a container tag for a property description), if the server supports a mapping of properties to URLs (it doesn�t have to)
