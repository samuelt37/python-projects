       Course Goals 
        Constraint satisfaction is a
simple but powerful tool. Constraints identify the impossible and
reduce the realm of possibilities to effectively focus on the possible,
allowing for a natural declarative formulation of what must be
satisfied, without expressing how. The field of constraint reasoning
has matured over the last three decades with contributions from a
diverse community of researchers in artificial intelligence, databases
and programming languages, operations research, management science, and
applied mathematics.
       The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the
theory and techniques of constraint processing, using the constraint
graphical model. This model offers a natural language for encoding
world knowledge in areas such as scheduling, vision, diagnosis,
prediction, design, hardware and software verification, and bio-informatics, and it
facilitates many computational tasks relevant to these domains such as
constraint satisfaction, constraint optimization, counting and sampling


. The course will
focus on techniques for constraint processing. It will cover search and
inference algorithms, consistency algorithms and structure based
techniques and will focus on properties that facilitate efficient
solutions. Extensions to general graphical models
such as probabilistic networks, cost networks, and influence diagrams
will be discussed
as well as example applications such as temporal reasoning, diagnosis,
scheduling, and prediction.
