In message &lt;199608310041.RAA23761@spice.perforce.com&gt;, Christopher Seiwald writ

&gt;Clearly the URL is not sufficient: multiple users can be working on the
&gt;same document.
&gt;
&gt;URL+username might be better, but I can easily imagine a case where the
&gt;same named user (or the same user) is working on a single document from
&gt;two different places.
&gt;
&gt;URL+username+hostname?  Maybe.

This is what Derived-From: and Version: are all about: in
response to a GET (for edit), the server emits Version: ... .

In the corresponding PUT, the client includes Derived-From: ... .

See Dave Long's draft for details.
