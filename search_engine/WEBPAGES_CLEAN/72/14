The OEQAtomBase class is the abstract interface for representing atoms
and atom expressions within OEChem.  For a description of query
expressions and their utility in graph matching refer to
(Section  3.1 ).  OEQAtomBases are created by calling the
OEQMolBase::NewAtom method.  Please refer to the OEAtomBase
(Section  3.1 ) and OEQBase sections for descriptions of
the methods inherited by OEQAtomBase.
