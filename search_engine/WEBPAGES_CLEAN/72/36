  Our Approach  
      Uniform semantic base
 
  model both architectural structure and abstract behavior
  permits analysis of interactions between the two
       Syntactic separation between reconfiguration and �steady-state� behavior
 
  localizes reconfiguration changes
  separates concerns
       Limit specifications to common case of finite sets of configurations
 
  supports static analysis
