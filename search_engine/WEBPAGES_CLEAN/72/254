         Johnson named ISBA Fellow</strong>
              Statistics Professor Wesley Johnson is recognized for his research contributions, longstanding service to the Bayesian community.
    
                    
Statistics Professor  Wesley Johnson</strong> has been named a  fellow  of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA). Johnson is specifically recognized for his “fundamental research contributions to Bayesian predictive modeling, Bayesian regression through informative prior elicitation and diagnostics, Bayesian nonparametrics, diagnostic screening tests, and biostatistical and veterinary applications; for exceptional mentoring, advising and teaching; and for longstanding service to the Bayesian community,” the ISBA says.

  
The ISBA promotes the development and application of Bayesian analysis useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in science, industry and government. It also sponsors and organizes meetings of the Bayesian community and publishes the electronic journal   Bayesian Analysis  .

  
The first cohort of ISBA fellows were recognized on the 20th anniversary of the ISBA’s founding to honor the members of the first board of directors and other individuals who were instrumental in the organization’s creation. Today, ISBA fellows are members who have made outstanding contributions in some aspect of statistical work, including publication, teaching and public service. Fellows are elected by an eight-person committee of past fellows on a biannual basis.

  
Johnson was formally inducted as an ISBA fellow at the June 2016  ISBA World Meeting  in Sardinia, Italy.
