&gt; ...I'm not even suggesting
&gt; replacing the versioning concept with this configuration concept.  I'm
&gt; just more interested in this level above versioning and am wondering
&gt; if that concept should be included in the discussions.

Second the motion: I think we need to talk about both versions and
configurations. They serve different audiences and they probably get
implemented at different levels.

Let's distinguish between the needs of the website developer/maintainer
and those of the website visitor. As a CM supplier I want to give the
developer access to raw versions of elements in the repository (as well
as to configurations). As a webmaster I may want to restrict visitors'
access only to whole configurations.

Decorated URLs in the MKS style may suffice for the simple versioning
needs. But I suspect we'll want to look at an additional HTTP method --
call it SET_CONFIG -- to tell a server, "Now switch to serving the
'tables-no-frames' version of the pages."
