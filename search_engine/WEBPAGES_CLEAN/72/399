     DataVault is an architecture designed for
Web users that allows them to securely access their data from any
machine connected to the Internet and also lets them selectively
share their data with trusted peers. The DataVault architecture is
built on the outsourced database model (ODB), where clients/users
outsource their database to a remote service provider who provides
data management services such backup, recovery, transportability and
data sharing. In DataVault, the service provider is untrusted.  The
confidentiality and integrity of the user's data is preserved using
cryptographic techniques. The service provider manages encrypted
data. DataVault utilizes a novel PKI infrastructure and encrypted
storage model that allow data sharing to take place via an untrusted
server.
