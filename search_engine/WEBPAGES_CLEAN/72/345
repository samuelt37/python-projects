Shortest paths in an arrangement with k line orientations 
David Hart, ICS, UC Irvine 

 Suppose one has a line arrangement in which many lines are
parallel, so that the number of different line orientations is k,
and one wants to find a shortest path from one point on a line in
the arrangement to another such point. Using known techniques one
can find the shortest path in time and space O(n 2 ). We
present an algorithm that can find the shortest path in
O(n+k 2 ) time and space.
