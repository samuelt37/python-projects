 Technical Interchange, Roundtable, and Networking Meetings 
 
The success of the 
 
Southern California SPIN  and 
 
Bay Area Roundtable  
have substantiated the need for, and benefits of, regular networking and 
roundtable meetings. An interesting aspect of these meetings is the 
significant value added by holding them on neutral grounds. This fosters 
the unrestrained sharing of ideas and experiences important to community 
development. IRUS will continue to initiate new technical interchange, 
roundtable, and networking meetings modeled after SPIN and BART as their 
need is identified by the IRUS 
 
Executive Committee . 
Potential topics of interest may be prototyped with 
 
Focused Technology Symposia 
to 
substantiate their relevance.
