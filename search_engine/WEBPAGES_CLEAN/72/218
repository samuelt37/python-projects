 This is an old revision of the document!</strong>
 
  
The following questions were asked during phone interviews for tenure-track faculty positions at private liberal arts colleges and Cal State Universities.
 



  General  
 
     Why are you interested in the position at our school?</strong> 
 
   What strengths will you bring to our department and/or school? In other words, tell us why should we hire you? 
 
   If you were to put yourself in our shoes, looking at your CV, what do you think would make us pause, and why is this concern not an actual concern? 
 
   Why would you not want to come to this school? (reasons that might make you hesitate) 
 
  

  Research  
 
     Describe your research (in layman's terms).</strong> 
 
   Why is your research important? 
 
   What were your contributions to your research? 
 
    What are your research plans for the next 2-3 (5) years?</strong> 
 
   How do you intend on conduct research, knowing that you may be the only person in your area in our department? 
 
   Given that the teaching load is 2 courses a semester, and we have no PhD students (to use as minions), how do you plan on remaining active in your research while offering our undergrads excellent instruction? 
 
   Given that the teaching load is 4 courses a semester, and we have no PhD students (to use as minions), how do you plan on remaining active in your research while offering our undergrads excellent instruction? 
 
    How will you involve (non-PhD) students at the undergraduate (and Masters level, depending on the school) in your research?</strong> 
 
  

  Teaching  
 
    Tell us of a time and a specific example when you had trouble explaining a concept and then later found a better way of explaining it. 
 
   (Variant of the same thing) Tell us about your teaching philosophy: describe a moment when you were particularly effective at teaching and what was your approach/thinking? 
 
   What do you love most about teaching? 
 
    What courses do you want to teach?</strong> 
 
   What courses are you able to teach? 
 
   What courses are you not willing to teach? 
 
    Will you be comfortable teaching a course not in your area of expertise?</strong> 
 
   What courses would you be interested in developing? 
 
    Cal States: How do you deal with teaching students of different levels of ability?</strong> 
 
   What are you like in the classroom? 
 
   Describe how you prepare to teach for a class you have never taught before. 
 
  

  Other (rarely asked)  
 
    What would you do to help mentor students from under-represented minorities and women? 
 
   What is your ideal academic environment? 
 
   How will you adjust from your current environment to teaching at our school? 
 
   How will you contribute to our school's mission statement? (Jesuit school)
