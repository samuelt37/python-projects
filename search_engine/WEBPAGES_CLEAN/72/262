				 Catalogue Description  
				223 Applied Software Design Techniques (4). Study of concepts, representations, techniques, and case studies 
				in structuring software systems, with an emphasis on design considerations. Topics include static and dynamic 
				system structure, data models, abstractions, naming, protocols and application programmer interfaces.
				  
				 Structure  
				The class will be discussion-oriented. Papers must have been read beforehand, and discussion will be 
				seeded by questions, observations, and assertions from all students in the class.
				  
				 Case Study  
				Each student will perform a case study by adopting one software system that they will use to illustrate 
				the techniques with concrete examples. Based on the case study, a few slides should be prepared weekly that 
				illustrate the findings in the example system.
				  
				 Design practice  
				Each student will engage in the design of several software systems (or parts thereof), putting the lessons learned 
                into practice.
				  
				 Grades  
				All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class 
				attendance and participation, (b) questions, observations, and assertions that feed the 
                discussions in class, (c) case study slides, and (d) design work.

				 Students with Disabilities  
				Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the 
				impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her 
				specific needs.  Also contact the Disability Services Center at 
				(949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such 
				accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
