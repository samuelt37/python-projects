 Cellular Automata: Replicators 

A  replicator  is usually defined as a cellular automaton
pattern which can make copies of itself. This definition is
somewhat vague, but there are so few examples known that it would
be unhelpful to try to be more precise. Replicators are interesting
not only in themselves, but because they can be used to build many
other types of patterns: high-period oscillators, glider guns,
puffers and spaceships, and pseudo-random number generators. 

 Most replicators work accoding to a  parity rule:  there is
a (usually one-dimensional) grid of possible replicator positions,
such that, if replicators are placed at certain grid positions,
they produce new replicators at the positions with an odd number of
replicators in neighboring cells. If the grid positions are spaced
k units apart, and the period (number of generations between each
replication) is p, then the resulting pattern of oscillators
expands at a speed of kc/p, with a  sawtooth  growth rate in
which the number of active cells repeatedly increases to linear (or
quadratic, for two dimensional grids) then decreases to a constant.
The minima of the number of active cells occur at generations that
are powers of two times the period. 

 Parity-rule replicators are fairly common in rules with B1
(birth on a single neighbor, in  standard
semitotalistic notation ), but those rules are not very
interesting because any pattern quickly grows to infinity in all
directions, so gliders, oscillators, and similar structures are
impossible. The more interesting rules are those with B0, B2 or B3, in
which gliders are possible (and  many gliders are
known ). Among these rules, only the following replicators are
known:

  It is believed that   B3/S23 
(Conway's Life)  and   B35/S236  
also support replicators due to  construction universality , but
explicit replicators for those rules have not been constructed.
