         Tsudik receives $407,000 Army Research Office grant </strong>
          
                    
Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science  Gene Tsudik</strong> was awarded a $407,000 grant from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's  Army Research Office  (ARO) in September 2016 for his project, “Remote Attestation of Critical Infrastructure Components.” The project focuses on mitigation of malware infestations and other attacks on swarms or groups of heterogeneous embedded systems and/or Internet of Thing (IoT) devices.
 
  
ARO’s mission is to serve as the Army's extramural basic research agency in the engineering, physical, information and life sciences; developing and exploiting innovative advances to insure the nation's technological superiority. Basic research proposals from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations and private industry are competitively selected and funded. ARO's research mission represents the most long-range Army view for changes in its technology.
