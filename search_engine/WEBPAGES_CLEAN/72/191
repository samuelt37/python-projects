  Possible Game Projects 

Here are some possible games to choose among for your
 project proposals .
They all fit the criteria of having simple rules but complicated play,
no chance or hidden information, and a reasonably small number of
choices at each step.

   Amazons .

     Checkers .

     Connect-4 .
This is a tic-tac-toe like game in which players drop pieces
onto columns and try to get four in a row.

     Go-Moku , a game like tic-tac-toe involving
forming lines of pieces, but played on a much larger board.

     Fanorona  looked like such a good
game that I programmed it myself!

a game played on a diamond-shaped board of hexagonal cells,
in which each player tries to form a path of cells from one side of the
board to the other.
