    Analyzing F.R.I.E.N.D.S. 


 
   
    August 2013 to Current
   
  
   This is a product of being a big fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and a software engineer. :) I want to see if i can find something interesting by running some basic text analysis and statistics on the transcripts of the episodes. 

 questions that i am trying to answer: 
- Who speaks the most? 
- Summaries of individual episodes? 
- Summaries of what each F.R.I.E.N.D.S. said? 

 Code:  https://github.com/VijayKrishna/friends_analysis  

 

  TL;DR  - Who speaks the most? Summaries of individual episodes or what each F.R.I.E.N.D. said.
