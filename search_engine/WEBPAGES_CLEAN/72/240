   Let $G$ be a six-vertex graph formed from a square $abcd$ and a
triangle $cde$ that share an edge, together with one more edge $ef$
attached to the third vertex of the triangle. Describe the sequence of
all the recursive calls that would be performed by the pivoting version
of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm on this graph. For each call,
describe the three sets given as arguments to the call, the pivot vertex
$u$ chosen by the call, the list of vertices $v$ corresponding to the
recursive calls that this call makes, and any maximal clique that is
produced as output by the call.  
  What are the degeneracy, $h$-index, and clustering coefficient of
the same graph $G$ given in the previous problem?  
  Suppose that we are generating simulated social-network data by
using the Barabasi-Albert method, with parameter $k$: we start with a
$k$-vertex clique and at each step add a new vertex connected to exactly
$k$
previous vertices (chosen with probabilities in proportion to their
degrees). Suppose also that we do this for exactly $9k$ steps, so that we
end up with a graph that has $10k$ vertices.
Define the diameter of a graph to be the largest unweighted distance
between any two of its vertices. What is the smallest possible diameter
of a graph that
can be generated in this way? Describe how a graph with this diameter
could be generated, and why no smaller diameter is possible.  
  Use the MathSciNet collaboration distance calculator to find five
mathematicians, whose collaboration distances from Paul Erdös are
respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. To find the distance for an author: go
to the  author
search  feature of MathSciNet (from a UCI IP address, so that you
will be given subscription access to the database), enter the name of a
mathematician, click on the "Collaboration Distance" link in the results
page, hit the "use Erdös" button in the collaboration distance
page, and hit the search button. What is the shortest path from each of
your mathematicians to Erdös? What is the largest collaboration
distance you can find in this way?
