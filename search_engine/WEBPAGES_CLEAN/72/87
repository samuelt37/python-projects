  Abstract  

Current research indicates that software reliability needs to be achieved 
through the careful integration of a number of diverse testing and 
analysis techniques. To address this need, the TEAM environment has 
been designed to support the integration of and experimentation with
an ever growing number of software testing and analysis tools. To achieve 
this flexibility, we exploit three design principles: component technology 
so that common underlying functionality is recognized; generic realizations 
so that these common functions can be instantiated as diversely as
possible; and language independence so that tools can work on multiple 
languages, even allowing some tools to be applicable to different phases 
of the software lifecycle. 

 

The result is an environment that contains building blocks for easily 
constructing and experimenting with new testing and analysis techniques. 
Although the first prototype has just recently been implemented, we feel 
it demonstrates how modularity, genericity, and language independence 
further extensibility and integration.
