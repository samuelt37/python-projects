   How to compile XLOGP?</strong>  

      The XLOGP program is written in C++
language and can run on UNIX / LINUX or DOS platform. 

     To compile XLOGP, first you need to decrypt
the file. You must do this in a UNIX / LINUX shell like this: 

         
     crypt  key &lt; xlogp.tar.Z.en &gt;
xlogp.tar.Z  

      Then,
you need to uncompress the file:  

         
     uncompress  xlogp.tar.Z  

      The third step is to
unpack the file:  

       
       tar  xvf  xlogp.tar  

      Now you will see that
a directory named "  xlogp2.0  " has been created in your working
directory. Under that directory, there are two subdirectories:
"  xlogp  " and "  manual  ". The subdirectory "  xlogp  " contains
the source codes of XLOGP v2.0 while the subdirectory "  manual  "
contains this manual.   

      Please go into the
subdirectory "  xlogp  ". You will find the following files in that
directory:   

   Makefile
                  
        compiling script  
      xlogp.c
                   
        source codes, in C++  
      molecule.c        
         source codes, in C++  
      xlogp.h
                   
        source codes, in C++  
      xlogp
                     
        executable code of XLOGP for SGI workstation  
      xlogp.exe          
        executable code of XLOGP for DOS   
      cygwin1.dll        
        DLL file necessary for running xlogp.exe  
      melatonin.mol2     
        an example compound, in Mol2 format  
       To compile the source
codes, please run the compiling script "Makefile" by:  

     
         make  

      The
"Makefile" script will compile the source codes
automatically and finally generate an executable code named as
"  xlogp  ". Please notice that the default C++
compiler assigned in the "Makefile" script is SGI
"CC" compiler. If you are using a different C++
compiler on your computer, e.g. "g++", you should
change the first line in the file "Makefile" as
"CC = g++".   

      If you do not have
any C++ compiler installed on your computer, we have provided the
executable code of XLOGP v2.0, "  xlogp  ",  in the same directory. It is
compiled on a SGI O2/R10000 workstation running IRIX6.4. So, if
you happen to use the same kind of computer, you have a good
chance to run "  xlogp  " directly.  

      We have also provided
the executable code of XLOGP for Windows/DOS platform, "  xlogp.exe  ".
Please always remember to keep the file "  cygwin1.dll  "
together with it.
