 Counting-Based Look-Ahead Schemes for
Constraint Satisfaction 

 Kalev Kask, Rina Dechter, and Vibhav Gogate 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a new look-ahead scheme for backtrack-
ing search for solving constraint satisfaction problems. This look-ahead
scheme computes a heuristic for value ordering and domain pruning. The
heuristic is based on approximating the number of solutions extending
each partial solution. In particular, we investigate a recent partition-
based approximation of tree-clustering algorithms, Iterative Join-Graph
Propagation (IJGP), which belongs to the class of belief propagation
algorithms that attracted substantial interest due to their success for
probabilistic inference. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the
counting-based heuristic approximated by IJGP yields a scalable, focused
search.
