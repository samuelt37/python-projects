 Gliders and Spaceships 

 Despite the resemblance of the rules to Life's (differing only
in B5 and S6), none of the usual life  gliders and
spaceships  seem to work here. But the reason I started looking
at B35/S236 was its small 2c/5 glider, which arises spontaneously
from a lot of reactions: 

     

 There are also other 2c/5 spaceships (the second one below has
period 10): 

 
       
     
   

 Many large c/2 spaceships: 

     

 Several large c/3 spaceships: 

     

 c/4, c/5, c/6, and 3c/7 spaceships, and a c/4 diagonal
(glide-reflect) spaceship: 

 
       
     
       
       
       
   

 All three 2c/5 spaceships, and the c/6 spaceship, can be  shot from guns .  Many higher-period c/2 spaceships
can be made using
 Jason Summers' puffer constructions .
