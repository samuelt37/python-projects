bool OEReadPDBFile(oemolistream &amp;ifs, OEMolBase &amp;mol,
                   unsigned int flavor = OEPDBIFlag::DEFAULT)
    
Read a molecule from the specified input stream, ifs, in Brookhaven
PDB file format.  A number of different PDB format variants are
supported by the use of the bits in the ``flavor'' parameter.  This
function returns true if the operation was successful, and false if
an end-of-file was encountered.

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::TER ,  OEPDBIFlag::END  and
 OEPDBIFlag::ENDM  flags are used
to inform the OEChem PDB file reader of the records used to separate
consecutive molecules in a single PDB file.  The flags correspond to
the PDB file format's TER, END and ENDMOD records respectively.  If all
of these flags are turned off, all of the ATOM and HETATM records in a
single PDB file will be read into a single OEMolBase.  By default, only
 OEPDBIFlag::END  and  OEPDBIFlag::ENDM  are on (and
 OEPDBIFlag::TER  is off),
meaning that different chains are read into the a single molecule, but
different NMR models and concatenated PDB files are treated as sequential
molecules.

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::ALL  flag is used to indicate that all of the
atom records in the input file should be read into the OEMolBase.  By
default, the  OEReadPDBFile  function ignores/omits ATOM and HETATM
records that represent pseudo or dummy atoms and/or alternate conformations.
Without  OEPDBIFlag::ALL , the PDB file reader ignores all atoms whose
alternate location indicator is other than  ' ' ,  A  or  1 ,
all atoms with atom names begining  " Q" , all atoms with residue name
 "DUM" , and all atoms with co-ordinates 9999.000, 9999.000, 9999.000
(as used by XPLOR/CNS to represent dummy atoms).

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::DATA  flag is used to instruct the OEChem PDB file
reader to preserve the PDB file's header data in the OEMolBase's generic
data.  This option currently preserves AUTHOR, CAVEAT, COMPND, CRSYT1,
EXPDTA, FORMUL, HEADER, HELIX, HET, HETNAM, HETSYM, JRNL, KEYWDS, MODRES,
OBSLTE, ORIGX1, ORIGX2, ORIGX3, REMARK, REVDAT, SCALE1, SCALE2, SCALE3,
SEQRES, SHEET, SITE, SOURCE, SPRSDE, SSBOND, TITLE and TURN records.
Note that modifying or reordering the molecule may invalidate the atom
serial numbers used in some of the PDB records.

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::CHARGE  flag is used to indicate that the contents
of the b-factor column in the input PDB file contains a partial charge,
and should be stored in the `partial charge' property of an atom, instead
of the `b-factor' property.  This value can then be retrieved using the
 OEAtomBase::GetPartialCharge  method.

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::RADIUS  flag is used to indicate the the contents
of the occupancy column in the input PDB file contains a radius, and
should be stored in the `radius' property of an atom instead of the
`occupancy' property.  This value can then be retrieved using the
 OEAtomBase::GetRadius  method.

  
The  OEPDBIFlag::DELPHI  flag is just the combination of the
 OEPDBIFlag::CHARGE  and  OEPDBIFlag::RADIUS  flags above.
