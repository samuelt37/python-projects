Panel Abstract:  </strong>
The magic date of January 1, 2000 is nearly upon us and no one is really
sure what (if anything) is going to happen as a result of the Y2K bug.
This panel session brings together several panelists with extensive
experience in various aspects of Y2K remediation who will speak about
their own specific work as well as offer their perspective on broader 
issues. We hope to have a lively and enjoyable discussion with lots of 
audience participation.
