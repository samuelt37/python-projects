  Architecture Implementation  
      Memory history buffer
 
  FIFO buffer to record recently missed memory address
  Predict only when there is a hit in the buffer
  Miss stride can be calculated by the relative position of consecutive miss for the same address
  The size of the buffer determines the number of  predictions
       Prefetch buffer (On-chip)
 
  Store the contents of prefetched memory address
  The size of the buffer determines how much we can tolerate the variation of miss stride
       Prefetch scheduler
 
  Select a right time to prefetch
  Avoid collision
       Prefetcher
 
  prefetch the contents of miss address into on-chip prefetch buffer
