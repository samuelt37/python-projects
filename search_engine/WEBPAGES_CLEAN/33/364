     Brief description:  
PIC, Precise Interface Control, extends the visibility constructs 
        of most block-structured languages to support fine-grained access 
        control for modules and types. The PIC-Ada Toolset implements the 
        PIC access control model for Ada.
 
	The toolset contains:
  
	PICAda_to_IRIS- Translates a PIC-Ada submodule to an IRIS
        representation of that submodule.
  
	Generate_Stub- Given a collection of submodules, generates
	a specification stub that is used by those submodules.
  
	Do_Analysis- Performs one of the PIC analyses on a
	submodule or pair of submodules.
  
	View_Analysis- View the results of a PIC analysis.
  
	PIC_Analysis- Drives the entire suite of PIC analyses.
