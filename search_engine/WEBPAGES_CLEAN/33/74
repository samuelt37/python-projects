 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Type Extender  Intent       Type extenders enrich the set of interfaces supplied by a    component.   Also Known As        Other well-known names for the mechanism, if any.     Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Benefits of type extenders include:       Expanded standardized interface for alternative            implementations; Other interfaces pass through to            clients.       Type extenders have the following limitations:        Fixed extensions .        Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses       Microsoft's OLE DB uses type extenders to expose a uniform    set of interfaces for accessing information stores.   Related Mechanisms        What mechanisms are closely related to this one? What    are the important differences? With which other mechanisms    should this one be used?        Backto the Adaptation home page   .
