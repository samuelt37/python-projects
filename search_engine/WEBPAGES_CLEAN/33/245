   Tangent spheres and triangle centers . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/9909152 .   Amer. Math. Monthly  108 (1): 63â€“66, 2001 .
 
Any four mutually  tangent spheres 
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
 compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles ; also available are some
 Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers .
