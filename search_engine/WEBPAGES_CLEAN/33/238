22.9 Predicates as a subset of Functors 
 

 
Obviously, there is no strict requirement that all functors must return
boolean values.  In fact, there is a series of classes in OEChem called
OEFunctions.  They are predefined to be  OEUnaryFunction  and
 OEBinaryFunction .  They have template arguments for both the return
types and argument types and their  operator()  functions are not
necessarily const functions.  OEPredicates inherit from OEFunctions.
