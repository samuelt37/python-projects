We study the problem of splitting the vertices of a given graph into a
bounded number of sub-vertices (with each edge attaching to one of the
sub-vertices) in order to make the resulting graph planar.
It is NP-complete, but can be approximated to within a constant factor,
and is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth.
