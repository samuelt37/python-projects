  Replicators : B3568/S2347 

 I found this replicator on Oct. 27, 2001. It repeats every 4
generations, on a one-dimensional 2-unit grid. 

     

 This rule has  a few known
spaceships . It is unknown whether the replicator can lead to
high-period oscillators, spaceships, guns, or other interesting
technology.
