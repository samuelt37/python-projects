An Optimal Randomized Algorithm for Maximum Tukey Depth
 
Kevin Wortman 
 
 
We present the first algorithm to compute the maximum Tukey 
depth  for a non-degenerate point set in the plane.  The algorithm is 
randomized and requires  O ( n  log  n ) 
expected time for  n  data points.
In a higher fixed dimension  d , greater than or equal to 3, 
the expected time bound is  O ( n d-1  ), 
which is probably optimal as well.  The result is obtained using an 
interesting variant of the author's randomized optimization
technique, capable of solving "implicit" linear-programming-type problems.
