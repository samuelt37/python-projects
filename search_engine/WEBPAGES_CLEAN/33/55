6.1.4 Isotope 
 
The ``isotope'' property of an atom is an unsigned integer used to
indicate whether the atom is mono-isotopic and if so the atomic mass
of the relevant isotope.  The default value is zero, indicating that
the atom has a typical population of isotopes (based upon standard
abundances) for that element.
