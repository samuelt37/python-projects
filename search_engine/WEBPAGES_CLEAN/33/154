Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3. 2002.    a weighted decision rule provides better results than the unweighted rule. Among them, 7 datasets (Balance,  Echocardiogram   German, Horse Colic, Led, Pima and Vehicle) see important improvements, ranging from 1% to } 5%. In contrast, only one dataset sees significant accuracy decrease (Car,       Gabor Melli.  A Lazy Model-Based Approach to On-Line Classification . University of British Columbia. 1989.    The five selected datasets were:  echocardiogram   hayes-roth, heart, horse-colic,andiris datasets. These datasets (marked in Table 7.1 with a * symbol beside their name) contain a sampling of attribute types and domains. For       Federico Divina and Elena Marchiori.

Tables 4 and 5 contain the results of the experiments on the training and test sets, respectively. On the training sets ECL-LSDf obtains the best performance on all datasets, with optimal performance on the  Echocardiogram   However, on the test sets, ECL-LSDc achieves the best accuracy in most of the cases, with simplicity (that is, the number of clauses of the output       D.

However, in the  Echocardiogram  dataset, the RPNN used only 9% of the data while improving generalization accuracy by over 12%. Future research will focus on identifying characteristics of applications that help determine whether the RPNN       Zhi-Hua Zhou and Xu-Ying Liu.
