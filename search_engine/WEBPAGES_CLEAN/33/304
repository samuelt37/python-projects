     Brief description:  
Rebus is a requirements building process
	combining functional requirements with SREM
	style requirements specifications.  Rebus provides
	support for the construction of requirements as a
	hierarchical decomposition of functional requirements.
 
     Evaluation against applicable general dimensions:
