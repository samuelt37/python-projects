  AdaptableFunctor  
 

  Definition The concept   AdaptableFunctor   defines an adaptable functor,
  i.e., a functor that can be used with function object adaptors such
  as binders and composers.
 

  Types 
 

    
          AdaptableFunctor ::result_type
         
              
    return type of the
    functor.
 

          
          AdaptableFunctor ::Arity
         
              
    defines the arity of the functor,
    i.e., the number of arguments it takes. The class has to be a
    specialization of   CGAL::Arity_tag &lt;int&gt; , where the template
    parameter corresponds to the arity of the functor, e.g.
      CGAL::Arity_tag &lt;2&gt;  for binary functors.
 

     

  Operations 
 

    
         
    type0  

         
          
             
    f.operator() (     
    type1 a1, 

type2 a2, 

..., 

typen an)    
     const
         
                
    (as many arguments as defined by  Arity ) 

returns
     f(a1,...an) .
            

  Notes  Alternatively, the type  Arity  can be defined
  in a specialization of   CGAL::Arity_traits &lt;&gt;  for the functor.
  This is useful where existing classes cannot be changed easily, e.g.
  the functors from the standard library.
 

  Has Models All functors from the standard library, and all
  functors from the lower dimensional CGAL kernels. For all kernel
  functors, their arity is listed in the documentation. Some (few) of
  them are overloaded with operators of different arities; in this
  case one of these arities has been chosen as default arity. If you
  want to adapt the functor to a different arity, use the functor
  adaptor   CGAL::Set_arity &lt;F,a&gt; .
 

  See Also   CGAL::Arity_tag &lt;int&gt;    CGAL::Arity_traits &lt;F&gt;    CGAL::Set_arity &lt;F,a&gt;    CGAL::set_arity_0     CGAL::set_arity_1     CGAL::set_arity_2     CGAL::set_arity_3     CGAL::set_arity_4     CGAL::set_arity_5
