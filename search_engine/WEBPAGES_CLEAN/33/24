  Data Characteristics 

 
This data set contains weighted census data extracted from the 1994 and 1995   Current Population Surveys  conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The data contains 41 demographic and employment related variables.

  
The instance weight indicates the number of people in the population
that each record represents due to stratified sampling.
To do real analysis and derive conclusions, this field must be used.
This attribute should *not* be used in the classifiers.

  
More information detailing the meaning of the attributes can be found in the Census Bureau's 
  documentation 
To make use of the data descriptions at this site, the following mappings
to the Census Bureau's internal database column names will be needed:

Note that Incomes have been binned at the $50K level to present a binary classification problem, 
much like the original UCI/ADULT database.  The goal field of this data, however,
was drawn from the "total person income" field rather than the
"adjusted gross income" and may, therefore, behave differently than the
orginal ADULT goal field.

   Basic statistics for this data set 

 
Number of instances in data = 199523
   Duplicate or conflicting instances : 46716
Number of instances in test = 99762
   Duplicate or conflicting instances : 20936
Number of attributes = 40 (continuous : 7 nominal : 33)
 






 Data Format 

  One instance per line with comma delimited fields. There are 199523 instances in the data file and 99762 in the test file.

  
The data was split into train/test in approximately 2/3, 1/3
proportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc.
