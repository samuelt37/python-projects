" Automating Process Discovery through Event-Data Analysis " ,

Engineering (ICSE17) , pages 73-82, Seattle, WA, April 1995.

  Abstract  

Many software process methods and tools presuppose the existence of a formal
model of a process.  Unfortunately, developing a formal model for an on-going,
complex process can be difficult, costly, and error prone.  This presents a
practical barrier to the adoption of process technologies.  The barrier would
be lowered by automating the creation of formal models.  We are currently
exploring techniques that can use basic event data captured from an on-going
process to generate a formal model of process behavior.  We term this kind of
data analysis "process discovery".  This paper describes and illustrates
three methods with which we have been experimenting: algorithmic grammar
inference, Markov models, and neural networks.
