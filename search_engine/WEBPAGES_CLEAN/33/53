        New Mini-Bucket Partitioning Heuristics for Bounding the Probability of Evidence    
        Emma Rollon and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
		Mini-Bucket Elimination (MBE) is a well-known approximation
algorithm deriving lower and upper bounds on quantities
of interest over graphical models. It relies on a procedure
that partitions a set of functions, called bucket, into smaller
subsets, called mini-buckets. The method has been used with
a single partitioning heuristic throughout, so the impact of
the partitioning algorithm on the quality of the generated
bound has never been investigated. This paper addresses this
issue by presenting a framework within which partitioning
strategies can be described, analyzed and compared. We derive
a new class of partitioning heuristics from first-principles
geared for likelihood queries, demonstrate their impact on a
number of benchmarks for probabilistic reasoning and show
that the results are competitive (often superior) to state-ofthe-
art bounding schemes.
