oeisstream()
oeisstream(      char        *buffer, unsigned int len, bool copy = true)
oeisstream(const char        *buffer, unsigned int len, bool copy = true)
oeisstream(const std::string &amp;buffer)
oeisstream(const oeisstream  &amp;rhs)
    
Creates a new oeisstream. Passing any of the specified parameters to the
one of the non-default constructors is equivalent to creating a new oeisstream
with the default constructor and then calling the appropriate  set 
method on that stream.

  
If the copy constructor is used, the newly created oeisstream will read from
the same data string as the stream being copied from. If the  copy 
parameter was set to true on the stream being copied from, the new stream will
create its own local copy to read from, otherwise it will just point to the
same place in memory as the original stream. In addition, the newly constructed
stream's reading pointer will be set to the same location as the one in the
stream being copied from.

  
Regardless of whether or not a local copy is made, the stream takes no
responsibility for the management of the original input source's memory.
