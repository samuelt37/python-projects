An Experimental Comparison of Force-Directed and Randomized Graph Drawing Algorithms
 
 
Authors: Franz J. Brandenburg, Michael Himsolt and Christoph Rohrer
 

 
The authors report on experiments with fivegraph drawing algorithms 
for general undirected graphs. These are the algorithms FR introduced 
by Fruchterman and Reingold , KK by Kamada and Kawai , DH by Davidson 
and Harel , Tu by Tunkelang  and GEM by Frick, Ludwig and Mehldau. 
They tested these algorithms on a wide collection of examples and 
with different settings of parameters.  
Examples are from original papers and by their own.
