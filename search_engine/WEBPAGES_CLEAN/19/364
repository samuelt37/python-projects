 Unifying Tree-Decomposition Schemes
for Automated Reasoning

 Abstract  
The paper provides a unifying perspective
of tree-decomposition algorithms appearing in
various automated reasoning areas, such as
join-tree clustering for constraint-satisfaction
and the clique-tree algorithm for probabilistic 
reasoning. Subsequently, the paper extends 
the variable-elimination scheme called
bucket-elimination (BE) into a two-phase message passing 
along a bucket-tree (BTE), making 
it another instance of tree-decomposition.
Our analysis shows that the new algorithm
BTE may provide a substantial speed-up over
BE for important reasoning tasks. Time-space
tradeoffs are cast within the tree-decomposition framework.
