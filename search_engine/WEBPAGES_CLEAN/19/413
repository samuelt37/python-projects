     An Anytime Approximation for Optimizing Policies Under Uncertainty 
 Rina Dechter ( dechter@ics.uci.edu ) 
 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a scheme for approximation 
for the task of maximizing the expected utility 
over a set of policies, that is, a set of possible 
ways of reacting to observations about an un�certain
state of the world. The scheme which 
is based on the mini�bucket idea for approximating 
variable elimination algorithms, is parameterized,
allowing a flexible control between 
efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, since the 
scheme outputs a bound on its accuracy, it 
allows an anytime scheme that can terminate 
once a desired level of accuracy is achieved. 
The presented scheme should be viewed as a 
guiding framework for approximation that can 
be improved in a variety of ways.
