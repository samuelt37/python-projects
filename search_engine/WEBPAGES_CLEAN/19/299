     On the Complexity of Interval-Based Constraint Networks 
 Rony Shapiro, Yishai A. Feldman, and Rina Dechter ( dechter@ics.uci.edu ) 
      
  
 Abstract  
Acyclic constraint satisfaction problems with arithmetic constraints
and domains consisting of sets of disjoint intervals have exponential
complexity, since disjunctions of intervals may be introduced while
propagating through the constraints. This has prompted many researchers 
to use approximations on the bounds of sets of intervals,
resulting in sound, but incomplete, algorithms.
We delineate the complexity of propagation of sets of intervals through
arithmetic constraints. For many types of constraint networks, our analysis 
shows linear, rather than exponential, complexity bounds. Furthermore, 
exponential complexity is a worst-case scenario that is surprisingly 
hard to achieve. In some cases, the number of disjoint intervals in
the output of an acyclic constraint satisfaction problem is independent
of the number of disjoint intervals in the input.
Some empirical results are presented, showing that the worst-case
bound is not achieved for random intervals.
