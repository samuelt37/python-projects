  PlanarMapDcel_2  
 

A model for the   PlanarMapDcel_2   concept defines the underlying
   combinatorial data structure (halfedge data structure) used in the
   planar map data structure   Planar_map_2 &lt;Dcel,Traits&gt; .
  

The
  PlanarMapDcel_2  
concept is a refinement of the   TopologicalMapDcel  . Hence, the requirements for the latter are requirements for the former. 
The difference in requirements is that the  


 Vertex  and  Halfedge 


types should be models of the more refined concepts 
  PlanarMapDcelVertex_2   and   PlanarMapDcelHalfedge_2  .
  

  Types 
           
          PlanarMapDcel_2 ::Vertex
         
              
    The vertex type. Should be a model of the
         PlanarMapDcelVertex_2   concept.
 

          
          PlanarMapDcel_2 ::Halfedge
         
              
    The halfedge type. Should be a model of the
         PlanarMapDcelHalfedge_2   concept.
 

     

The concept   ArrangementDcel_2   is  not  (!) a refinement
   of   PlanarMapDcel_2  . Using a model of the   ArrangementDcel_2   such as
    CGAL::Arr_2_default_dcel&lt;Traits&gt;  will result in an error.
