    Example: Watching TV  From �Learn Java Now�, Stephen R. Davis, Microsoft Press    A TV is a physical object  A TV is a well-defined concept with well-defined boundaries  The concept of TV is universally understood    A TV remote control provides user interface  No other interface is needed  No additional knowledge of TV internals is needed    A TV �works� right out of the box  Robust, fully operational, not expected to fail  Its relations/ attachments to the world are fully documented
