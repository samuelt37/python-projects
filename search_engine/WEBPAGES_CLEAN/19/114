    My research interests are spatial data management for large scale geographical
    data for different applications like intelligent and low cost
    transportation planning, multimedia transcoding and adaptations for end
    user requirements and  � solutions for scalability
    in large scale meta-simulations.     
           
       �   PROJECTS:     
       1.      
          MetaSIM :    It is one of the test-beds
    developed for the Rescue project for the purpose of evaluating the
    different products developed for disaster response. This platform allows
    multiple simulators to collaborate and simulate a larger activity. My
    specific interests in this project is in the scalability aspect of the
    meta-simulation, and I am working on solutions for effective planning and
    simulation on large number of geographies on which the meta-simulation
    activity occurs.    
        2.     
           DrillSim :    This simulator which
    operated on the MetaSIM platform has been developed as part of  Rescue  and  Responsphere  for the purpose of
    testing IT solutions in the context of a crisis response. It is a
    multi-agent simulator for simulating campus level crisis response
    activities on a micro-level. It is a plug and play system where models and
    IT solutions can be added.       
        3.     
           GURU :    It is a   distance learning environment
    that provides a customized learning environment for users with
    disabilities developed as a part of the  SUGA  Project. GURU is developed
    using the MPEG-4 framework and it customizes multimedia information for
    users with visual, auditory and motor impairments.
