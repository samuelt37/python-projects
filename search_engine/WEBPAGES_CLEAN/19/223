It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.
