 AOLserver "webstore" 
   
current version of resource in filesystem   
meta-data, indices, etc. in database
  
DBMS not required; "stackable" with other servers    
 HTML source 
   
With server-side includes and other dynamic content, how does one request the "original" page? 
(Accept: text/x-html-ssi ?)
  
How much canonicalizing should an authoring tool attempt?  (more palatable when pretty-printed, line-break conventions preserved)    
 Rewriting relative links... 
   
duck the issue - do nothing
  
duck the issue - use collections
  
user-specified (state space?)
  
template specified
   
 Rewriting relative links... 
   
user-specified: by type
  
convert { none, relative links, all }
  
convert relative to absolute
    
template-specified: for &lt;APPLET&gt; specifies which &lt;PARAM&gt;s can be rewritten (as above)    
 Lost Update 
   
do nothing (ostriching)
  
detect lost updates (versioning)
  
prevent lost updates\tab (locking)
  
fairness issues (leasing)
   
 Lost Update - versioning 
   
reads include "Content-Version:" headers   
writes provide "Derived-From:" headers
  
server prevents dirty writes
  
solves the "CREATE" problem
  
header syntax has changed for HTTP/1.1
   
 Lost Update - locking 
   
LOCK/UNLOCK methods
  
"Locked-By:" header
  
use OPTIONS to detect server support
  
runs on top of Content-Version scheme
  
fair UNLOCK? collaborative groups hopefully share trust!    
 Access Control 
   
users / groups (multiple membership)
  
METHOD URL (specific/inherited)
  
machine address (netmask)
   
 Access Control List 
   
METHOD+aliases URL (+inheritance)
  
allow/deny (user0 user1 ... userN)
  
allow/deny (group0 group1 ... groupN)
  
allow + deny (netmask0 netmask1 ... netmaskN)    
 Versions 
   
resource revisions are timestamped and saved   
accessed through prefixed URL, therefore   
relative links, images, resolved as of that revision's timestamp   
absolute links? version != snapshot?
   
 PUT vs. POST to publish 
   
PUT method simplifies access control
  
PUT method simplifies infrastructure  caching proxies, gateways, etc...
  
general-use servers starting to support PUT    
 namespace methods 
   
DELETE
  
MKDIR
  
BROWSE
   
 BROWSE sample 
  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
MIME-Version: 1.0

 URL mapping  
magic URLs used for:  
http://server/NS/operation/path... (or form data)    
page permissions
  
page versions
  
administer server
  
PrimeHost Advanced Control Panel
  
use methods instead?
   
 PrimeHost Control Panel  
linked to server administration page, provides    
log analysis, log rolling
  
MIME type configuration
  
FTP reporting, configuration
  
email configuration: aliases/mailing lists    
transparent extension!
  
 Server API's 
   
should we standardize?
  
can "stack" servers for some functionality   
ISAPI is a possibility
   
 Editing variants 
   
editable variants have their own URLs
  
does this apply to versioning, as well?
  
assigning variants to resources similar to access control    
 PICS, etc... 
   
data-driven support for metadata systems (such as PICs rating)   raters provide form-driven well-known URLs to produce their encoding?   
old NaviPress "Describe" functionality  (forms-based association of metadata with resource)    
 miscellanea 
   
cross-server searching (WAIS, MARC, ...)   
cross-vendor AutoLinking?
  
better support for link checking (spec'd, just needs to be implemented?)
