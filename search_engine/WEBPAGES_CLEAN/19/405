 Data was published in :   Hong, Z.Q. and Yang, J.Y. "Optimal Discriminant Plane for a Small Number of Samples and Design Method of Classifier on the Plane", Pattern Recognition, Vol. 24, No. 4, pp. 317-324, 1991.  Donor:   Stefan Aeberhard,  stefan  '@'  coral.cs.jcu.edu.au   

   Data Set Information:  
 This data was used by Hong and Young to illustrate the power of the optimal discriminant plane even in ill-posed settings. Applying the KNN method in the resulting plane gave 77% accuracy. However, these results are strongly biased (See Aeberhard's second ref. above, or email to  stefan  '@'  coral.cs.jcu.edu.au ). Results obtained by Aeberhard et al. are :  RDA : 62.5%, KNN 53.1%, Opt. Disc. Plane 59.4%  The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers. The Authors give no information on the individual variables nor on where the data was originally used.  Notes: -  In the original data 4 values for the fifth attribute were -1. These values have been changed to ? (unknown). (*) -  In the original data 1 value for the 39 attribute was 4.  This value has been changed to ? (unknown). (*) 

   Attribute Information:  
 Attribute 1 is the class label.  All predictive attributes are nominal, taking on integer values 0-3
