It is about how to relax empty-answer SQL queries in RDBMS in order to compute answers for users with a minimal relaxation. We use skyline as our relaxation framework, in which we need to consider join conditions as well. The work extends our previous work on supporting approximate query answering in applications such as data cleaning. See our two VLDB’2005 papers on similar topics. 
 (5/2006)  CleanDB Workshop : I am currently organizing the  CleanDB Workshop  with  Dongwon Lee . It will be colocated with  VLDB2006  in Seoul, Korea.
