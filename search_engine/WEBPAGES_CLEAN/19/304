       The People Behind the Rafts 
       The project group is composed of students and faculty at the  University of California, Irvine .  It is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between  Bill Tomlinson ,  Lynn Carpenter , and their students. 
 The interaction platform for EcoRaft grew out of Professor Tomlinson's  Virtual Raft Project , which involved transporting humanoid characters between virtual islands. 
 Professor Carpenter studies tropical ecology in tropical rainforests, particularly behavior of nectar-feeding birds, and she helped develop the field of restoration ecology.
