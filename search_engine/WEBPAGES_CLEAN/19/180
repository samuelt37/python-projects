          About the Program  
          
          
       
        The goal of the Lead Campus program on Research and Education in Green Materials is to transform the research education of a new cadre of graduate students trained to approach materials science, toxicology, environmental engineering and technologies, and the social sciences through selective engagement in interdisciplinary collaboration. The State of California, through the activities of the UC TSR&amp;TP is committed to be a world leader in understanding these complex issues, and in producing innovative solutions that account for the various perspectives and trends at the local, national, and international levels.
