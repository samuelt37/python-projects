 Simplification 
 
  ICS-31: Introduction to Programming
 
 
  




        Introduction  
 
In this lecture, we will discuss a variety of general issues in program
  simplification.
It introduces no new Python programming features, but instead steps back to
  provide a perspective on one very important programming skill that all
  competent programmers must acquire.
Sometimes simplifying a program is the only way to comprehend it, and hence
  debug it.
Finally, this lecture shows that programs themselves can be studied and
  manipulated in a formal way (just as expressions are manipulated in algebra).
 
           Simplification  
 
We can use the laws of algebra to tell whether two forms are equivalent: using
  either one produces the same result.
Thus, equivalence is a mathematical topic.
But as programmers, we must judge which form (the simpler one) to use in our
  programs.
 
The simplest program is the one that is easiest to read, debug, and maintain.
Thus, simplicity is a psychological topic.
As a rule of thumb, smaller forms are often easier to understand (although
   sometimes a bit ofredundancy makes forms easier to understand:
   smtms lss s nt mr).
  
In this section we will examine three kinds of algebras for proving equivalences
   Boolean Algebra
    Relational Algebra
    Control Structure Algebra
  
We will learn how to prove equivalences in each algebra and discuss how to
  gauge simplicity, as well as show lots of examples of simplifictions.
 
           Boolean Algebra  
 
Boolean Algebra concerns equivalences involving the  bool  type and the
   logical operators.
The following is a list of useful laws (theorems, if you will) of Boolean
  Algebra.
The most practical law is DeMorgan's law: one form explains how to simplify the
  negation of a conjunction ( and ) and the other form explains how to
  simplify the negaion of a disjunction ( or ).
 
     
     &amp;nbsp 
 
We can easily prove laws in Boolean Algebra by trying every combination of
  the  True  and  False  values for each of the variables.
For example, to prove the conjunctive version of DeMorgan's law, we can start
with the following table of values, called a  truth table .
Here we list all the variables in the leftmost columns, and the two
  expressions -which we hope to prove equivalent- in the rightmost columns.
 
     A  B  not(A and B)  not A or not B 
     True  True  &amp;nbsp  &amp;nbsp 
   True  False  &amp;nbsp  &amp;nbsp 
   False  True  &amp;nbsp  &amp;nbsp 
   False  False  &amp;nbsp  &amp;nbsp 

    
We then fill in each column by just computing the values of the expressions
  (using the semantics of the operators and our knowledge of evaluating
   expressions: e.g., operator precedence and associativity).
  
     A  B  not(A and B)  not A or not B 
     True  True  False  False 
   True  False  True  True 
   False  True  True  True 
   False  False  True  True 

    
The law is proved if the columns under the two expressions always contain the
  same pair of values on each line.
This means that for every pair of operands, the expressions compute the same
  result, so the expression are equivalent and thus interchangable in our code.
  
This approach also illustrates a divide and conquer strategy to proofs: we
  divide the complicated proof into four different parts (each a line in the
  truth table); each line is easy to verify by pure calculation; once we verify
  all of the lines, we have verified the entire proof.
  
           Relational Algebra  
 
Relational Algebra concerns equivalances mostly involving the  int  and
   float  types and the numeric and relational operators.
It is based on the law of trichotomy. 
   The law of trichotomy : Given two values, the first is either less
            than, equal to,or greater than the second.
         One (and exactly one) of these relationships must always hold.
  
We can use the law of trichotomy as a divide and conquer method to break one
  hard proof into many simpler ones.
Unlike using boolean values, there are an infinite number of different
    int  values (even though the truth is the amount of memory on a 
   computer is finite, so we can store at most a finite number of digits in any
    int  object).
 
As a first example, we will prove that  max(x,y)+1  is equivalent to
   max(x+1,y+1) .
So, we can factor additive constants out of calls to the  max  function.
  
     x?y  max(x,y)+1  max(x+1,y+1) 
     x   y+1  y+1 
   x = y  x+1 or y+1  x+1 or y+1 
   x &gt; y  x+1  x+1 

    
Here, knowing the relationship between  x  and  y  allows us to
  compute the answer for each expression.
For example, if we know that  x&amp;lty , we know  max(x,y)  evaluates to
    y , so  max(x,y)+1  evaluates to  y+1 ; likewise, if we know
   that  x&amp;lty , we know that  x+1&amp;lty+1 , so  max(x+1,y+1) 
   evaluates to  y+1 .
The other two cases can be simplified similarly. 
  
Again, the law is proved if the columns under the two expressions always have
  the same pair of values on each line.
This means that for every pair of values, the expressions compute the same
  result, so the expressions are interchangable.
  
As another example, we can prove that the expression  x is
  equivalent to   (x=0 and y&gt;=0) , which is True when
   x  and  y  have the same sign (assuming the sign of 0 is
  considered positive).
Here we need to list all possibilities of how  x  and  y 
  compare to  0 .
   
     x?0  y?0  x  (x=0 and y&gt;=0) 
     x  y  True  True 
   x  y=0  False  False 
   x  y&gt;0  False  False 
   x=0  y  False  False 
   x=0  y=0  True  True 
   x=0  y&gt;0  True  True 
   x&gt;0  y  False  False 
   x&gt;0  y=0  True  True 
   x&gt;0  y&gt;0  True  True 

    
So again, the equivalence it proven.
Here is an interesting case where the smaller/simpler/more efficient code is
  not necessarily easier to understand.
Most students believe the larger expression is easier to understand, until
  they intensely study the meaning of  ==  when applied to
   boolean  values generated by relational operators.
  
In actual code, I would suggest using the simpler form, and then include
  the larger -easier to understand- form in a comment; we could even include
  the above proof as part of the comment.
  
Finally we can use the law of trichotomy to prove that we simplify the 
  negation of relational operators.
Be careful when you do so, and recall the law of trichotomy.
If it is not true that x is less than y, then there are two possiblities
  left: x is equal to y or x is greater than y.
Beginning programmers make the mistake of negating  x&lt;y  as
 x&gt;y , but the correct equivalent expression is  x&gt;=y 
  
     x?y  not (x   x &gt;= y 
     x   False  False 
   x = y  True  True 
   x &gt; y  True  True 

    
In fact, we can use the same kinds of proofs to show how to simplify the
  negation of every relational operator.
  
     Negated Form  Simplified Form   
      not (x   x &gt;= y  not (x 
    not (x   x &gt; y  y 
    not (x == y)  x != y  x 
    not (x != y)  x == y  not (x 
    not (x &gt;= y)  x   x 
    not (x &gt; y)  x   not (y 
 
    
Also notice that each of the relational operators is equivalent to an
  expression that includes only the  &amp;lt  relational operator (along
  with sone logical operators).
Although we don't need the five other relational operators to write Python
   programs (in a mathematical sense), they are provided because most
   programmers are aware of them and can use them to write simpler programs
   (in a psychological sense).
Thus the Python language is made larger (more operators) to make it easier for
   human minds to use.
Such value judgements (which is better, a smaller language or a language
easier for humans to use) are required by programming language designers.
  
Finally, we can often simplify negatated relational operators in DeMorgan's
  Laws simplifications.
For example, we can "simplify"  not (x  10)  to
   not (x  10)  which is actually a bit larger, but
  can be further simplified to  x &gt;= 0 and y  which is truly 
  simpler.  
   
           Control Structure Algebra  
 
Now we will explore the richest algebra: the algebra of control structures.
First we will examine when changing the order in a sequence of statements
  doesn't change the results of executing the sequence.
Second we will discuss transformations to  if  statements.
Finally, we will discuss transformations to  while  loops containing
   break  statements.

 
 Sequence equivalences 
We start by examining the orderings of statements and defining two important
  terms.
  A statement  rebind  a name if the name is rebound to an object.
      So, in  x = y  rebinds  b  (but not  y )).
    A statement  evaluates  a name if the statement needs to retrieve
        the value bound to that name.
      So,  x = y  evalutes  y  (but not  x ).
  
Interestingly enough, the expression statement  x += 1  both binds and
  evaluates  x : it first finds the value stored in  x , then
  computes the value one higher, then rebinds  x  to that new value
  (the equivalent assignment statement  x = x+1  illustrates this
  assertion more clearly).
In the entire  if  statement   
  if x &gt; y:            #Evaluates x and y
      z = x            #Rebinds z; evaluates x
  else:
      y++              #Rebinds and evaluates y  
we say that the  if  statement rebinds  z  and  y ; it evaluates
   x  and  y .
This accounts for everything the  if  statement might do when exeucted
  (even though, for example, sometimes it rebinds only  x  and sometimes
   only  y : it depends on the result of the test).
Note that we will also say  print("...")  rebinds into the console
  because this function causes new information to appear inside the console
  window (changing its state); this is a bit of a stretch.
 
Armed with this terminology, we can define  indepdendent  statements in a
  sequence.
Two statements are independent if we can exchange their order and they still
  always compute equivalent results.
Two statements  S 1   and  S 2   are independent if
   S 1   rebinds and evaluates no names that  S 2  
  rebinds, and  S 2   rebinds and evaluates no names that
   S 1   rebinds.
Or, more simply two statements are independent (and we can reverse their order)
  if neither rebinds a name the other rebinds or evaluates.
  
For example, we can exchange the order of
    x = 1
  print(y)  
because these statements satisfy the property above (also, just think about
  whether either statement affects the other: they don't).
We cannot exchange the order of
    x = 1
  print(x)  
because the second statement evaluates   x , which the first statement
  rebinds (the value printed depends on whether  x  is assigned the value
  1 before or after the call of  print ).
Likewise, we can exchange the order of
    x = 1
  y = 0  
because they satisfy the property above.
We cannot exchange the order of 
    x = 1
  x += 1  
because the second statement rebinds  x , which the first statement also
 rebinds.
  
Obviously, changing the order of two statements doesn't simplify anything; but
  we will learn that such exchanges can sometimes enable further "real"
  simplifications.
  


 
 if equivalences 
Now, onto  if  statements.
We can use a modified truth table to prove the equivalence of two  if 
  statements.
For the  if  statement below
    if test:
      statement 1 
  else:
      statement 2   
we have the following modified truth table. 
Note that although  test  can be an arbitrarily complicated expression,
  ultimately its value is either  True  or  False .
 
        test  Code Executed 
     True  statement 1  
   False  statement 2  

    
 Boolean Assignment :
Let's examine various pairs of statements that we can prove equivalent by
  using these modified truth tables.
The first involves storing a  bool  value into a name.
For the two statements     if test:                   b = test
      b = True
  else:
      b = False  
we have the following modified truth table. 
  
     test  Left Code Executed  Right Code Executed 
     True  b = True  b = True(becaue  test  is  True ) 
   False  b = False  b = False (becaue  test  is  False ) 

    
Again, because both columns show the same statements executed, regardless of
  the value of  test , the  if/else  statement on the left and
  expression statement on the right are equivalent.
  
  Test Reversal :
This equivalence shows that we can negate the  test  AND the order of
  the two statements inside the  if/else  and the resulting  if/else 
  statement is equivalent to the first.
    if test:           if not(test):
      statement 1          statement 2 
  else:              else:
      statement 2          statement 1   
we have the following modified truth table. 
  
     test  Left Code Executed  Right Code Executed 
     True  statement 1   statement 1  
   False  statement 2   statement 2  

    
Which means that the following two  if/else  statements are equivalent.
I'd argue that the one on the right is simpler and easier to understand,
  because it is easier to see that it is an  if/else  statement: our
  eyes can see that loking just at the top three lines.
In the version on the left, the small  else  clause is almost hidden
  at the bottom.
  
  if test              if not(test)
      statement T1           statement F 
      statement T2       else:
      ... &amp;nbsp                  statement T1 
      statement Tn           statement T2 
  else:                    ...
      statement F            statement Tn   
Of course, we might be able to use DeMorgan's law to further simplify
    not(test)  too.
  
 Bottom Factoring :
This equivalence shows that we can  always  remove (factor) a common
  statement out from the bottom  of an  if/else  statement.
It is similar to algebraically factoring  AX+BX  into  (A+B)X .
  
  if test:             if test
      statement 1            statement 1 
      statement c        else:
  else:                    statement 2 
      statement 2        statement c 
      statement c   
To prove this equivalence we use the following modified truth table. 
  
     test  Left Code Executed  Right Code Executed 
     True  statement 1  statement c   statement 1  statement c  
   False  statement 2  statement c   statement 2  statement c  

    
For example, the code on the top is equivalent to the code on the bottom.
      if zcc == 0:
      print('zcc = 0')
      zcc = 1
  else:
      print('zcc != 0')
      zcc = 1;

  if zcc == 0:
      print('zcc = 0')
  else:
      print('zcc != 0')
  zcc = 1  
  

 Top Factoring :
This equivalence is shows that we can  often  remove a common statement 
  out from the front of an  if/else  statement.
It is similar to algebraically factoring  XA+XB  into  X(A+B) .
    
  if test:             statement c 
      statement c        if test:
      statement 1            statement 1 
  else:                else:
      statement c            statement 2 
      statement 2   
To prove this equivalence we use the following modified truth table. 
   
     test  Left Code Executed  Right Code Executed 
     True  statement c  statement 1   statement c  statement 1  
   False  statement c  statement 2   statement c  statement 2  

    
But there is one more detail to take care of.
Now we are executing  statement c   before the  if/else ,
  which means it is executed before the  test  expression is evaluated. 
This is guaranteed to work only if the statement and test are independent (as
  defined earlier).
Because a  test  only evaluates names, we can simplify this to
   statement c   must not redefine a name evaluated in
   test 
In the example below, the code on the top is NOT equivalent to the code on the
  bottom.
    if zcc == 0:
      zcc = 1
      print('zcc = 0')
  else:
      zcc = 1
      print('zcc != 0')
  }


  zcc = 1
  if zcc == 0:
      print('zcc = 0')
  else
      print('zcc != 0')  
because the code on the bottom can never have the test  zcc == 0 
  evalute to True.
This is because the  test  ( zcc == 0 ) is not independent of the
  statement   zcc = ; : it evaluates a name redefined by this statement.
  
On the other hand, sometimes even if the expression and statement are not
  independent, we can modify the test to account for the statement always
  executing before the  if/else  statement.
The code on the top here is equivalent to the code on the bottom (we can prove
  it using the law of trichotomy:  zcc ? 0 ).
      if zcc == 0:
      zcc += 1
      print('zcc was == 0')
  else:
      zcc += 1
      print('zcc was not == 0')


  zcc++
  if zcc == 1:
      print('zcc was == 0')
  else
      print('zcc was not == 0')  
In fact, another way to simplify this code is to exchange the two statements in
  each block (they are independent) and then just bottom-factor  zcc += 1 ,
  yielding
    if zcc == 0:
      print('zcc was == 0')
  else:
      print('zcc was not == 0')
  zcc += 1  

  
 

 
 loop equivalences 
Finally, let's look at three loop equivalences.
 
 else Removal :
This equivalence involves the removal of an unnecessary  else  in an
   if  controlling a  break .
    while True:              while True:
      statements 1               statements 1 
      if test:                 if test:
          break                    break
      else:                    statements 2 
          statements 2   
In both loops, if  test  is  True  Python executes the  break ;
  if  test  is  False  each loop executes
   statements 2   next and
  then re-executes the loop: on the left because  statements 2  
  is in the  else , and on the right 
  because the  if  finishes and Python executes the next statement in the
  loop's body.
  After executing  statements 2  , the bodies of both loops are
  finished executing, so the loop causes Python to execute them again.
  
Typically code is simpler if it isn't nested deeply.
  
 Loop Factoring :
  The second loop equivalence again involves factoring statements.
    
  while True:             while True:
      statements 1              statements 1 
      if test:                if (test)
          statements a               break
          break               statements 2 
      statements 2          statements a   
In both loops, if  test  is  False  each executes
   statements 2  , and the bodies of both loops are executed
  again.
In the left loop, if  test  is  True  it executes
   statements a   and then terminates the loop; on the right it
  terminates the loop and afterward executes   statements a  .
The order of these operations makes no difference.
  
Typically, loop statements are the most complex to understand, in terms of
  what they do; so by removing  statements a   from the body
  of the loop, we simplify it.
  
 Loop Rerolling :    
The third loop equivalence involves moving statements repeated before and at
  the bottom of a loop completely inside the loop.
    
  statements 1              while True:
  while True:                 statements 1 
      if test:                if test:
          break                   break
      statements 2              statements 2 
      statements 1   
Each code fragment first executes  statements 1   (on the left
  before the loop; on the right as the first statement in the loop's body).
Then, each tests for termination; if the  test  is not True, each executes
   statements 2  , followed by  statements 1   (on
  the left at the  bottom of the loop; on the right at the top of th loop),
  followed by testing for termination again.
  
Typically, we want to avoid duplicating statements inside and outside of
  loops.
By using  while / if / break , which allows a termination test
  in the middle of a loop, we can remove this redundancy.
    
    
           Pragmatics  
 
The formal techniques presented and illustrated above allow us to prove that
  two programming forms are equivalent.
It is then up to us to determine which form is simpler, and use it in our
  programs.
As a rule of thumb, the smaller the code the simpler it is.
Also, code with fewer nested statements is generally simpler.
 
More generally, we should try to distribute complexity.
So, when decidiing between two equivalences, choose the one whose most
  complicated statement is simplest.
  
If you ever find yourself duplicating code, there is an excellent chance that
  some simplification will remove this redundancy.
Beginners are especially prone to duplicating large chunks of code, missing the
  important simplification.
  
We should aggressively simplify our code while we are programming.
We will be amply rewarded, because it is easier to add more code (completing
  the phases of the enhancements) to an already simplified program.
If we wait until the program is finished before simplifying...well, we many
  never finish the program because it has become too complex; if we do
  finish, the  context in which to perform each simplification will be much
  bigger and more complex, making it harder to simplify.
Excessive complexity is one of the biggest problems that a software engineer
  faces.
  
Generally, I try not to get distracted when I am writing code; but one of 
  the few times that I will stop writing code is when I see a simplification.
I know that in the long run, taking time to do a simplification immediately
  will likely allow me to finish the  program faster.
  
           Problem Set  
 
To ensure that you understand all the material in this lecture, please solve
  the the announced problems after you read the lecture.
 
If you get stumped on any problem, go back and read the relevant part of the
   lecture.
If you still have questions, please get help from the Instructor, a TA, or any
  other student.

   Prove that the expressions  x  and  (x  are
         equivalent.
       Prove that the expressions  x  and  (x &gt;= 10) == False 
          are equivalent.
       In each case, which would you judge the simpler expression?
      
     
     Use the law of trichotomy to prove that  (x+y-abs(x-y))//2  and
            min(x,y)  compute the same value.
      
     
     In the following statements, identify which names rebind and which
         are evaluted.
            x += y 
              x = x + 1 
              print(x) 
              if x &gt; 0: x = 0 
              if x == 0: break 
            

     Prove that the following two statements are equivalent.
        declared  boolean b; 
          if test:           b = !test;
      b = False
  else:
      b = True  
   

     The code on the left is not equivalent to the code on the right (which
         has been top factored).
      They are not equivalent because the  if 's test and the statement
          x += 1  are not independent.
      Rewrite the  if 's test in the code on the right so that left and
         right are equivalent.

      How does this question relate to the material in this lecture?

      As a programmer whose code is read by other people (as well as the Python compiler), what
        implications does this have for the audience for which we are writing code?
