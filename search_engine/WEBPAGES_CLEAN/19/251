 Chimera 2.0 Tutorial: Creating a Subweb<body>
 

 Creating a Subweb 

   
You can pass on anchors and links from one web to another by 
creating a subweb.  A subweb is a hyperweb which inherits all 
anchors and links from the web it was created from.  The subweb
is made the child of the original web in the hierarchy or
webs.
 

 The creation of webs is controlled at the 
Chimera Website.  The following example creates a new web below the 
flight_web used in the previous example.  
 


 Creating a Subweb below the flight_web 

  The actions of creating and deleting webs is controlled at the
Chimera Website through the Hyperweb Manager.  To create a subweb 
of flightweb, first click the Hyperwebs tab on the Hyperweb Manager and 
then select the flight_web. Click on the Create Subweb button and 
name the new web flight_heros.
 

   

  Note: The connection between the Chimera Website and the Chimera Server
will be shut down when you create a new subweb.
 

 Connecting to the New Web using the Chimera Server 

  The connection between the Chimera Server and the Chimera Website 
was severed when the new web was created.  Once the web has been 
created you can selected it by doing the following in the Chimera Server:
 

   Reconnect to the Chimera Website by selecting it from the 
	Server tab and clicking the Login button. 
   
	(Note: After the Login is pressed the display shifts to the Webs tab.)

       Selected the newly created subweb, flight_heros, from the Webs tab then
	click the Login button to connect to that hyperweb.
   
	 
	Note: The Links tab will appear after the connection to flight_heros is made.
	The Links tab will show the link x1 which was 
	inherited from flight_web.
	 
       Select the inherited x1 link as the active Link.
   

    You are now ready to add a new anchor to this inherited Link.
