Blame Trees

Presenting a paper by

A "blame query" in a version control system associates each line of a
text file
with the person that was the last to modify it. I will present "blame
trees", data structures
that allow for efficient merging of two versions of the same document
with conflicting edits.
The "blame tree" representation allows merging two documents in time
proportional to the sum of logarithms of the sizes of shared regions,
plus the cost of conflict resolution.
