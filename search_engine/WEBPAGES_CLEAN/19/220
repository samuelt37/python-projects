Abstract: 
Given a probability distribution over a set of n words to be
transmitted, the Huffman Coding problem is to find a minimal-cost
prefix 
free code for transmitting those words. The basic Huffman coding
problem 
can be solved in O(n log n) time but variations are more difficult.
One 
of the standard techniques for solving these variations utilizes a 
top-down dynamic programming approach.
In this paper we show that this approach is amenable to dynamic
programming speedup techniques, permitting a speedup of an order of 
magnitude for many algorithms in the literature for such variations
as 
mixed radix, reserved length and one-ended coding. These speedups are
immediate implications of a general structural property that permits
batching together the calculation of many DP entries.
