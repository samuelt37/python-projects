				 About Me 
				 January 03, 2007 by Danny 

				 I received my Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science, with emphasis in Embedded Systems Security and Reliability from the University of California, Irvine. My research supervisor was Professor Nikil Dutt. I am a UCI President�s Dissertation Year Fellow, Intel/GEM Fellow, Federal Cyber Service Fellow and ACM/Student Member from the University of California, Irvine. I am part of the NSF Variability Expeditions effort. I am associated with the Center for Computer Embedded Systems, the Architectures and Compilers for Embedded Systems groups at UCI, and the Leopard/Autonomic Storage Group at IBM Almaden Research Center. I am currently an Assistant Project Scientist at UC-Irvine and plan/hope to join the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR). 
                
                My research interests are embedded system hw/sw co-design, performance modeling, memory management, compiler optimizations, OS/HW virtualization, hardware/software security and reliability, as well as storage systems solutions.  I have two major efforts: 1) The development of variation-aware software stacks with emphasis in efficient memory management for multi- and many-core platforms as well as data centers. 2) The development of hardware support for trusted software execution in embedded multi- and many-core platforms.  

				 I am a former Introduction to Programming I&amp;II (ICS 21, 22) and Introduction to Digital Design Teaching Assistant. I have also lead a seminar on embedded systems security (Spring Quarter 2009/UCI)
