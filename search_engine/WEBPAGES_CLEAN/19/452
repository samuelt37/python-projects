  Benchmark Descriptions 
     The following sets of benchmarks were used in the evaluation:        Linkage1 / WCSP     bn2o     Diagnose     Grids     Linkage 2     Promedas     UAI06-MPE     UAI06-PE     Relational        In the following these sets are characterized in more detail.

    Submitter: UCLA     Domain: Relational Bayesian networks constructed from the Primula tool     Type: Bayes for MAR/PRE     251 networks, with binary variables     150 Blockmap: 700 to 59,404 variables     80 Mastermind: 1,220 to 3,692 variables      11 Friends &amp; Smoker: 10 to 76,212 variables      10 Students: 376 variables       Large networks with large treewidths, but with high levels of determinism       networks ,  list  of networks used for exact PR/MAR, and a  subset  of networks used for the other tasks.                    
  Benchmarks 
     All benchmarks are available for download  here .  Lists of networks used, or subsets of networks used, are also given.  Note that each network was assigned (arbitrarily) an ID, for purposes of the evaluation.       Networks are specified in the evaluation  FileFormat , with accompanying evidence.                 
  Summary tables 
     These tables summarize the benchmark instances used with exact solvers for MAR and PE.        ('Bayes' and 'Markov' show whether the set contains Bayesian or Markov networks, 'Binary' whether the instances have binary variables only.)              Set
