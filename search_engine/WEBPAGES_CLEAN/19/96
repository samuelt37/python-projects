  Adaptive System Interoperability 
 Project sponsored by   Office
of Naval Research (ONR)  
 
as part of the   DoD
Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI)        
The goal of the project is to develop new models of adaptive system
interoperability that provide more flexible models of integration
between components, and support coordination, mobility, scalability and
adaptability to changing conditions.  
Future applications will execute in highly dynamic environments, where
communication is not uniform due to changing conditions of network
connectivity, reliability and resource availability. Designing
communication frameworks that are capable of dynamically adapting
themselves to the environment is an important challenge. Furthermore,
different applications may demand different properties and guarantees
as far as the QoS, security and failure semantics are concerned.
Although several frameworks have been designed to support modular and
reconfigurable communication, they support complex programming
interfaces and their behavior is often expressed via informal
descriptions. Clear semantic models capable of expressing dependencies
among properties required by a given communication system will help
design safe customizable communication frameworks.    Professor (PI)
