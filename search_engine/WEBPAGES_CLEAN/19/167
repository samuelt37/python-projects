               step 1. Research Question and Null-Hypothesis 
              
               Research Question (RQ1):  
               versus 
                Null Hypothesis (H0): 
               equals 
                Alternate Hypothesis (Ha):   
              
             
           
           
             
               step 2. Define Population
