   Optimal Möbius transformations for information visualization

We give linear-time
 quasiconvex programming 
algorithms for finding a Möbius transformation of a
 set of spheres 
in a unit ball or on the
surface of a unit sphere that maximizes the minimum size of a
transformed sphere. We can also use similar methods to maximize the
minimum distance among a set of pairs of input points. We apply these
results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
 graph drawing , viewpoint selection in
 hyperbolic  browsing, and element size
control in conformal structured
 mesh generation .

    Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres . 
D. Eppstein,
 G. Kuperberg ,
and
 G. Ziegler .  arXiv:math.CO/0204007 .  Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday ,
Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.
 
We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Comment on "Location-Scale Depth".  
D. Eppstein.   J. Amer. Stat. Assoc.  99 (468): 976–979, 2004 .
 
Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional  hyperbolic
space .  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.
  
    Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0604034 .  18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(3): Article 29, 2009 .
 
We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.
  
    Succinct greedy geometric routing using hyperbolic geometry .

hyperbolic plane"), 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 14–25.   IEEE Transactions on Computing  60 (11): 1571–1580, 2011 .
 
Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be
isometrically embedded into Cartesian products of five (but not, in
general, fewer than five) trees.
  
    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar Lombardi drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1206.6142 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 126–137 .  
We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

    Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines . 
D. Eppstein,
M. van Garderen,
 B. Speckmann , and
 T. Ueckerdt .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing  (poster), Bordeaux, France, 2013. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.
