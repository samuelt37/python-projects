  Implications: Architectures  
      Architectures to exploit interconnect delays
 
  pipeline interconnect delays [recall Cray-2]
  cycle time = max delay - min delay
    use interconnect delay as the minimum delay
  need P&amp;R estimates early in the design 
       Algorithms that use interconnect latencies
 
  interconnect as functional units
  functional unit schedules are based on a measure of spatial distances
       Increase local decision making
 
  multiple state transitions in a clock period
  storage-controlled routing 
  re-programmable blocks in �custom layouts�
