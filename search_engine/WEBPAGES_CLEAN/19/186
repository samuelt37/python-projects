  Recovering a lost password 
     If you have forgotten your password, enter your email address in the field above and click on the  Mail me my account data</strong> button.       The email you will receive contains the encrypted password (so even if someone intercepts the mail, they won't know the REAL password). To recover your password, enter the encrypted Login Password from the received email into the Password field next time you log in. After successfully logging in, you can then set a new password and save your settings.
