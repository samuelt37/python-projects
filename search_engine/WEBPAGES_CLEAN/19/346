bool SetValenceCorrection(bool)
    
The  SetValenceCorrection  method controls the valence correction
mode setting of an  OELibraryGen  instance.   OELibraryGen 
instances are constructed by default with the valence correction mode
set to false.  Valence correction mode can be turned on by passing a
boolean true value to an  OELibraryGen  instance using this
method.  When valence correction mode is enabled, the
 OELibraryGen  instance will attempt to adjust the
hydrogen count on atoms in the product molecule that are involved in
the reaction to match the original valence state of the reactant.  For
product atoms that do not undergo a nuclear reaction (atomic number is
retained) the hydrogen count is either increased or decreased to match
the initial valence state of the corresponding reactant atom.  Formal
charge is taken into account during the hydrogen count adjustment.
