A  directed graph  is
a set of nodes (or vertices)
and
a set of edges (disjoint from the nodes),
where each edge has an initial node and a terminal node. 
 
 
More formally,
a directed graph is a quadruple
( V ,  E ,  α ,  β ), where
 
    V  is a (possibly infinite) set of nodes,
   
     E  is a set of edges, disjoint from
     V ,
   
     α  and  β  are two mappings from each edge
     e   ∈   E ,
    with  α ( e )  ∈   V 
    the  origin 
    (or  initial vertex ) of  e 
    and   β ( e )   ∈   V 
    the  terminal 
    (or  end vertex ) of  e . 
     α ( e ) and  β ( e )
    are the
     endpoints  of  e . 
   
  
An  undirected graph  is
a set of nodes (or vertices)
and
a set of edges (disjoint from the nodes),
where each edge has two endpoints, not distinguished from each other. 
 
 
More formally,
an undirected graph is a triple
( V, E,   δ ), where
 
    δ  is a mapping from each edge  e   ∈   E 
    to two nodes (not necessarily distinct)
     v1   ∈   V  and
     v2   ∈   V .
     v1  and  v2 
    are the
     endpoints  of  e . 
   
  
Two directed graphs
( V, E,   α ,  β ) and
( V', E',   α ',  β ')
are  isomorphic  if
there are bijections
 g:V→V'  and
 h:E→E' 
such that for each  e  ∈  E ,
 
 
   α '( h ( e ))= g ( α ( e ))
and
   β '( h ( e ))= g ( β ( e ))
 

 
A  loop  is an edge
both whose endpoints are equal. 
 
 
A graph contains  multiple edges 
when two edges share corresponding endpoints. 
If a directed graph has no multiple edges,
then for it  E  ⊆  V × V .
 
 
A graph is  simple  if
it contains neither loops nor multiple edges. 
 

 
Informally, a partial graph is obtained by deleting some edges,
and a subgraph is obtained by deleting some nodes
and any edges that are their endpoints.
 
 
 G '=( V', E',   α ',  β ')
is a  partial graph  of
 G =( V, E,   α ,  β )
if
 
    V' = V ,
   
     E'  ⊆  E ,
    and
   
    ∀e ∈ E' :
   α '( e ) =  α ( e ) and
   β '( e ) =  β ( e )
   
  
 G' 
is a  subgraph  of
 G 
if
 
    V'  ⊆  V ,
   
     E'  = { e  ∈  E  |
     α ( e ) ∈  V'  and
     β ( e ) ∈  V'  },
    and
   
    ∀e ∈ E' :
   α '( e ) =  α ( e ) and
   β '( e ) =  β ( e )
