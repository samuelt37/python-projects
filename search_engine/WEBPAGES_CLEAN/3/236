               Hello! I hope everybody's summer went well. Although I took some ICS courses over the break, my summer was relatively relaxed. Now it's time to get back into 10-week-fall-quarter-pressure mode.  I have added totally new content on this site, so feel free to check it all out. I have especially revamped the  music page , and I have launched  "The Guitar Factory"  for those who would like to improve their guitar skills! Also, there are more essays in my  writing page  and a new section in the  faith page  that outlines how to make  peace with God .  Have a great day and feel free to  send me an email  if you have any comments.
