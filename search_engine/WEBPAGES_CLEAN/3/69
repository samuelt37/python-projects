        Approximate Solution Sampling (and Counting) on AND/OR spaces    
        Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   

            In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for sampling solutions from
		   			a uniform distribution over the solutions of a constraint network. Our new algorithm
		   			improves upon the Sampling/Importance Resampling (SIR) component of
		   			our previous scheme of SampleSearch-SIR by taking advantage of the decomposition
		   			implied by the networkï¿½s AND/OR search space.We also describe how our
		   			new scheme can approximately count and lower bound the number of solutions
		   			of a constraint network. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
		   our new algorithm yields far better performance than competing approaches.
