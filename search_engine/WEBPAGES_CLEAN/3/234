            NBA Playoff Predictions    
        
           
               The  NBA playoffs  are in full swing, and it seems that most series are evenly matched this year -- especially San Antonio vs. Dallas, and Atlanta vs. Miami.   Even the Lakers (1st seed) lost to the 8th seed Jazz tonight, and I bet that series will last 7 games.     A couple of  researchers from Georgia Tech  are predicting that Cleveland will win it all.  They are using a "Logistic Regression / Markov Chain" technique which uses logistic regression to estimate transition probabilities for a Markov chain.   They claim that LRMC has predicted the right winner in the NCAA tournament 3 out of 5 years, which is pretty good, considering that there's not much room for error in March Madness due to the single-elimination format.  In the NBA playoffs, Cleveland, led by Lebron James, seems to be a very safe pick to win it all this year, and so the LRMC technique may be right again.   I see some first-round upsets though.  My best guess:    LA Lakers over Jazz in 7.   Denver over New Orleans in 5.   Dallas over San Antonio in 6.   Houston over Portland in 7.   Cleveland over Detroit in 5.   Boston over Chicago in 5.   Orlando over Philly in 6.    Miami over Atlanta in 7.    One team that's heating up in the postseason is the Dallas Mavericks.  I wouldn't be surprised if they made it to the conference finals.

               Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"  John 11:25-26
