   Welcome To My Homepage.   
       
       
   I am a Ph.D candidate in the      School of Information and Computer Science     ,      University of California Irvine     , working with Prof.      Nalini Venkatasubramanian      in      Information Systems Group      (ISG) group on the Qos-Aware Middleware for Service Allocation in Mobile Cloud Computing project. I am interested in any challenging work in      Mobile Cloud Computing     ,      Social Networks      and      Big Data     .    
   I got outstanding researcher award from      Sharif University Electronic Research Institute      for my B.Sc project on fingerprint high level classification, best student poster and NSF student scholar award from      IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2011      for my Ph.D work on mobile cloud computing, 4-year UCI fellowship for my Ph.D studies (2009-2013), Student Travel Awards of USENIX/ACM OSDI'08, iCORE'08, USENIX LISA'10, USENIX/ACM FAST'10, USENIX/ACM NSDI'11, IEEE WoWMoM'12 and my      Erd      ö      s Number is 4     .   
   During the summer of 2011, I was with      Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto      where I worked on the mobile social networks and the next generation of location based services. I worked at      AT&amp;T Labs Research, Shannon Lab      on cloud-based multi-site video conferencing based on SIP protocol during the summer of 2012.
