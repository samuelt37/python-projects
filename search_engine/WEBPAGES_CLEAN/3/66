Homomorphism polynomials complete for VP
 
 
Umut Isik
 

 
Abstract:
I will discuss the complexity classes VP and VNP of families of polynomials.
While VNP contains complete problems (like the permanent) that are natural,
the class VP was now known to have any complete problems beyond those that
can be based on circuit-related problems based on the definition of VP. I
will discuss a natural VP-complete family based on 'graph homomorphism
polynomials'. 
  
This talk is based on a 
 paper by 
Arnaud Durand, Meena Mahajan, Guillaume
Malod, Nicolas de Rugy-Altherre, and Nitin Saurabh .
