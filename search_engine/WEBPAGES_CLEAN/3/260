3.1.54 SetSymmetryClass 
 
   
virtual bool SetSymmetryClass(unsigned int symclass)
    
Set the symmetry class of an atom.  This routine is normally only
called by the OEChem function  OEPerceiveSymmetry .  The default
value is zero, indicating that the symmetry class hasn't be perceived.
The symmetry class of an atom may be retrieved by using the
 OEAtomBase::OEGetSymmetryClass  function.
