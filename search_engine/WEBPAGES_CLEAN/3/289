 UCI National Clustering Lab Environment<body>

   Founding Charter 
 for 
     ICS Clustering, SAN and  
 Fibre Channel Laboratory 
    
   
   at the Department of Information &amp; Computer Science 
 University of California, Irvine 
   			 
   April 1999 
   
   
   
   
      Clustering, SAN and Fibre Channel Lab 
   
   At the University of California, Irvine (UCI), a group of professors have agreed with the initiative of the chairman of the fibre channel clustering committee to establish a Clustering, SAN and Fibre Channel Laboratory. Housed in UCI�s Department of Information &amp; Computer Science, the Clustering, SAN and Fibre Channel Lab will be sustained through an alliance of academia and industry. 
 UCI�s Department of Information &amp; Computer Science was recently ranked by PC Week as one of our nation�s top 10 programs for technology education. It is the largest computing department in the University of California system, and the third largest of any school in the West. The faculty and students are uniquely qualified to lead new trends in clustering research.  
   
     VISION 
 Foster the concept of a Single System Image at 99.999% availability in a heterogeneous environment. 
   
     GOAL 
 Establish and maintain a national laboratory resource to pursue the Vision.  
   
     THE ALLIANCE 
 The Department of Information &amp; Computer Science at UCI will nurture alliances with organizations involved in Clustering and related technologies such as: 
  Clustering Systems 
 Fibre Channel and Storage Area Network (SAN) 
 Clustering Applications   	 
     RESEARCH THRUSTS 
 Research and technical emphasis of the faculty associated with the lab include: 
   

    Data Management and Data Mining     Support for complex multidimensional datasets, management of highly dynamic data sets, spatio-temporal database management, management of uncertainty in database systems, machine learning and pattern recognition over large data sets, visualization of dynamic data sets. 

    Clustering for Numerical and Scientific Computing     Scalability, memory hierarchy performance, parallel I/O, compilation, application issues, portable libraries including message passing. 

    Distributed Systems      Network centric computing, availability and fault tolerance in distributed and parallel systems, replication and caching in distributed environments, open and heterogeneous systems environments, Quality of Service enabled resource management, composable middleware for distributed systems, concurrent object based computing, ubiquitous and mobile computing environments, security protocols, systems and performance analysis 

    Multimedia Management     Analysis and interpretation of multimedia data, representation and storage of multimedia information, multimedia information retrieval and database management, communication and transmission of multimedia objects, multimedia in mobile environments, quality of service specification and enforcement in multimedia applications 

    Applications      Multimedia search engines, video on demand systems, multimedia teleconferencing, distance learning, multimedia enabled classrooms, web mining, telemedicine, bio-medical diagnostic tools, weather interpretation and advisory systems, tools for visualizing and animating dynamic objects, digital arts and entertainment, electronic commerce

     SPONSOR BENEFITS 

   Product Testing   � Each industry sponsor will be provided with access to the lab for testing of product performance, interoperability and scalability. The average duration for industry usage will be 2 to 4 days. Extended industry testing arrangements may be considered by the board in accordance with university research needs. All testing will be completed by the industry sponsor and it is expected that the lab will be left in its original state for continuation of university research. Sponsors will also have the exclusive option for additional lab usage on a fee-for-service basis. Please note that UCI does not assume legal responsibility for assuring the accuracy of testing completed in the lab. 
  Advisory Board   � The board is comprised of lab faculty and representatives from industry, ensuring that sponsors have direct input into activities and policy decisions. The board meets on a quarterly basis. 
  Technical Reports   - Subscription to all technical reports published by lab faculty and the Information &amp; Computer Science Department. 
  Annual Meeting   � Lab faculty present research findings on an annual basis to share ideas on clustering issues. 
  Visiting Researchers   - Companies have the opportunity to send visiting scholars and have them participate in a faculty member's research group consistent with resource availability. 
  Recruiting   - Lab sponsors will have opportunities to interact with students, as well as, post job announcements in student labs and electronic bulletin boards.        
 LAB OVERVIEW 

   Structure   - The Lab will have an industry advisory board, director, support staff and physical facilities such as space, computing and networking. 
  Funding -   Industry Sponsorship is $25,000 Annually  Sponsor donations are tax deductible gifts that will be used to enhance research programs in the lab as well as maintain the computing infrastructure. Gifts can be made payable to the UCI Foundation and returned to:    		Jennifer Stameson, Director of Development 
 		UCI 
 		444 Computer Science Bldg. 
 		Irvine, CA 92697-3425    No University overhead costs will be charged against sponsor gifts to the lab. In addition to cash contributions, the lab accepts tax deductible gifts of hardware and software that enhance the research efforts.
