 Instruction Set Information<body>

  Instruction Set Information  
      The ADL contains the following information about the instruction-set of the architecture:
 
  Syntax, semantics of each operation
   needed for code-generation, disambiguation etc.
    Instruction template
   needed for VLIW/Superscalar type architectures.
    Operation mappings
   needed for instruction-selection, mutations etc.
    Resources used by each operation
   needed for instruction-scheduling
   can be used to automatically determine constraints on parallelism available  in the architecture.
