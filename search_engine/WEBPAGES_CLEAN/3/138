      ISDL [1]: An Instruction-Set Description Language used to describe target architectures to a retargetable compiler.
 
  Does not contain structural information.
  Constraints on parallelism have to be explicitly mentioned.
  Memory hierarchy is not supported.
  Information needed for �adaptable� optimizations (like mutation) is not present.
       nML [2]: An instruction-set approach to machine description.
 
  Does not explicitly support sub-instructions and multi-cycle instructions.
  Does not contain full structural information.
       MIMOLA [3]: Describes the structural information of the architecture
 
  Very low-level description of structure (net-list)
  Laborious to write and modify.
