    Executive Committee  

The Executive Committee is the decision and policy making body that
guides IRUS and provides direction 
for IRUS's future. The Executive Committee is comprised of IRUS faculty
and representatives from IRUS 
sponsors, ensuring that sponsors have direct input into the development
of new programs, new activities, 
and policy decisions. Committee members choose topics for events such as
technology symposia, and 
themes for new roundtables and technical interchange/networking meeting
series. The Executive Committee meets quarterly.
