ï¿½ via the Web

     Advantages of leveraging the Web for software development:
 
  Geographic distribution: Software development artifacts can be accessed via the network
  Use the browser: Ubiquitous browsers can easily view development artifacts
  Leverage existing infrastructure: Many tools already use the Web
  Builds on open standards: Web standards are open, yielding many suppliers, often open source, for components.  Keeps infrastructure costs low.       --&gt;
