  ICS Student Council recognized for launching Med AppJam</strong> 
 

 Med AppJam Judging and Awards Ceremony 
 
 
The  ICS Student Council  has received a 2013 Anteater Award in the Most Outstanding New Program category for launching the first-ever  Med AppJam . Held last fall, Med AppJam drew 30 medical students and 100 information and computer sciences students who teamed up to create, over just 10 days, iOS-based mobile applications useful to both physicians and patients.
 
 
The annual  Anteater Awards , presented by Student Life &amp; Leadership, recognizes the accomplishments of UCI’s student organizations. 
 
 
“The ICS Student Council is the official student government for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences,” explains Tony Givargis, computer science professor and associate dean for student affairs. “ICSSC organizes a number of fantastic events each year, and the school is tremendously proud of the council’s dedication to improving the academic, social and professional lives of our students.”
