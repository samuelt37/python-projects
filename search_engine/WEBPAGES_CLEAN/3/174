4.84 OEIsCommonIsotope 
 
   
bool OEIsCommonIsotope(unsigned int elemno, unsigned int mass)
    
Determine whether the isotope specified by the atomic number elemno,
and atomic mass mass is a valid combination.  This list is derived
from high-energy physics experiments, and is useful for checking
whether the masses provided on radioisotopes are within the expected
range.
