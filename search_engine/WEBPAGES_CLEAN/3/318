 I was a PhD student at  UC Irvine , where I was advised by professor  Charless Fowlkes  at the  Computer Vision group.  

 My research focused on improving object detection by finding geometric context cues. In particular, I investigated how structure from motion and multi-view stereo can help in the world of scene understanding. 

 Since October 2016, I am an intern at HP Inc., working on the Immersive Technology research group.
