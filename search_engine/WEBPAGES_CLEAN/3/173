 Problem Solving with State-Space Seaching


Introduction: 

In the this lecture as in the previous one, we will look at how to think about
solving certain kinds of problems on computers, by thinking about finding their
solutions as the process of searching through trees. In this lecture we will
look at problem solving using "breadth-first search" and a new variant of
"depth first search" (i.e, not pre-/in-post-order) called "best-first search".
The queue and priority queue collections respectively play major roles in each
of these search orders. They don't use recursion/stacks but do use queues and
priority queues, which can add/remove values from the type, and check whether
a variable of that type is empty.

Again, no tree gets constructed explicitly (no new TN() statements will appear
in any code), but the order in which the nodes are examined can be nicely
visualized as a tree, whose nodes are searched until a solution is found (or
until the code discovers that no solution is possible).


Water Jug Problems:

To be concrete, we will start by describing a schema for Water Jug problems, to
help us learn the right terminology. One example of a Water Jug problem is as
follows.

  We have three jugs (call them j1, j2, and j3) with capacities 3, 5, and 8
  gallons respectively. At the start, j1 and j2 are empty and j3 is filled
  (with 8 gallons). We can pour liquid from one jug into another according to
  the following rules: once we start pouring, we must empty the jug we are
  pouring FROM, except we can never overflow the jug we are pouring INTO (so we
  stop either when the FROM jug is empty or the TO jug is filled, whichever
  comes first). We want to discover a sequence of pouring operations (from
  various jugs into other various jugs, according the pouring rules) such that
  eventually j1 is empty and j2 and j3 each contain 4 gallons.

So, the rules say that if we start pouring from j3 to j1, we must stop when
j1 has 3 gallons (it cannot overflow) so j3 has 5 gallons remaining. If we then
start pouring j1 into j2 we must pour all 3 gallons, so j1 will contain 0
gallons and j2 will contain 3 gallons. If we then start pouring j3 into j2 we
must stop when j2 has 5 gallons (it cannot overflow) so j3 has 3 gallons
remaining.

In this formulation of the Water Jugs problem, water is conserved: we can 
neither pour water onto the ground (removing it from the system) or put water
into a jug from the tap (adding it to the system). In other versions of this
problem we can empty a jug onto the ground or fill a jug from the tap.

Note: Students have been telling me for a few quarters that one of of the Die
Hard movies involved a water jugs problem (2 jugs, 3 and 5, where the solution
requires one jug with 4 gallons; this is a non-conserved problem: the water
jugs are empty and can be filled from a tap and emptied on the ground). Here is
a link to the the video:

General State-Space Search Problems:

Now let's describe this problem as a general state-space search problem.

First, the salient information about the current state of the problem is how
many gallons of water each jug currently holds. We call such a description a
STATE and can think of describing a state simply as a triple of numbers:
(j1,j2,j3). So (2,4,2) represents the state where j1 contains 2 gallons, j2
contains 4 gallons, and j3 contains 2 gallons. 

Besides calling (2,4,2) a state, we can also call it a point in the space of
all possible states. We can think of this space as a subset of points in
3-dimensional space: first, it includes only those points whose coordinates are
integers; second the sum of the values of the coordinates must always be 8
(because water is conserved). Together, these points specify all possible
states for the JUGS and are collectively called the STATE-SPACE of the problem. 

We also specified a START and STOP state (point in state-space): in the
problem above, the start state is (0,0,8) and the stop state is (0,4,4).
Sometimes we want to allow more than one stop state: in such cases we can
either specify them individually as a set, or via a boolean function:
is_stop_state would take a state as a parameter and it returns whether or not
it is a stop state.

Finally, we described OPERATORS that we can apply to any state, each of which
transforms one state into another state (or think of an operator moving us from
one point to another point in the state-space). We saw that the "pour j3 into
j1" operator, when applied to state (0,0,8) transforms it into state (3,0,5).
Likewise, if we applied the "pour j3 into j1" operator to state (2,3,3) it
would transform it to the state (3,3,2), because j1 already holds 2 gallons
and can hold a maximum of 3 gallons, so j3 is reduced by exactly 1 gallon.

Generally, a solution to a state-space search problem is a sequence of
operators that transforms the start state into the stop state by applying
one operator at a time, hopping from state to state (point to point in
state-space) in the order specified by the sequence. We would like to find
the shortest solution (measured by number of operators) and we would like to
find that solution quickly (examining few operators not on the solution path).


Solving a State-Space problem as Tree Searching:

We will label every node in a tree with some state, and label every edge from a
parent to a child with an operator that transforms the parent state into the
child state.

Picture the start state as the root of a tree. Each node (including the root)
has a child for each operator. The state at the child is the state resulting
from the operator tranforming the parent state into the child state. So, the
solution to a state-space problem is a path from the root of the tree downward
to the stop state: the result of applying that sequence of operators on the
start state, leading to the stop state.

Again, we use the term "combinatorial searching" to characterize this approach
to solving these problems, because we search through all possible combinations
of operators. If we drew out complete search trees, we would generate a
tremendous number of nodes (this is called the "combinatorial explosion"). If
the tree represents the result of C operators for each node/state, and it
takes N operators to solve the problem (the stop state is at a depth of N) the
tree can  have up to C^N nodes at depth N. So even if C is small, say 2, a
problem that requires 10 operators can lead to a search tree with 1,000 leaf
nodes; a problem requiring a solution with twice as many operators (20) can
lead to a search tree with 1,000,000 leaf nodes.

So, in the case of the water jugs problem above. The root of the tree is the
start state (0,0,8). There are 6 operators available at each state: j1-&gt;j2
(which abbreviates "pour j1 into j2"), j2-&gt;j1, j1-&gt;j3, j3-&gt;j1, j2-&gt;j3, and
j3-&gt;j2; note that for each operators ja-&gt;jb there is also the reverse operator
jb-&gt;ja, so there are always an even number of operators.

So, we will show all the states at depth 1 reachable from the start state (at
depth 0) by applying one operator as
				(0,0,8)
      /             /           /          \             \           \
   j1-&gt;j2       j2-&gt;j1       j1-&gt;j3      j3-&gt;j1        j2-&gt;j3       j3-&gt;j2  
  (0,0,8)       (0,0,8)      (0,0,8)     (3,0,5)       (0,0,8)     (0,5,3)

Now, the searching algorithm implemented in code at the end of this lecture
keeps track of which states have already been reached (think of this for now
as a set; it is really a map where the value associated with each reached state
is the sequence of operators it takes to get there, where the sequence is empty
for the root). Lots of operators, when applied to this start state, transform
the start state into the same start state (pouring from j1 to j2 does nothing
because j1 has not water in it) so we don't have to continue exploring the
subtrees of those states: only the operators labelled j3-&gt;j1 and j3-&gt;j2 change
the state. For simplicity we will redraw the tree below, omitting any node
whose state is the same as the start (root's) state.

				   (0,0,8)
                    /                                    \
                 j3-&gt;j1                                j3-&gt;j2  
                (3,0,5)                                (0,5,3)

So, we can get to the new states (3,0,5) and (0,5,3) from the start state by
applying one operator.

Next, we will show all the states at depth 2 reachable from the new states (at
depth 1) by applying one operator. Here again we don't show any operators that
lead to states that are already in the tree.

				   (0,0,8)
                    /                                    \
                 j3-&gt;j1                                j3-&gt;j2  
                (3,0,5)                                (0,5,3)
           /              \                               |
        j1-&gt;j2           j3-&gt;j2p                       j2-&gt;j1
        (0,3,5)          (3,5,0)                       (3,2,3)

Note in the subtree of the (3,0,5) node, j2-&gt;j1 transforms to (3,0,5) which is
the same as its parent state (because j2 is empty); j1-&gt;j3 transforms to(0,0,8)
which we already saw at depth 0; j3-&gt;j1 transforms to (3,0,5) which is the same
as its parent state (because j1 is already filled); j2-&gt;j3 is (3,0,5) which is
the same as its parent state (because j2 is empty). So only j1-&gt;j2 and j3-&gt;j2
transform the parent node (3,0,5) to a state tht does not already label a node
in the tree.

We can likewise discover that only j2-&gt;j1 transforms the parent node (0,5,3) to
a state that does not already label a node in the tree: j3-&gt;j2 in the right
subtree transforms (0,5,3) to (3,5,0) which already is the leftmost node at
depth 2

So, we can get to the new states (0,3,5), (3,5,0), and (3,2,3) from the start
state by applying two operators.

Next, we will show all the states at depth 3 reachable from the new states (at
depth 2) by applying one operator. Here again we don't show any operators that
lead to states that are already in the tree.

				   (0,0,8)
                    /                                    \
                 j3-&gt;j1                                j3-&gt;j2  
                (3,0,5)                                (0,5,3)
           /              \                               |
        j1-&gt;j2           j3-&gt;j2p                       j2-&gt;j1
        (0,3,5)          (3,5,0)                       (3,2,3)
          |                                               |
        j3-&gt;j1     no operators lead to                j1-&gt;j3           
        (3,3,2)  any new states: noltans               (0,2,6)

So, we can get to the new states (3,3,2) and (0,2,6) from the start state by
applying three operators.

Next, we will show all the states at depth 4 reachable from the new states (at
depth 3) by applying one operator. Here again we don't show any operators that
lead to states that are already in the tree.

        j3-&gt;j1      no operators lead                  j1-&gt;j3           
        (3,3,2)     to any new states                  (0,2,6)
          |                                               |

So, we can get to the new states (1,5,2) and (2,0,6) from the start state by
applying four operators.

Next, we will show all the states at depth 5 reachable from the new states (at
depth 4) by applying one operator. Here again we don't show any operators that
lead to states that are already in the tree.

So, we can get to the new states (0,5,3), (1,0,7), and (2,5,1) from the start
state by applying five operators.

Next, we will show all the states at depth 6 reachable from the new states (at
depth 5) by applying one operator. Here again we don't show any operators that
lead to states that are already in the tree.

            (0,1,7)                                    (3,4,1)  
               |                                         |
            j3-&gt;j1                                     j1-&gt;j3
            (3,1,4)                                    (0,4,4)

So, we can get to the new states (3,1,4) and (0,4,4) from the start state by
applying seven operators.

But (0,4,4) is the stop state! We have solved the problem as illustrated below
(this output is what my program produces, listing all the operators from the
root to the solution leaft in order (and showing the state at every depth).

  Jugs[0,0,8]: Starting State
  Jugs[0,5,3]: Transfer from jug 3 to jug 2
  Jugs[3,2,3]: Transfer from jug 2 to jug 1
  Jugs[0,2,6]: Transfer from jug 1 to jug 3
  Jugs[2,0,6]: Transfer from jug 2 to jug 1
  Jugs[2,5,1]: Transfer from jug 3 to jug 2
  Jugs[3,4,1]: Transfer from jug 2 to jug 1
  Jugs[0,4,4]: Transfer from jug 1 to jug 3
  Jugs[0,4,4]: Final State

So, by doing a breadth-first search of the tree, we examined all the states we
could reach by applying 1 operator, then by applying 2 operators, etc. until we
reached the stop state. Thus, if a solution exist we will always find the
shortest sequence of operators that lead to it (before examining any nodes at
depth n, we have examined all nodes at depth n-1).

We use a queue to perform this breadth-first search. Initially we add the start
state to the queue, and whenever we remove a state from the queue, we apply
all the operators to it (generating more states) and put those states back in
the queue (if we have not already put them in the queue: every state that is
added to the queue also is put into a map -its associated value is the sequence
of operators that were applied to the start state to get to the key state-
which we can get to see if it is present.

If a solution doesn't exist at all (imagine what would happen if the stop state
were (0,4,5)) this process would eventually lead to leaf nodes that are all
labelled noltans: operators transform their states only to states already in
the tree, so there are no new states to examine, and the program realizes
there is no solution. Because the state-space is finite, this process will
eventually yield and answer or realize that no answer is possible.


The 15s Puzzle:

Another problem solvable by state-space searching is the 15s puzzle (really
a generalization of the N^2-1 puzzle). The puzzle's state is given by a 4x4
matrix, in which the numbers 1-15 appear on tiles, with one square "empty".
For example
     0   1   2   3
   +---+---+---+---+
 0 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 2 |
   +---+---+---+---+
 1 | 15| 8 | 12| 14|
   +---+---+---+---+
 2 | 6 | 7 |   | 9 |
   +---+---+---+---+
 3 | 4 | 13| 11| 10|
   +---+---+---+---+

There are four operators:
  1) move the tile above the empty square down
  2) move the tile below the empty square up
  3) move the tile to the right of the empty square to the left
  4) move the tile to the left of the empty square to the right

An easier way to think about these four operations as to move the empty
square up, down, to the left, and to the right.

So, given a start and stop state (two matrices), a solution to the problem is
the sequence of operators (chosen from these four) needed to transform the
start state into the stop state.


As a quick side note, let's examine how many states there are in the search
space for the 15s puzzle and use big-O and big-Omega notation to bound this
number by simpler functions both from above and below.

There are 16! different possible states. First let's look at an upper bound
for n! using big-O notation.

n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n-1 x n; if we replace each value by a bigger one, n,
n! 8, the product of the
     first 1/2 of the terms is bigger than 2^(n/2) because 4 is 2^2)
  2) replace the last n/2 terms by a smaller number: n/2

n! &gt; 2^(n/2) x (n/2)^(n/2) = (2*n/2)^(n/2) = n^(n/2) = (n^n)^(1/2) = sqrt(n^n)
so n! is Omega(sqrt(n^n))

note thatr when n is 16, sqrt (n^n) ~ sqrt (16x10^18) = 4x10^9

so 4x10^9  solve_it (ics::Problem&amp; problem,
                                         ics::Queue&amp;&amp; exploring) {
  int operator_count = 0;
  ics::State start   = problem.get_start_state();
  ics::State stop    = problem.get_stop_state();

  //Trivial solutions: no operators needed
  if (stop == start) {
    std::cout ();
  }

  ics::ArraySet operators(problem.get_all_operators());

//  ics::ArrayMap&gt; solutions;            //state -&gt; ics::ArrayQueue[Operator]
  ics::ArrayMap&gt;&amp; solutions = problem.solutions;              //state -&gt; ics::ArrayQueue[Operator]
  solutions.clear();

  exploring.enqueue(start);
  solutions[start] = ics::ArrayQueue();                             //initial state -&gt; no operations

  //Are there still states to explore
  while(!exploring.empty()) {
    ics::State current_state = exploring.dequeue();                                //state to explore next

    //Try all operators and examine the state they lead to for uniqueness
    for (ics::Operator op : operators) {
      operator_count++;

      try {
        ics::State new_state = op.apply(current_state);

        if (!solutions.has_key(new_state)) {
          //extend solution to include this operator
          ics::ArrayQueue current_solution = solutions[current_state];  //operators to get to this state
          ics::ArrayQueue new_solution(current_solution);
          new_solution.enqueue(op);

          //if stop state, return solution
          if (new_state == stop) {
            std::cout ();
}

On the page that lists sample programs, there is a download for "State Space
Search" which include a few classes comprising this general problem solver,
as well as the classes Operator, State, and Problem to represent the Water Jugs
problem. When run, the application prints all the operators and then performs
both a breadth-first and best-first search for a solution, printing both the
number of nodes explored and the solution. As we discussed, breadth-first
searching will typically explore more nodes but come up with a shorter solution
than best-first searching. If the how_close method starts with the number of
operators needed to reach the current state, then the searching will be using
the A* algorithm.

Here is the actual code that calls solve_tt for each kind of search. Note that
you can speed-up best-first searching by using a HeapPriorityQueue instead of
an ArrayPriorityQueue. The how_close function in the State class determines
an integer metric of how close one state is to an other.



//Use breadth-first searching to find an "optimal" solution (the one
//  with the minimum number of operators needed to transform the initial
//  state to the final state).
ics::ArrayQueue breadth_first_solution (ics::Problem&amp; problem) {
  return solve_it(problem, ics::ArrayQueue());
}


//Use the gt function (state i has higher priority than state j if i is heuristically closer to
//  the stop state) to try to find a solution faster (search the tree, looking at fewer internal
//  states), but typically not find an optimal solution.
//The above is a pure best-first algorithm. If the gt function computes its result by adding
//  (a) teh number of operators it takes to get to a state, and
//  (b) the heuristic does not over-estimate how many operators it takes to reach the next state
//  then the result will be an "optimal" solution, typically found by examining more operators
//  than a pure best-first search but fewer than a breadth-first search.

                                                    bool (*gt)(const ics::State&amp; a, const ics::State&amp; b)) {
