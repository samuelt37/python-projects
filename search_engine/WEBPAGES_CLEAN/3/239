 thanks for posting grades! Also, will the standard letter grade scale be used? i.e. A = 90-100
B = 80-89
...
or are you curving the grades?

 When will final exam scores be up?
  I should be able to post them today (6/14).  Sorry for the delay.

 Can you post up solutions for homework 7?  Thank you.

 How do we actually plot the poisson distribution in matlab?
 
 Right now I'm thinking something like
plot(exp(-lambda)*lambda^(r(:))/r(:)!)
where r is the vector that contains all the inter-arrival times (I assume these are supposed to be the 'k' value) from the equation. However, I'm pretty sure this isn't good matlab coding.

 For 2.1 on homework 7, I'm not sure how the plot is supposed to work. What I've done is make a histogram of timestamps and told matlab to hold the plot.
 
 But my plot of the exponential distribution doesn't seem right. Do the x values come straight from timestamps, the differences between values in the time stamps, or somewhere else? I'm just not sure where we're supposed to get the 'x' in f(x) for the distribution. 
 
 Also, what should be the domain on the graph for x?
  The timestamps come from (something like) a Poisson process.  In a Poisson process, what is exponentially distributed? (It's not the time stamps.)  This is what you want to plot for part 1.  Choose a domain that looks reasonable, and enough bins to see the distribution's shape.  As you say, use "hold on;" to plot more than one thing together (e.g. the histogram and a theoretical curve).

 Are we expected to solve PHI for normal distribution?  For example, somehow code the integral from -inf to x or can we assume that PHI is given(back of book) and use that.  So if we assume that we have PHI, we can do the computation based around phi like x-mew/sigma without computing PHI.  Is that okay?
 
 If we do have to code the integral, how do we code -inf in matlab?

 For 4.1 on homework 5, do we just report whatever frequencies MATLAB spits out for T = 20? I'm not quite sure what's meant by 'relative frequencies'. I'm guessing that this question will have slightly different answers for each student, since there isn't much room for convergence with only 20 iterations.
   Relative frequency = fraction of time (out of T) that the state took on each value.  For T=20, these will be multiples of .05, for example.

 Part 2.4: Are we also plotting p(X_t = 2) on the same axis as in Part 2.3?
   Create a separate plot.

 Sorry, the question was, could convergence occur at time t = 1?
   Possible, but very unlikely to occur in practice.

 v = initial state. 
P = state transition matrix. 
pi = v*P. 
Do we need to check the case of |v - pi| &lt; epsilon?
   No, pi != v*P.  pi is the stationary distribution, i.e., pi such that pi = pi * P. In your homework, you will try to compute pi using the power method, by looking at v*P^t as t increases.  In class I called this quantity pi^(t), the approximation to pi at time t.  It is also equal to p(X_t), the marginal probability over states at time t, given initial state distribution p(X_0) = v.  You will check convergence of the power method by looking to see if these quantities are converging over time.

 I think the prof forgot.  Hopefully, he will post it on friday after lunch.
  Yes, sorry!  It's posted now.

 Professor Ihler, do you think you can post up homework 5 so we can get it started early? Thanks.

 On the solutions, can you post how much each question was worth? Or at least, what the entire assignment was worth?

 Thanks for the hw sols. They help.

 1.1:
x1 = A Xor C Xor D
x2 and x3 are found the same way.

 What is the encoding matrix for 1.1 look like?  How do we do this problem without it?
   It is depicted graphically above the problem. 
  
   
   
 Scott Cutler  —   28 April 2009, 15:36    
   
 Actually nevermind, I'm assuming the order for 1.1 will carry for 1.2.

 Unfortunately I missed the lecture on Hamming Codes. Can someone tell me the decoding matrix  order the professor uses for 1.2 ?
   It is depicted graphically above the problem.

 Problem 1.5: I'm not clear of the question: How many errors can be detected by a code in which each codeword is Hamming distance k apart?
Does this mean the distance between one codeword being sent and being recieved?
   See email to the class this afternoon.

 The Hamming (7,4) code link does not help. Wiki has nothing for this search.
   Fixed the link.

 Homework #3 (Naive Bayes): in the "Testing the classifier performance" section's fifth bullet item, which refers to writing a third function, what training data should be used to train the classifier that is sent to this function?
   Please use the training set from the first part (1..1500), and compute the probabilities of 1501..1520.

 Is there any possibility of getting answer keys for the homeworks? They don't have to work through the entire problem, but it does help when reviewing problems we can't remember how to do if we know what result we should get. Obviously, there will be lots of answers for the MATLAB questions, but any kind of key or walkthrough would be helpful so we can focus on questions we really can't figure out by ourselves during office hours.
 
 Other than that, I have been rather enjoying the homework questions.

 In the future, can you please correct any errors/typos from the homework a little earlier than two days before it's due?
   I try to correct them when I find them, or when someone else finds them and tells me.  So far, I don't see that it's been a real problem, however; the typos have all been very minor.

 On Homework #1, problem 3, I assume that the network B options occur with equal probability, right?
   For P3(4), yes, "equal probability".  For the other parts, networks A &amp; B are treated separately.

 When is the username/pswd info going to be available so that we can get at the Matlab code examples for the first homework assignment?
   Sorry -- that was a configuration error on the wiki.  Should be fixed now.
