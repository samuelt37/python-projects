   When you join the Department of Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, you will become part of a program which encompasses broad educational and research programs in all areas of computing. The department is experiencing several major changes this fall--from new faculty to upgraded computer labs--reflecting UCI's heightened commitment to high-quality education and research in Information and Computer Science. 
 Buoyed by the state's burgeoning high-tech industry, ICS is expanding its research and educational programs. Eight professors have joined our acclaimed group of faculty this fall, bringing the total number of faculty to 37. ICS is currently recruiting four additional faculty, 50 new Ph.D. students (with full fellowships available), 40 new M.S. students (with industrial interships available), and 250 new undergraduates (with full scholarships available).  </body>
