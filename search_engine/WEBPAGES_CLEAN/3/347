 Asst. 4 * Data Types and Expressions<body>
  
 
   This shorter-than-usual assignment is due
on Monday, February 14, by 7:00 p.m. in the locking box in CS 189.  Turn
in everything you have completed at that time.  
 
  Summary:   In this assignment you will
explore data types and expressions.  
 
  Readings and review questions:   This
assignment covers most of Sebesta, chapters 5 and 6.  You should know the
answers to the review questions listed below, but you do not have to turn
them in.  This list should help you identify some of the more important
concepts in the text.  (On the other hand, don't infer that the topics
we skip or omit are entirely  un important.)  
 
 Chapter 5:  1-8, 13, 14, 17-19, 22, 24, 26-32  
 
 Chapter 6:  1-5, 7-12, 14-16  
 
  (a)   In the Sebesta text, do problems
1 and 2 in the problem set starting on page 255.  For Problem 2, he's
referring to storing each decimal digit separately in memory, rather than
representing the entire decimal value in binary.  
 
 It's a good idea to think about the comparisons
that other problems in this chapter address, even though we're not assigning
them.  
 
  (b)  In the problem set starting on
page 284 of Sebesta:  
  
 Pick two of these three problems:  4, 7, and
8.  
   
 Do four of the sub-parts of problem 10.  (This
problem starts with the word "Assume"--the actual number 10 is
missing from the page, at least in early printings.)  
   
 For problem 11, do two of the parts you did
in problem 10.  
   
 Do problems 14 and 15.
