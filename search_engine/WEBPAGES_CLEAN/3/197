   Abstract:  
Varying partial bypassing in pipelined processors is an
effective way to make performance, area and energy tradeoffs
in embedded processors. However, performance evaluation
of partial bypassing in processors has been inaccurate,
largely due to the absence of bypass-sensitive retargetable
compilation techniques. Furthermore no existing
partial bypass exploration framework estimates the power
and cost overhead of partial bypassing. In this paper we
present PBExplore: A framework for Compiler-in-the-Loop
exploration of partial bypassing in processors. PBExplore
accurately evaluates the performance of a partially bypassed
processor using a generic bypass-sensitive compilation
technique. It synthesizes the bypass control logic and
estimates the area and energy overhead of each bypass configuration.
PBExplore is thus able to effectively perform
multi-dimensional exploration of the partial bypass design
space. We present experimental results on the Intel XScale
architecture on MiBench benchmarks and demonstrate the
need, utility and exploration capabilities of PBExplore.
