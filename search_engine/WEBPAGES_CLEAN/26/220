   Abstract:  
Software generation for embedded systems is very
complex because of the wide variety of architectural
styles diverse application domains and design goals. In
this paper we present a customizable retargetable compiler 
framework that determines the phase-ordering between 
transformations dynamically based on the resource availability 
and the program region characteristics. We present some 
experiments with ordering If-Conversion - a predicated 
execution technique, and Speculative code motion. The results 
indicate that flexibility in the ordering of the transformations 
is important while compiling for embedded systems. Our
future work includes performing experiments exploring the 
various phase orderings and also incorporating more 
transformations into the EXPRESS compiler.
