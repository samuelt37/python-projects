  Experiment 1 Results  
      Trials to learn t(16) = 1.91 p &lt;.05
 
  Logical A ? (B???C) ?  FireInFall 	27.6
  Feature C ? (B ??A)  ?  FireInFall 	50.4
        Total Errors   t(16) = 2.135 p &lt;.05
 
  Logical	  6.8
  Feature	14.0
      
 
    Summary- Prior knowledge is being used to constrain the search for hypotheses (in addition to features), but too many errors to be explained by Explanation-Based Learning Methods
