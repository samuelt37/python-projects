                 Before You Install...  

 Chimera makes use of the following third-party software. These packages need to be installed prior to installing Chimera. In order for the ChimeraÂ 2.0 servers to compile and execute correctly, the Java classes contained in these packages must be specified in the  CLASSPATH  environment variable. 

 Java Foundation Classes 

 The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are currently available from  JavaSoft . Eventually, the JFC will be merged into the standard Java Development Kit and the need for this separate download will go away. The JFC is currently at version 1.1 (Swing version 1.0.2). We test and develop Chimera using the &lt; swingall.jar &gt; file that comes with the JFC 1.1 download. 

 Rivendell Tool Server 

 The  Rivendell Tool Server  can be downloaded from the  Programming Systems Lab  at Columbia University. Rivendell is currently at version 0.6. In order to use Rivendell, two additional software packages must be obtained: 

   HTTP Client , version 0.3. 
      Java Servlet Development Kit , version 1.0 or higher. 
  AElfred XML Parser 

 A fast, compact XML parser from OpenText, Inc. This software package can be downloaded free of charge from  OpenText's website . The current version is 1.2a. 



 Simple API for XML (SAX) 

 An interface shared by a variety of XML Parsers. If for some reason, 
AElfred becomes a thing of the past, Chimera can switch to using any
SAX-Compliant XML parser to do its parsing. SAX can be downloaded from
 Megginson Technologies's website 
.
