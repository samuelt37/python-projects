Competitive Generalized Auctions
 
Matt Nguyen
 

 
This is a presentation of the paper "Competitive Generalized Auctions"
by Jason Hartline, Amos Fiat, Andrew Goldberg, and Anna Karlin,
STOC 2002.
  
The authors describe mechanisms for auctions that are truthful while
guaranteeing no net loss in profit (to the auctioneer).  One such concept
is of being able to cancel an auction.  These cancelable auctions have the
property that if the revenue collected does not meet a certain
predetermined criteria, then the auction can be cancelled and still remain
truthful.  My talk will focus on these cancelable auctions.
