           modelListFromTable ( results ,
         columnNames = None )  
      Given a table (2D array) of result items, where each row 
      represents an row / item / object from the database, create an 
      equivalent list of RowItemModels representing those items. 
           
            
            
           
           
     
         
      
           modelDictFromList ( modelList ,
         columnName ,
         listValues = False )  
      Given a list of model objects, create a dictionary keyed by the 
      models' values of the columnName attribute with values equal to the 
      corresponding model objects. 
           
            
            
           
           
     
         
      
             columnFromModelList ( modelList ,
         columnName )  
      Given a list of model objects and the name of a "column"
      / attribute, return a list representing a "column" of those
      values, one from each model object.

     modelListFromTable ( results ,
         columnNames = None ) 
   
     
     
     Given a table (2D array) of result items, where each row represents an
  row / item / object from the database, create an equivalent list of 
  RowItemModels representing those items. 
  If the columnNames are not supplied, then requires that the first row 
  of the results table actually be the names of the columns to key the 
  items of the RowItemModels by. If used the DBUtil.execute method, this is
  easy as you just need to set the "includeColumnNames" 
  parameter.
        
  
 
   
     
     modelDictFromList ( modelList ,
         columnName ,
         listValues = False ) 
   
     
     
     Given a list of model objects, create a dictionary keyed by the 
  models' values of the columnName attribute with values equal to the 
  corresponding model objects. 
  If listValues is True, rather the dictionary values being the model 
  objects themselves, they will instead be list objects with the models 
  appended into the lists.  This would be uninteresting for "unique 
  key" columnNames as it would just create dictionary where every 
  value is a list of size 1.  However, this is important for non-unique key
  columnNames to make sure that model objects from the original list are 
  not overwritten / lost.
