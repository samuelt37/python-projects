    requiring voice and data, as well as video, are rapidly expanding and  future
    communication services must be able to facilitate a wide variety of diversified
    services in a practical and easily expandable fashion.  
 Bren School  researchers investigate
            various issues in the design and analysis of high-speed networks for multimedia
            applications. They are  actively involved in research on computer
            networks and distributed systems, with the goal of designing, analyzing and
            implementing communication systems that allow high-speed transport of multimedia
            information between end-users.  
 Research collectively addresses a complete view
            of the communications network, from the network substrate (high-speed networks,
            ATM networks, wireless networks), to end-to-end protocols support and communication
            subsystem architectures (Object-Oriented frameworks), to distributed applications
            (multimedia distance learning applications).  
 In the area of distributed systems,
            researchers are developing new programming paradigms for distributed systems
            based on the principle of autonomous messages, which achieves speed-up through
            parallel processing, and permits interactive open-ended applications through
            dynamic functional composition.
