  Abstract  

Abstract -- Software architectures enable large-scale soft
ware development. Component reuse and substitutability, two 
key aspects of large-scale development, must be planned for 
during software design. Object-oriented (OO) type theory sup
ports reuse by structuring inter-component relationships and 
verifying those relationships through type checking in an 
architecture definition language (ADL). In this paper, we iden
tify the issues and discuss the ramifications of applying OO 
type theory to the C2 architectural style. This work stems from 
a series of experiments that were conducted to investigate com
ponent reuse and substitutability in C2. We also discuss the 
limits of applicability of OO typing to C2 and how we 
addressed them in the C2 ADL.
