   Tangencies : Steiner's Porism 
 

 Suppose that you have a drawing in which a ring of k circles is tangent to 
each other, and each circle in the ring is also tangent to two more circles 
A and B.  Then, any other circle C that is tangent to A and B
along the same  bisector 
is also part of a similar ring of k circles.
This fact is known as
 Steiner's Porism .

  In the animation below, the three black 
anchors move the two circles A and B; moving the red anchor produces 
different rings of six circles for the same choice of A and B.

    

 

 The usual proof of this is simply to choose an
 inversion  that makes A and B concentric, after which 
the result follows immediately by symmetry.

  Any  three tangent circles 
have two  inscribed and circumscribed circles 
forming an instance of Steiner's porism with k=3.
When k=4, the six circles of the porism can be grouped in two other 
ways into instances of the same construction.
In this case, the graph describing the tangencies between the six circles
is the skeleton of an  octahedron .
