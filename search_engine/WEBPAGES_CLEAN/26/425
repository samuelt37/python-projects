   The expected extremes in a Delaunay triangulation .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and F. Yao.  18th Int. Coll. Automata, Languages and Programming, 
Madrid, Spain, 1991. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  510, 1991, 674–685.   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  1 (1): 79–92, 1991 .
 
Discusses the expected behavior of Delaunay triangulations for
points chosen uniformly at random (without edge effects).
The main result is that within a region containing  n  points,
the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor
of log  n  / log log  n.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.
  
In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.
  
In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have  total length within a constant factor of
optimal . Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see " Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation " for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that  any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices .
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper " Mesh generation and optimal triangulation ".

 Quadtree  based

 approximation 
to the minimum weight triangulation of a point set or
convex polygon, allowing extra Steiner points to be added as vertices.
Includes proofs of several bounds on triangulation weight relative to
the  minimum spanning tree  or non-Steiner
triangulation, and a conjecture
that for convex polygons the only points that need to be added are on
the polygon boundary.

The method is to use a
 minimum spanning tree  to find a collection of

overlaps, using Sleator and
Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to keep track of the
connectivity of the shrunken circles.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

    Topological issues in hexahedral meshing . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at
 Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science , Stanford, 2001.
 
We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

This follows on to our previous paper on
 using graph matching to cover a

extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned

We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.
