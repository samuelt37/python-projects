  Replicators : B01367/S012 

  
B01367/S012  has an 11c/22 replicator: 

     

 It also has a larger 10c/20 replicator: 

     

 This pattern, based on the smaller replicator, is a rake, moving
in one direction at 11c/22 and, every 22 steps, spitting out a
small c/2 glider moving in the opposite direction. 

     

 A different tail turns the 11c/22 replicator into a more
conventional spaceship. 

     

 Finite oscillators with periods that are multiples of 22 can be
made from the replicator by blocking it by small p2's. The
following example repeats with period 44. 

     

 Combinations of oscillators can be used to make glider guns; for
instance this p44 gun produces 11c/22 spaceships. By adjusting the
lengths of the oscillators, higher multiple-of-22 periods can also
be achieved. It seems likely that guns for simpler gliders (such as
the 3x2 or 4x2 c/2's) can be constructed similarly. 

     

 A simpler pattern can be used for higher period 11c/22 spaceship
guns. Here, the period is 88. 

     

 Another interesting replicator-based pattern is the following
breeder, which moves at 12c/24, at each repetition leaving behind a
replicator at right angles to its path. As the pattern evolves the
system of replicators behind the breeder forms a two-dimensional
Sierpinski triangle fractal pattern. 

     

 The breeder produces O(n 1.585 ) live cells after n
generations.  

  With random initial conditions, this rule eventually develops into a
chaotic pattern in which small patches of dead cells are filled with
live oscillators or vice versa. Therefore, it seems likely that most
patterns eventually lead to a quadratic growth in the number of live
cells.  However, an explicit quadratic growth pattern remains unknown.
