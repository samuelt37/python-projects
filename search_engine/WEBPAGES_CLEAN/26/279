The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

    Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212007 .  
 19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281 .
 
We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

A  straight skeleton  is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

We consider problems of determining when a curve in the plane is the
projection of a 3d surface with no vertical tangents. Several problems
of this type are NP-complete, but can be solved in polynomial time if a

    Dilation, smoothed distance, and minimization diagrams of

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

    Animating a continuous family of two-site distance function

and D. Eppstein.   25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, video and
multimedia track, pp. 92–93 .
 
We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a  Manhattan orbifold  and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L 1  plane.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

    Privacy-preserving data-oblivious geometric algorithms for
geographic data . 
D. Eppstein,

Information Systems (ACM GIS 2010) , San Jose, California, pp. 13–22 .  arXiv:1009.1904 .
 
An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.
  
    Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the

Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .

We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams
that determine the closest two point sites to a query point, where the
distance from the query point to a pair of sites is a combination of the
individual distances to the sites and the distance from one site in the
pair to the other.

We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

Algorithms  36: 18–26, 2016 .  
If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.
