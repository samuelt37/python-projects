         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    Objects of user-defined types cannot directly be assigned to or from
objects of even a closely related type. A  type conversion  allows
the assignment to be made:
 type BUS_VAL is range 0 to 255;

variable X_INT : integer := 22;
variable X_BUS : BUS_VAL;
...
X_BUS := X_INT;                     --illegal
X_BUS := BUS_VAL(X_INT);  
    
  

 
     Closely related types  are
  integer types and real types
  array types whose lengths, index types and element types match.
  
For instance
 type T_BYTE is array (7 downto 0)
     of std_ulogic;
signal TYPE_BUS : T_BYTE;
signal VEC_BUS :
     std_ulogic_vector(7 downto 0);
...
TYPE_BUS &lt;= VEC_BUS;                --illegal
TYPE_BUS &lt;= T_BYTE(VEC_BUS);  
    
  

 
    If conversion is required between types which are not closely
related, a user defined function must be used:
 signal X_BOOL: boolean;
signal X_STD:  std_ulogic;
function BOOL_TO_SL(X : boolean)
            return std_ulogic is
begin
  if X then
    return ('1');
  else
    return ('0');
  end if;
end BOOL_TO_SL;
...
X_STD &lt;= X_BOOL;                    --illegal
X_STD &lt;= BOOL_TO_SL(X_BOOL);
  
    
  

 
    A type conversion function may be called in a port map, to match
port type to signal type. 
    
  

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    Most logic synthesis tools support type conversion for appropriate
array and integer types.
 
Most also accept the type conversion functions in the std_logic_1164
package.
  
Some synthesis vendors supply a  VHDL  package containing conversion
functions which the synthesiser will spuuort.
  
Conversion functions in port maps are not usually supported.

Type Conversions have not changed in  VHDL -93.
