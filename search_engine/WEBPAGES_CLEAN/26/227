            Billy Graham Comes To L.A.    
        
           
                On the 55th anniversary of his first crusade in LA, Billy Graham is back at the Rose Bowl! Some have speculated that this may be Mr. Graham's second-to-last crusade (another crusade is being planned in New York next year). Anyways, I went last night to the Rose Bowl and the crusade turned out to be a great event. Michael W. Smith (a singer), Jim Cavaziel (Passion's "Jesus" actor), and Janice Hahn (an LA councilwoman) were there with Mr. Graham. If you are interested in seeing Mr. Graham, here is the info:  Saturday (7:30 - 9:30): Kutless, Tait, Third Day, and then Billy Graham. Sunday (3:30 - 5:30): Jars of Clay, Marcos Witt, Michael Reagan, choir (including my mom and sister) and then Billy Graham.  Admission is free, parking is $10, and you should be there an hour in advance. More than 70,000 people attended last night.   Update:</strong> Saturday and Sunday nights turned out to be very big events. On Saturday night, 93,000 people came out for the youth concert and packed the Rose Bowl to full capacity. On Sunday night, over 80,000 heard Michael Reagan's stirring personal testimony as well as Graham's sermon on the second coming of Christ (read  BGEA's concluding news report ). If you are interested in knowing God but missed attending the crusade, don't worry. Just read the  steps to peace with God  (which I've adapted from a Billy Graham tract).
