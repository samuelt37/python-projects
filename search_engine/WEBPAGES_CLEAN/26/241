26.2 Extensions to Daylight SMILES 
 

 
The OEChem SMILES parsers support several minor extensions to Daylight
syntax.  Each of these extensions and its motivations are listed
below.

  
    Quadruple Bond</strong> 
 In addition to ``-'', ``='' and ``#'' for specifying single, double and
triple bonds respectively, OEChem also supports ``$'' for specifying
quadruple bonds.  An example would be octachlorodirhenate (III), which
is written as `` [Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)$[Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl ''.

 
  
  Unquoted and Additional Elements</strong> 
 In addition to the standard Daylight unquoted elements, B, C, N, O, F,
P, S, Cl, Br and I, OEChem's SMILES readers also allow H, D and T to
specify hydrogen, deuterium and tritium.  Additionally, to support
Syracuse SMILES, ``CL'' and ``BR'' are considered ``Cl'' and ``Br''.  The
periodic table is also extended from 102 to 109 elements,  i.e. 
 [Sg]  for Seaborgium, with the addition of  [D]  and
 [T]  representing  [2H]  and  [3H]  respectively.

 
OEChem may support `` Na '', `` Li '' and `` K '' as
unquoted elements to support Syracuse SMILES at some point in the future.

  
  
  Aromatic Tellurium</strong> 
 In order to support OpenEye's aromaticity model, which allows
Tellurium to be aromatic, the SMILES parser has been extended to
support `` [te] '', such as in tellurophene, `` [te]1cccc1 '',
which follows in the sequence furan (`` o1cccc1 ''),
thiophene (`` s1cccc1 '') and selenophene (`` [se]1cccc1 '').

 
  
  Atom Maps in Molecules</strong> 
 Traditionally, SMILES atom maps,  i.e.   [Pb:1] , are only ever
used and
specified in reaction molecules,  [Pb:1]Â»[Au:1] .  However, OEChem
extends this notion to allow atom maps to be used in discrete molecules.
This is often useful for denoting significant sites or attachment points
in a molecule.  Traditionally in SMILES, isotopes of element zero have
been used to perform role, however in OEChem both  [*:1]  and
 [1*]  may be used.

 
  
  RGroup Attachment Points</strong> 
 As a short hand to support specifying templates for combinatorial
libraries, and to support existing Cactus and JChem/Marvin usage,
OEChem allows ``[R2]'' to be used as short-hand for [*:2].  For
inquiring minds, the SMILES [R2:3] is interpreted as [*:3] or [R3],
with the last specification taking priority.

 
  
  External Bond Attachment Points</strong> 
 OEChem SMILES also allows supports external closures, or potentially
unsatisfied "ring closures".  These have the syntax, ampersand followed
by a ring closure specification,  i.e.  an optional bond order followed
by either a digit or a `%' character and two digits.  The index space
of external bonds and ring closures is separate, so that the ring
closure ``2'' and the external attachment point ``&amp;2'' are unrelated.

 
When external attachment points are paired within a SMILES string,
they behave identically to ring closures, just using a separate index
space.  Hence, the SMILES ``c&amp;1ccccc&amp;1'' is interpreted the same
way as ``c1ccccc1'', and ``C&amp;1.C&amp;1'' is interpreted like ``C1.C1'',
i.e the SMILES ``CC''.

  
However, unlike ring closures, unpaired external attachment points
are allowed and are interpreted like RGroup attachment points above.
Hence, the SMILES `` CC&amp;1 '' (on its own) is equivalent to the RGroup
attachment SMILES  CC[R1] , which is equivalent to the atom mapped
molecule  CC[*:1] .

  
The major advantage of these semantics, inspired by Daylight's CHUCKLES,
is that it allows convenient enumeration of combinatorial libraries
using string concatenation.  For example, three components of a library
may be specified as `` C&amp;1CCC&amp;2 '', `` F&amp;1 '' and
`` Br&amp;2 ''.  The using the same notation
`` C&amp;1CCC&amp;2.F&amp;1.Br&amp;2 '' is interpreted as the reaction
product,  i.e.  `` FCCCCBr ''.

  
As with ring closures, bond orders may be specified after the ampersand
and before the closure index, `` C&amp;=1 '', and two digit closures are
indicated by a ' % ' prefix,  i.e.  `` C&amp;%12 '' or
`` C&amp;=%12 ''.
