3.17.10 Delete Conformers 
 

 
    
virtual bool DeleteConf(OEConfBaseT&lt;C,dim&gt; *) = 0
virtual void DeleteConfs() = 0
    
The first function deletes the conformer which is passed in from the
OEMCMolBase.

  
 DeleteConfs()  deletes all of the conformers from an OEMCMolBaseT.
This is a very useful function for creating a new transformed OEMCMolBaseT
from an untransformed molecule.  However,  DeleteConfs()  leaves the
OEMCMolBaseT in an unstable state.  It should be used with care an followed
shortly with a call to  NewConf() .
