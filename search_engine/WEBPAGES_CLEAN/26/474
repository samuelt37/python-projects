   Course News 

 

 

  Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first). 

   Date Added 
     News Item 
     W 12/19 
     The  final course grades  are now available. 
     Sa 12/8 
     The remaining  code example  and a final  Schedule  update are now available. 
     W 12/5 
     Recent  code examples  demonstrating exceptions, exception safety, and building standard-library-compliant containers are now available. 
     Su 12/2 
      Project #5  is now available. 
     F 11/30 
      Project #4  is now due on Monday, December 3 at 11:59pm. 
     W 11/28 
     A new  code example  demonstrating the "polymorphic clone" pattern, which is useful in  Project #4 , is now available. 
     W 11/21 
     Yesterday's  code examples  — detailing the use of template functions, template classes, and pseudorandom number generation — are now available. 
     Tu 11/20 
     I've changed the due date of  Project #4  to Friday, November 30 to accommodate the holiday this week, making sure there are two more days I'll be on campus before it's due. 
     M 11/19 
      Project #4  is now available.  One section of the write-up, detailing the use of the random number generators built into the C++ standard library, is still unwritten; I'll add it as soon as it's ready, but there's plenty to chew on for the time being. 
     Sa 11/17 
     Thursday's  code example  is now available. 
     W 11/14 
     All of the missing  code examples  are now available. 
     Th 11/8 
      Project #3  is now available. 
     W 11/7 
     A  Schedule  update is now available. 
     Su 10/28 
     I've extended the  Project #2  deadline to Wednesday, November 7, for the benefit of those of you who would prefer to spend more time studying for the midterm. 
     F 10/26 
       Project #2  is now available.  Also, a bug was found in the "well-behaved" Vector  code example .  In the assignment operator, this line: 
        arrayCopy(newItems, items, v.sz);  
     should be this instead: 
        arrayCopy(newItems, v.items, v.sz);  
     The  code example  has been updated to include the fix. 
     
     F 10/26 
     Yesterday's  code example  is now available. 
     Th 10/25 
     Tuesday's  code example  is now available. 
     Sa 10/20 
     Two new  code examples  and a  schedule  update are now available. 
     Tu 10/16 
     Today's talk about arrays has been wrapped up into an "odds-and-ends"  code example . 
     M 10/15 
     There are now "TA hours" scheduled for this course.  See the  Course Reference  for times and locations. 
     Su 10/14 
      Project #1  is now available.  Some aspects of this project depend on things we'll be discussing in the upcoming week, but it should certainly be possible to get started on it.  Additionally, a  Schedule  update is available. 
     W 10/10 
     Yesterday's  code examples  are now available, along with a minor  Schedule  update. 
     Su 10/7 
     A  Schedule  update is now available.

       Welcome!  I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on this course web site, and also to keep an eye on it as it evolves throughout the quarter.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the  Course Reference , the  Schedule , and the  Project Guide , as well as a set of commented  Code Examples  that will be posted during the course of the quarter.
