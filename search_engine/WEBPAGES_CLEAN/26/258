Set-Difference Range Queries
 
 
Joe Simons
 
 
We introduce the problem of performing set-difference range queries,
where answers to queries are set-theoretic symmetric differences
between sets of items in two geometric ranges. We describe a general
framework for answering such queries based on a novel use of data
streaming sketches we call  signed symmetric-difference 
sketches. We show that such sketches can be realized using invertible
Bloom filters (IBFs), which can be composed, differenced, and searched
so as to solve set-difference range queries in a wide variety of
scenarios.
