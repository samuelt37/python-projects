2.1 Native Compilers 
 
The only native compilers unable to build OpenEye's libraries are
SUN Microsystem's Forte compilers, Microsoft Visual C/C++ prior to
versions 7.1 and system compilers on RedHat 6.x and earlier.  Although
RedHat 6.2 and RedHat 7.x both shipped with g++ 2.96, the 2.96s that
come with RedHat 7.2 and later work fine.

 
On IA-64 HP-UX, we recommend at least the following patch levels of the
HP C and C++ compilers:
    
cc: HP aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.41 [Nov 1 2002]
aCC: HP aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.50 [May 15 2003]
    
On HP PA-RISC HP-UX, we recommend at least the following patch levels of
the HP C and C++ compilers:
    
cpp.ansi: HP92453-01 B.11.11.06 HP C Preprocessor (ANSI)
ccom: HP92453-01 B.11.11.28706.GP HP C Compiler
/usr/ccs/bin/ld: 92453-07 linker linker ld B.11.37 030909
aCC: HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.03.45
    
On MIPS IRIX, MIPSPro C/C++ v7.41 or later is recommended.

  
On IBM AIX, Visual Age C/C++ (xlC) version 6.1 or later is recommended.

  
On HP/Compaq Tru64 v5.1 (Rev. 732), we currently use Compaq C V6.4-215 (dtk)
and Compaq C++ V6.5-014.
