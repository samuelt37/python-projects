&gt; Folks should be aware of the if-match headers &amp; entity tag things that
&gt; got added to HTTP/1.1; while these were instituted primarily to deal
&gt; with caching of negotiated content, they're also useful and important
&gt; for version management, I think.

Larry, thanks for pointing this out.  I've been thinking a lot
about the "variant" language in the HTTP spec and how it might
interact with the WEBVERS-WG concerns.
