        DataGuard Source Code 

    	 
    		Our goal is to release the DataGuard middleware as an open source software.
    		We have currently developed a prototype, which we intent to thoroughly test before
    		releasing it to the public.
    	 

    	 
    		If you want to get the source code of DataGuard and collaborate with us feel free
    		to contact one of the authors.
