       Course Overview 
        
           The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic principles of Artificial Intelligence. 
           Topics covered Include: Heuristic search, Adversarial search, Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Knowledge representation, Reasoning and Planning.
           We will cover much of the content of chapters 1-14 in the course book.

        
         
       Assignments: 
        
           There will be weekly homework-assignments, a project, and a final.

        
         
       Course-Grade: 
        
           Homeworks will account for 20% of the grade, project 30% of the grade, final 50% of the grade.

        
         

       Project 
        
           You will be required to do a project. This includes submitting a written report at the end of the quarter :

              Due to the large number of students enrolled, each project will be a team project (3-4 stundents per team). 
             Project involves writing a computer program to solve one of the following four problems :

             
                           N-queens : 
                           input is an integer N;
                           output should be a sequence of integers (ranging [1,N]) of length N, containing a position of a queen in each column, left to right. 
                         (classic) Sokoban, 
                           input is 5 lines defining the board :   
                              sixeH sizeV, e.g. "3 5" 
                               nWallSquares a list of coordinates of wall squares, e.g. "12 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 3 5 1 5 2 5 3" 
                               nBoxes a list of coordinates of boxes, e.g. "1 3 2" 
                               nStorageLocations a list of coordinates of storage locations, e.g. "1 4 2" 
                               playes initial locatin x and y, e.g. "2 2" 
                            
                           output is a single line, beginning with nMoves followed by a sequence of letters (U,D,L,R) indicating direction of the move, e.g. "1 D".     
                          Sudoku :
                           input is a sequence of 81 interers ranging [0,9], encoding the initial board position, left-to-right and top-down, with 0 for empty squares; 
                           output should be a sequence of numbers ranging [1,9]. 
                         Mastermind : 
                           input is (a) number of colors and positions, (b) a response to each guess by the computer; 
                           output is a series of guesses, each consisting of a color per position. 
                            Each team needs to submit a written report (one report per team) at the end of the course (exact date TDB). 
             There will be a competition between teams solving the same problem; team with best performing program will get bonus points. 
             Teams should be formed and project proposals finalized/approved by early Nov at the latest.
