 Abstract  
This paper addresses the problem of computing the minimal models 
of a given CNF propositional theory. We present two groups of
algorithms. Algorithms in the first group are efficient when the theory
is almost Horn, that is, when there are few non-Horn clauses and/or
when the set of all literals that appear positive in any non-Horn clause
is small. Algorithms in the other group are efficient when the theory
can be represented as an acyclic network of low-arity relations. Our
algorithms suggest several characterizations of tractable subsets for
the problem of finding minimal models.
