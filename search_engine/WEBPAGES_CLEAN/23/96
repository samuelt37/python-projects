              Select which source / vendor annotation field to perform a text search on.
                    Options include:
                  Chemical name:  Any field representing the name of the chemical,
                    systematic or common. For example, find "tylenol" or "acetaminophen,"
                    or "serine" or "2-amino-3-hydroxy-propanoic acid"
                  External ID: The ID number / string that the source refers to the
                    chemical as.  For example, you could input a CAS registry number
                    or PubChem Substance ID here, and most likely the respective
                    chemical will be found.
                  All annotations:  Searches through all of the annotations values,
                    including names, IDs and any other descriptors the sources provide
                    about their chemicals.

              Full-text search of source / vendor annotations, such as chemical names
                    (systematic and common)
                  Powered by the  Lucene 
                    simple search module, allowing for respective special command characters.
                  The search is case-insensitive and should automatically separate
                    out word components by spaces and punctuation marks.

              If you are unsure of the spelling for a chemical name,
                    enter your best guess and select the "fuzzy" style search option.
                  This will not only find chemicals with exactly matching
                    name components, but those which are "similar" to the search name.
               
            Structure Search 
             SMILES 
          Top  
       
              Search for chemicals in the ChemDB with similar structure to a query structure
                    by entering a SMILES string representing the query structure here.
                  Enter multiple SMILES strings (one per line) to perform a profile-based
                    concensus search which searches for items similar to every structure listed.
                    Especially useful when combined with the  sub-structure search option 
                    to search for chemicals containing several desired functional groups.
                  To sketch a structure instead of specifying a SMILES string,
                    click on the sketch icon.    To convert various molecular file formats into SMILES, try the online
                     Babel  tool.
                  For more information on the de facto standard SMILES string representation,
                    spend a few minutes with the
                     Daylight SMILES Tutorial 
               
             Tversky Parameters 
          Top  
       
              When performing a similarity search, additional parameters besides the
                    query structure(s) may be specified to fine-tune the query.  In particular,
                    the α and β parameters of the Tversky similarity measure
                    may be used to fine-tune the search towards a "super-structure" or "sub-structure" search.
                  For most basic needs, just use the drop-list to select either a Similar or
                    Sub-structure style search which will set reasonable default values for the
                    α and β parameters.
                  The sub-structure search option is especially useful for finding chemicals
                    which possess the query structure as a sub-structure / functional group.
                  For more detailed information on how to use the α and β parameters,
                    refer to the  Daylight Tversky Index Description .
               
             Strict Substructure 
          Top  
       
              While the similarity α and β parameters can be used to bias towards
                    a sub-structure search, they may still yield some "false positives."  That is,
                    structures which have something very similar to the search structures as
                    sub-structures, but not exactly.
                  In combination with substructure biasing α and β parameters, select
                    this option to enforce "strict" substructure searching.  Any results returned must
                    have the exact search structures as substructures, not just something "similar."
           
             Similarity Threshold 
          Top  
       
              Minimum similarity score that any search results must satisfy for similarity searches.
                  Value should be between 0.0 and 1.0
                  This value is necessary to enable fast similarity searches.
                    A "full" search used to be supported which would not use such a threshold,
                    scanning the entire database for similar molecules.  This allowed for the
                    calculation of additional statistics such as a z-score for each result
                    and a similarity distribution histogram and .
                    However, this method would take
                    ~30 seconds per search and has thus since been disabled.
           
            Basic Filters 
             SMILES / CDB Chemical ID 
          Top  
       
              Search for chemicals having a specific SMILES string or CDB Chemical IDs
                    by selecting one of these from the drop-list.
                  CDB Chemical ID is the numerical identifier used in the ChemDB system
                    to specify every unique chemical.
                  Enter one or more SMILES strings or CDB Chemical IDs (but not both)
                    into the text box, one item per line.  Only chemicals which
                     exactly  match one of these values will appear in the results.
                  To sketch a chemical structure instead of specifying a SMILES string,
                    click on the sketch icon.    To convert various molecular file formats into SMILES, try the online
                     Babel  tool.
                  For more information on the de facto standard SMILES string representation,
                    spend 15 minutes with the  Daylight SMILES Tutorial 
                  When searching for chemicals by exact SMILES, as opposed to the similarity search,
                    the match must be exact with what is stored in the database.
                  The database only stores the canonical SMILES
                    ( OEChem  implementation)
                    for each chemical, thus, arbitrarily constructed SMILES entered into the search field
                    are unlikely to match any canonical SMILES, however...
                  The system will automatically convert your entered SMILES into
                    canonical SMILES representations before searching for exact matches in the database.
               
             Molecular Descriptors 
          Top  
       
              To search for chemicals by molecular descriptors, select the descriptors from the drop-lists.
                  Enter a lower-limit (inclusive) and upper-limit (exclusive) for the descriptor.
                  Note that multiple descriptor drop-lists and limit fields are provided to
                    allow for the specification of multiple filters simultaneously ("and" logic).
                  If no limit values are specified, all possible values will be accepted.
                  The chemical search results will include the values for all descriptors selected
                    (whether or not limit values are actually provided).
