 I'd like to work with images.  I'd prefer to work on a project that has not been implemented elsewhere, but I can be swayed.  
 
 So I'd slightly prefer the jigsaw helper or something with google earth images, but I could be convinced to do the image transforms project or the auto identity tagging.  
 
 The idea of a facebook app does make the auto ID tagging project appealing.

 I'm also undecided, but Ian's leading indicators project and the auto identity tagging sound really interesting. Perhaps we could make a facebook app. that can auto tag albums?

 I am still woefully undecided, but I'm leaning toward either the jigsaw helper or ian's "leading indicators" idea.  Are other people in the class still undecided, or have you already formed groups?

 There are lots of interesting ideas but I would like to work on a finance related project. If others are also interested let's try to form a group. Some ideas for specific projects include 1) Trying to find leading indicators and segment stocks into groups with common leading indicators. 2) Find unusual events in stock histories 3) Try to find better models then random walk for stock volatility.

 I think I'd like to do the Jigsaw puzzle assistant project.  It isn't related to my research, but I'd like to know more about computer vision and the more I think about it the more I like this project.  Also, I think it would make a nice demo.  So if there are a few more people interested in this, we can form a group.
