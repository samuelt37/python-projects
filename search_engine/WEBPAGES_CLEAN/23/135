28. Valence Models 
 

 
This section describes the two (three?) valence models currently implemented by
OEChem.  For molecules that have fully specified formal charges, the MDL
valence model may be used to assign hydrogen counts.  For molecules that have
fully specified hydrogen counts, the OpenEye ``charge'' model may be used to
assign formal charges.  Finally, for molecules with neither formal charges nor
hydrogen counts, OEChem uses the OpenEye HCount model to assign both hydrogen
counts and formal charges.
