      Afternoon of Aug 4 (tentative)</strong> 
     Poster session at ICGSE  </strong>  
    ICGSE 2016 will include a posters category for late-breaking and preliminary results, smaller results not suitable for a full or short paper, and practices and experiences not yet validated through research studies.
In addition, organizations engaged in deploying global software teams are encouraged to use this venue to present their management approaches to distributed teams. 

 Posters will be presented in a special poster session on Thursday afternoon, August 4th (tentative) where presenters will interact directly with conference attendees. 

       Poster Submission Requirements</strong> 

 Poster submissions should consist of a 2-page paper describing the poster, in the same format as conference papers (IEEE Proceedings Format). Papers will be included in the conference proceedings. Please submit the 2-page paper in PDF format and name this file ContactAuthorsLastName.pdf. The paper should include author names (not anonymous submission). 

 The person submitting the poster must register for the ICGSE 2016 conference, attend, and present the poster in order for the poster to be displayed and included in the proceedings. 

 Poster submissions must be sent to  icgse2016posters@gmail.com  by 11:59 pm PDT on April 15, 2016 to be considered. 


 All questions should be directed to   etrainer@cs.cmu.edu  

       Printing and Displaying Your Poster</strong> 

 Posters should use the International Standards Organization (ISO) 216 European A1 format in portrait orientation. The dimensions for A1 format are 594mm x 841mm, or 23.4” x 33.1”.  

 The conference will provide easels, blank foam boards of size 24” x 35”, clips, and push pins. Presenters may bring their posters already printed on foam boards, or they can bring rolled up posters and use the clips or push pins to secure them to the conference-provided foam boards.  Do not tape posters to the foam boards provided by the conference. 

   Poster Design Tips</strong> 

 The following tips may help you prepare a successful poster: 

   •	A poster should be self-explanatory for someone who just walks up to it and looks at it. 
   •	Readability is critical; use modest amount of text in a large, sans-serif font  (e.g., Helvetica). 
       -	Titles and main headings should be no smaller than 72 pt. font. 
       -	All other text should be no smaller than 36 pt. font. 
   •	Figures, tables, and charts should be large enough to read easily. 
   •	Do not print and tape pages of the abstract or paper to the poster. 
   •	Simplify what you present; subtleties and complexities can be conveyed verbally. 
   •	Include a contact address (e.g., e-mail) so someone who is interested can follow up.
