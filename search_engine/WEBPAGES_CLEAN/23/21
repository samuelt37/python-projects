Morphing Planar Graph Drawings with Bent Edges 
 
 
Pawel Pszona
 
 
I will present an algorithm for computing a discrete
(consisting of a polynomial number of linear morphs)
planar morph between two planar straight-line drawings of a graph.
It achieves polynomial size at the expense of allowing edge bends.
