    Attending one of the best keynotes ever on  #user   #centered   #software   #engineering  @  #icse2013  — Vijay Krishna (@vkrishnapalepu)  May 23, 2013  

 Yet another ICSE! This time at San Fransisco! A lot of interesting research this time around. I think ICSE lived up to its reputation much better this time (as against last year). But maybe thats just me. Two papers that i thought were really interesting:  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486835  and  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486805 . And oh yes, excellent banquet + cruise! :)
