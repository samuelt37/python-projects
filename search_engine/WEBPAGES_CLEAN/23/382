  Simple extractor just for testing purposes, essentially developing a 
  molecular formula as a molecule feature vector. 
   Conceptually develops a feature vector with one cell per element of 
  the periodic table, with values equal to the number of times the 
  respective element appears for a given input molecule. 
  Specifically develops a feature dictionary for molecules keyed by the 
  atomic symbols 
  ("C","N","O","H","Br","Cl",etc.)
  with respective count values.
