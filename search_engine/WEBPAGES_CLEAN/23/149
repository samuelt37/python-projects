The Computational Complexity of Knot and Link Problems  Dan Halem , ICS, UC Irvine 

 We consider the problem of deciding whether a polygonal knot in
3-dimensional Euclidean space is unknotted (that is, whether it is
capable of being continously deformed without self-intersection so
that is lies in a plane). We show that this problem, UNKNOTTING
PROBLEM is in NP. We also consider the problem, SPLITTING PROBLEM,
of determining whether two or more such polygons can be split(that
is, whether they are capable of being continuously deformed without
self-intersection so that they occupy both sides of a plane without
intersecting it), and show that it also is in NP. Finally we show
that the problem of determining the genus of a polygonal knot (a
generalization of the problem of determining whether it is
unknotted) is in PSPACE.
