Bumpy Pyramid Folding
 
 
Zachary Becker
 

 
We investigate folding problems for a class of petal polygons
$P$, which have an $n$-polygonal base $B$ surrounded
by a sequence of triangles. We give linear time algorithms
using constant precision to determine if $P$ can
fold to a pyramid with flat base $B$, and to determine a
triangulation of $B$ (crease pattern) that allows folding
into a convex (triangulated) polyhedron. By Alexandrov's
theorem, the crease pattern is unique if it exists,
but the general algorithm known for this theorem is
pseudo-polynomial, with very large running time; ours
is the first efficient algorithm for Alexandrov's theorem
for a special class of polyhedra. We also give a polynomial
time algorithm that finds the crease pattern to produce
the maximum volume triangulated polyhedron.
