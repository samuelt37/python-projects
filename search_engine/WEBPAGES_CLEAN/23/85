 Strip Packing with Precedence Constraints and Release Times 

 Authored by: John Augustine, Sudarshan Banerjee, Sandy Irani 

 Presented by John Augustine 

 
Abstract:
  
This paper examines two variants of strip packing: when the rectangles 
to be placed have precedence constraints and when the rectangles have
release times. Strip packing can be used to model
scheduling problems in which  tasks require a contiguous
subset of identical resources that are arranged in a linear topology.
The particular variants  studied here are motivated by 
scheduling tasks for dynamically reconfigurable 
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). For the case in which
tasks have precedence constraints, we give an  O (log  n )
approximation, where  n  is the number of tasks.
We also give a 3-approximation for the special case in which
all the rectangles to be placed have uniform height.
For release times, we provide an asymptotic polynomial time 
(1+ε)-approximation scheme. We make the standard assumption 
that the rectangles have height at most 1. In addition, we also 
require widths to be in (&amp;epsilon  n  , 1]. Our algorithm runs in time 
polynomial in  n , 1/ε, and 1/&amp;epsilon  n  .
