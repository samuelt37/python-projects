 Undergraduate Student Policies 

 
 

 Laptop Requirement and Computer Use 
 Beginning in Fall 2014, students enrolling in ICS 31/CSE 41, ICS 32/CSE 42, and ICS 33/CSE 43 are required to own a personal laptop for coursework. 
    »</strong>  If You're Planning to Get a New Laptop</strong> 
 Students receiving financial aid in the fall can request an additional one-time budget increase of up to $2,000 for a new computer. The additional funding available is limited to student and/or parent loans, depending on eligibility and borrowing limits. This allowance covers hardware, software, monitor, printer, and extended warranty. 
Students are encouraged to visit or contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, 102 Aldrich Hall, by email at  finaid@uci.edu , or phone at (949) 824-8262, for details on the budget increase process and limitations.
    »</strong>  Computer Specifications</strong> 
  RAM: 8 GB or higher 
 Hard drive: 500 GB or more 
 USB drive or External Hard Drive for data back-ups 
 Weight: Students are expected to bring their laptops to class so please consider weight if this is a factor for you 
 Screen: When writing/debugging programs, more screen space tends to be very useful 
 Warranty: Extended hardware warranty is recommended 
 A backpack suitable to carry your laptop 
   *If you have a laptop that was purchased within the last 4 years, the system should be adequate for lower division work. Your computer should be running an operating system which will receive security updates and should be minimum 2 GB of RAM and have sufficient hard drive space to install required programs.   
 Recommended, but not required: 
  Laptop cable and lock 
 External monitor, keyboard and mouse 
 Small black &amp; white laser printer (Printers for use are available throughout campus; nominal fee to print) 
    If you need to connect from off-campus to UCI's network, check out the  UCI Libraries' page  on  this  topic to get set up.
