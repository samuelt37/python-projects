  (1/2017) Glad to announce that the recent  Couchbase Analytics extension  is based on the Apache AsterixDB codebase 🙂 
 (1/2017) This quarter I am teaching  CS122B  titled “Projects in Databases and Web Applications.” 
 (11/2016) I am looking for 2-3 PhD students to work on my current projects. If you are interested in large-scale data management (in particular, analytics and visualization), text analytics, and open source system building, feel free to contact me. 
 (11/2016) At the ACM GIS conference in San Francisco, Jianfeng will show our  Cloudberry  system to support interactive analytics and visualization on one billion tweets. Here’s the  paper . 
 (9/2016) I gave a  talk  about Cloudberry at APWeb, Suzhou, China. 
 (9/2016) This quarter I am teaching  CS222/CS122C  titled “Principles of Data Management.”
