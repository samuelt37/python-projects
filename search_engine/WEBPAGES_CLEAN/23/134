Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) provide the user the ability to quickly retarget the tool-set (compiler, simulator) to different architectures.     
Objectives (of the ADL):
   Be able to specify a wide variety of architectures (VLIWs, DSPs, etc)
   Capture information necessary to do system design space exploration 
 
(i.e. architecture-compiler exploration)
     Capture information necessary to �adapt� optimizations to different architectures.
   Support automatic generation of tool-set.
