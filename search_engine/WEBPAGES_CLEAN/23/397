measures .  J. Cardinal  and

Tech. Rep. 502,
Univ. Libre de Bruxelles, Computer Science Dept., 2003.  Worksh. Algorithm Engineering and
Experiments (ALENEX), New Orleans, 2004, pp. 112â€“119 .
 
We modify my previous data structures for dynamic closest pairs, to use
a lazy deletion mechanism, and show in experiments that the results are
an improvement on the unmodified structures.
