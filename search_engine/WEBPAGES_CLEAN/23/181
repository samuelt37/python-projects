 Summary (from  Math. Reviews  84j:51036):
We examine the problem of triangulating the
square into acute-angled triangles. By a proper triangulation we mean a
subdivision of the square and its interior into nonoverlapping triangles in
such a way that any two distinct triangles are either disjoint, have a single
vertex in common, or have one entire edge in common; and by an interior
vertex we mean a vertex (of a triangle) which lies inside the square but not
on its boundary. We begin with a proof, alternative to that of  Lindgren , of the minimality-uniqueness of eight. Then we
show there is no triangulation into nine
triangles! And finally we demonstrate that there is a triangulation of the
square into  n  acute-angled triangles for all  n  greater
than or equal to ten.

Shows how to compute a  dissection  of a polygon (that is,
vertices embedded within sides of triangles are allowed) with
no angles larger than 72 degrees, assuming all interior angles of the input
measure at least 36 degrees.
