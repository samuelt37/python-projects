  DAV Property URL Scheme - Namespace  
      �;DAV/� segment
 
  The namespace to the right of the param is a path space. Right now the path has only one entry because the property namespace is flat but in the future we will want to extend it to hierarchical.
  Thus one day a property would be referred to http://foo;DAV/a/b/c/d
