   The graphs of planar soap bubbles . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1207.3761 .   Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36 .
 
We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.
  
For the journal version, see " A
Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar lombardi drawing. ".
