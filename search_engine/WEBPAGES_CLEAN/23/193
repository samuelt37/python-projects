 Homework assignments 

Unless otherwise indicated, all problems are from [Rosen].

   Each homework will
be graded on the scale 0-2: A few selected problems from each problem
set will be graded for correctness (one point), and the remainder of
the homework will not be graded for correctness but only for effort (one
point).


  
Homework is to be submitted on the table in the front of the lecture room before the start of lecture.
 
Homework will not be accepted after lecture of the due date.

     Topics for  Quiz 7 :  Here's a list of notions from each
section in Chapter 9 divided by which notions I expect you to
know for quiz 7 and which are optional and will not be tested.

  Section 9.1.  Included: 
Graph (Directed, Undirected, Simple),  
Examples and Applications: Influence Graph, Aquaintanceship Graph, 
Collaboration Graph, Web Graph, Precedence Graph, Roadmap Graph
  Section 9.1:  Not Included:  
Multipgraph, Mixed Graph, Pseudorgraph
    Section 9.2: Included: 
Adjacent vertexes, Isolated nodes, 
Initial and Terminal vertex of an edge, Degree of a vertex, 
In-degree and Out-degree of vertex, 
Special Graphs: K_n, C_n, W_n , Q_n, 
Bipartite Graph, Bipartition, K_{m,n}
  Section 9.2: Not included: 
Pendant, Theorems 1,2,3,4 (They are good to understand but you
 won't be tested on them)
    Section 9.3: Included: 
Adjacency matrix
  Section 9.3: Not included: 
Incidence matrix, Isomorphisms between graphs.
    Section 9.4: Included: 
Path (in unidrected and directed graphs), Circuit, 
Cycle, Simple path, Connected graph, Connected Component of a graph, 
Strongly and Weakly Connected directed graphs, Strongly Connected Component
of a graph.
  Section 9.4: Not included:
Walk, trail, cut vertex, cut edge, GSCC, connection between
paths and isomorphisms, theorem 8 on counting paths (This theorem
is very interesting: You should read it, but it won't be on a test)
    Section 9.5: Whole section not included.  
However, you should have a look at what Euler and Hamiltonian paths are,
and how one of them has an easy algorithm and the other one does not.
    Section 9.6: Included:
Weighted Graph, Shortes Path, Dijkstra's Algorithm
  Section 9.6: Not included:
Travelling Salesman problem.  This is a very cool problem you should know
about, but it is not required reading for this course.
      Homework 8: Due last day of class,  Friday , June 4.
  Section 11.1: 2, 6(c,d), 8(c,d), 10, 12, 20, 21 (but familiarize yourself 
with all the other laws), 24, 32 (one way to think about this problem
is to think of the properties that must be satisfies by the bitstring
that defines this boolean function on 3 variables)
  Section 11.2: 2, 4(c,d), 8, 10, 12, 14 (conclude that | is 
functionally complete).
  Section 11.3: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (use the circuits of
exercise 10 and 11 as black boxes, i.e. just like half-adder
and full-adder cicruits are used in Figures 9 and 10), 16 (conclude
that NOR is functionally complete).
  

Solutions: 
 Sections 11.1-3 .
     A list of what material in the chapter 12 is included in the final: e them on your own but we will not test you on them. 
  Section 12.1:  Not included.  Grammars are very interesting and
    I hope you'll be curious to learn about them but you won't be tested
    on them in the final.

      Section 12.2:  Included: Def.1, which defines an FSM (a.k.a. "FSA with
                output"), and all subsequent examples of FSM's 

     Not included: Def.2, because it defines a non-standard notion
                of what it means for an FSM to recognize a
                language.Â  A standard notion is of language
                recognition by an FSA (not FSM), which is defined in
                section 12.3. In class we covered them in the other
                direction: We introduced FSA's (section 12.3) on
                Wednesday and we'll briefly discuss FSM's (section
                12.2) on Friday.  Also not included is the alternative
                "Moore FSM" model: The Moore machine is an interesting
                variant of the FSM notion but for homework and final
                will stick with the notion of FSM defined in Def 1,
                which is called "Mealy FSM". 
       Section 12.3:  Included: Defs 1,2,3,4.  Equivalence of FSA's.  Examples 1-8.
      Not included:  Non-Deterministic FSA's.
        Section 12.4: Not included.  Regular Expressions, Regular Sets, 
    and Kleene's Theorem.  Regular Expressions are very useful, and they
    appear all over Computer Science, so I hope you take this opportunity to 
    understand them, but you won't be tested on them in the final.
         Exercises from Sections 12.1-4 for practice before final (not a formal homework to be handed in)
   Section 12.2: 1(a,b), 4, 6, 8 [let the output alphabet consists
of just two symbols, namely 0 for "do not open the door right now" and
1 for "open the door"], 10, 15, 16 [you can also construct an FSA (see
section 12.3) that accepts such strings and rejects others, instead of
an FSM]

   Section 12.3: 4b, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16-20, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 39-41.

  
Solutions:  
Sections 12.1-4 .
        Solutions to tests 5,6,7  (handwritten).  
[First page of quiz 6 (ver1) is mistakenly placed at the beginning of the file:
It should be page 7, after the three versions of quiz 5.]
