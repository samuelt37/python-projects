 Abstract  
Automated reasoning is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with answering
queries and drawing new conclusions from previously stored knowledge. It includes
many areas such as theorem-proving, game playing, propositional satisability, constraint 
satisfaction, planning, scheduling, probabilistic inference and decision-making.
This dissertation is focused on reasoning in graphical frameworks such as constraint 
and belief networks, where domain knowledge is represented by a graph depicting 
variables as nodes and dependencies (e.g., propositional clauses, constraints,
probabilities, and utilities) as edges. Some reasoning tasks can be formulated as
combinatorial optimization or constraint satisfaction problems, while others can be
viewed as knowledge compilation, or inference. We approach those tasks using a
general graph-based algorithmic framework that combines a dynamic-programming
technique called variable elimination with backtracking search, and investigate the
effect of problem structure on the performance of such algorithms.
