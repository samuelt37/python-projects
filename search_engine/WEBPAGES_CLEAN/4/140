 ICS 131 Readings * Spring 2004<body>         All the articles for the quarter are nowlisted here.      Overview of the readings:   The coursetextbook, Sara Baase's  A Gift of Fire,  gives a complete, balancedoverview of many of the issues we're covering.  We recommend readingthe designated sections before reading the articles listed below, althoughyou are not required to include in your course notebook any summaries orreactions to your readings in the Baase book.    Aside from the Baase textbook, all the requiredreadings are listed below. (We may add to the list as the quarter progresses;look for the "New" icons.)  We expect you to read each listedarticle by the date specified and to include for each article an entry inyour course notebook.  See the  Course Notebook page for the detailed requirements.    As you read these articles, consider not onlythe content but also the source.  Who's the author?  Can you determinehis or her qualifications, background, or job?  What's the date of thearticle?  What kind of publication does it come from:     Newspapers (like the  Los Angeles Times or the  New York Times ); these articles will generally be easy toread but not especially deep.  Some will be straight news reporting; otherswill be opinion pieces.      Other publications for the general public(like  The New Yorker  magazine)      Professional society journals (like the  Communicationsof the ACM  or  IEEE Software ), where articles are typically writtenfor readers with a technical background by the people who have done thework described. Journal articles are typically reviewed by technical expertsbefore publication.      Reports from NGOs (non-governmental organizations)like the Electronic Frontier Foundation; these organizations often advocatea particular point of view.      Textbooks, where the author generally intendsto provide a complete, balanced treatment of a topic     This collection includes a mix of these sources;occasionally you'll even see the same topics covered from differentsources' perspectives; as you write your notebook, you can indicatethese differences in treatment.     Access to the readings:   Most of thesereadings are available on the web via the links given below.  The othersare available in the bookstore or in the ICS 131 Reading Packet availablefrom the Engineering Copy Center, as noted.    Most of the web-based readings are availablethrough the UCI Library's article databases, which means they'renot freely available to the public.  You can get access to those links withno trouble from computers on campus, but for access from home or anywhereelse, you'll need to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using freesoftware available from UCI's NACS (for Windows, Linux, or MacOS X). NACS has a page describing how to download and install the VPN software:    http://www.nacs.uci.edu/security/vpn.html    .  We have found this process to work smoothly, but you should set it upand test it immediately so that you don't run into problems too closeto the deadline.  We won't accept last-minute technical problems asan excuse for late notebooks.  Note, too, that web sites are sometimes unavailable,so it would be wise not to wait until the very last minute to read or downloadthe articles.     Exam questions about the readings:  The questions on the exams that we ask about the readings will focus oneach item's main ideas and arguments, not on small details.  If theannotations below point out some particular aspect of an article, be sureto pay attention to that aspect.      Introduction:   Baase chapter 1.      Electronic voting   (Read these by thestart of the second week, to prepare for the first writing assignment)   (Include all of the following readings in Notebook Installment #1, April20)     National Commission on Federal Election Reform,"Summary of Principal Recommendations,"   http://www.reformelections.org/data/reports/98_summary.pdf       David L.
