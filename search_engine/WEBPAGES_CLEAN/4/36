         ICS alumnus named to OC Register’s 100 Most Influential list
</strong>
              Xiaoxiang Lu '02 was recognized for the social contribution of his WeIrvine website.    
                    
ICS alumnus  Xiaoxiang Lu</strong> (M.S., Computer Science, 2002), has been recognized as one of Orange County’s 100 Most Influential Game Changers for 2016 by  The Orange County Register . Lu, who is president and co-founder of WeIrvine, an internet-based service that helps Chinese immigrants settle in the city of Irvine, was selected for the substantial social contribution his service has made to Irvine and the surrounding communities since it started in 2014. In addition to running the WeIrvine site, Lu also works as a full-time software developer.
 
  
 WeIrvine  become an online nucleolus for a recent wave of Chinese immigrants, with more than 20,000 current subscribers and about 1,000 new subscribers joining each month. The site features Chinese articles about schools, restaurants, shopping, recreation and real estate in Irvine, as well as provides many social events and trips. WeIrvine also hosts seminars on topics such as immigration and financial planning. Lu’s goal with the website was to “make the transitioning process smooth for every immigrant.”

   
The 100 most influential list aims to highlight unsung heroes and local innovators in contrast to well-known public figures. The Orange County Register selects "influencers" by having its editors revisit the top issues and stories of the past year, while also considering nominations from readers.
