  Graph Drawing 

Graph drawing can be thought of as a form of data visualization, but
unlike most other types of visualization the information to be
visualized is purely combinatorial, consisting of edges connecting a set
of vertices.  Applications of graph drawing include genealogy,  cartography 
( subway maps 
form one of the standard
examples of a graph drawing),
 sociology ,
software engineering (visualization of
connections between program modules), VLSI design, and
 visualization of hypertext links .  Typical
concerns of graph drawing algorithms are the area needed to draw a
graph, the types of edges (straight lines or bent), the number of edge
crossings for nonplanar graphs, separation of vertices and edges so they
can be distinguished visually, and preservation of properties such as
symmetry and distance.  The area has a large literature, concentrated in
the annual Graph Drawing symposia, and I won't try to link here to all
available research projects and papers on the subject, only those with some
particular historical or application interest.

    GraphML 
XML-based language for standardization of graph drawing software
input/output formats.
Other previously used graph formats include
 MALF,
edge list, node edge list, parenthesized ,
 GXL ,
 GraphXML ,
 GML ,
 LEDA.GRAPH ,
 XGMML ,
 BCG ,
 Aldebaran ,
 graph6 (g6), and sparse6 (s6) ,
so there is obviously a lot of benefit to be gained from standardization.
