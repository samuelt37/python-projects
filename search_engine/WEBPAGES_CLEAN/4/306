 A Dynamic Data Structure for Approximate Range Searching 
 Joe Simons 

 In this paper, we introduce a simple, randomized dynamic
data structure for storing multidimensional point sets, called
a quadtreap. This data structure is a randomized, balanced
variant of a quadtree data structure. In particular, it defines
a hierarchical decomposition of space into cells, which
are based on hyperrectangles of bounded aspect ratio, each
of constant combinatorial complexity. It can be viewed as a
multidimensional generalization of the treap data structure
of Seidel and Aragon. When inserted, points are assigned
random priorities, and the tree is restructured through rotations
as if the points had been inserted in priority order.
In any fixed dimension  d , we show it is possible to store a
set of  n  points in a quadtreap of space O( n ). The height
 h  of
the tree is O(log  n ) with high probability. It supports point
insertion in time O( h ). It supports point deletion in worstcase
time O( h  2 ) and expected-case time O( h ), averaged over
the points of the tree. It can answer ε-approximate spherical
range counting queries over groups and approximate nearest
neighbor queries in time O( h  + (1/ε)  d  − 1 ).
