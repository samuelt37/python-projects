 Students joining the program participate in the Bren School Honors Seminar (ICS H197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the school. ICS H197 is graded Pass/Not Pass, and the principal formal requirement is that you attend and participate. Students who are in the ICSHP are required to enroll in ICS H197 in the fall of their first year in the ICSHP. 
 In addition to ICS H197, students will be required to attend either CS 200S  or In4matx 209S.  These courses are graduate seminars that will introduce students to various research areas. Students in the ICSHP will automatically be authorized for enrollment in the graduate seminars.  Program participants are encouraged to enroll in the seminars prior to doing research, so as to facilitate networking with  faculty members.
