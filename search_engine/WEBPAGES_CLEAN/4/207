See LRM sections 2.1, 2.2 and 7.3.3

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
   A function can only have input parameters, so the mode (direction)
is not specified.
 function BOOL_TO_SL(X : boolean)
              return std_ulogic is
begin
  if X then
    return '1';
  else
    return '0';
  end if;
end BOOL_TO_SL;
  
   
  

 
   A function may declare local variables. These do not retain their
values between successive calls, but are re-initialised each time.
Array-type parameters may be unconstrained:
 function PARITY (X : std_ulogic_vector)
                 return std_ulogic is
  variable TMP : std_ulogic := '0';
begin
  for J in X'range loop
    TMP := TMP xor X(J);
  end loop; -- works for any size X
  return TMP;
end PARITY;
  
   
  

 
   A function may contain any sequential statement except  signal
assignment  and  wait . 
 A type-conversion function may be called in a port map, to match
port type to signal type. 
   If a function is defined in a package, its body (the
algorithm part) must be placed in the package body: 
package REF_PACK is
  function PARITY (X : bit_vector)
                   return bit;
end REF_PACK;

package body REF_PACK is
  function PARITY (X : bit_vector)
                   return bit is  
  begin
    -- function code
  end PARITY;
end REF_PACK;
  
   
  

 
   A function is called as an expression, in either a concurrent or
sequential statement:
 
architecture  FUNCTIONS  of PAR is
begin
  PARITY_BYTE FUNCTIONS;
  
   
  

 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

User-defined  functions  are usually supported for synthesis, providing
they act on suitable data types. Different synthesis tools recognise
various different type conversion and resolution  functions . Most accept
those deined in the  std_logic_1164  package.
 
        Whats New in '93       

In  VHDL -93,  functions  may be declared as  pure  or  impure . A
 pure  function is the default, and is compatible with  VHDL -87. The
value returned by an  impure  function can depend on items other
than just its input parameters (e.g.shared variables).
  
In  VHDL -93, the keyword  end  may be followed by the keyword
 function  for clarity and consistancy.
