 System Development Experience 

   
 11/2005 - Present: Software Expert Consultant for Space and Weapons
Systems Center in San Diego for the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) project     6/2000 - present: Chief Architect and Systems Programmer     
Used Java to develop   ZEN , a
real-time Java ORB, at UC Irvine.  Alpha released June 2002.
   11/2001 - 1/2002: Software Consultant   
Designed and implemented an intelligent news browser for cell phones
(in C under QUALCOMM BREW SDK) for Adaptive Info. Won award for Best
Content/Most Useful from Qualcomm BREW 2002 Developers Conference.
   6/1997 - 9/1997: Chief Architect and Systems Programmer   
Used C++ and Java to develop Syskill and Webert, a client-server intelligent search engine for the world wide web. Used as the basis for the key product for  Prof. Mike Pazzani �s startup company.
   6/1996 - 9/1996: Chief Architect and Project Manager   
Used C++ to develop the framework for an extensible, portable compiler to be used for research on optimizing compilers, with  Prof. Alex Nicolau  and  Prof. Nikil Dutt .
   6/2000 - 7/2000: Software Consultant   
Used C to build a Unix-based custom client-server communication
framework for a critical product (Pick To Light Warehouse System) of Optum Corp. in Costa Mesa, CA. When
their programmers were unable to build it, I was consulted to design,
implement, test, and deliver it in one week, so that they were able to
deliver their product on time.
   6/1981 - 6/1988: Designed and implemented Adash, the Ada shell,
and Arcturus, an interactive interpreter-based programming environment
for Ada.
 
Developed in C on Unix, this system demonstrated concepts developed
during graduate school research and served as proof of principle for
dissertation.
   6/1981 - 6/2001: co-founded Irvine Compiler Corporation.
 
Designed and implemented compilers and related software tools for
Ada, C, C++, Pascal.
