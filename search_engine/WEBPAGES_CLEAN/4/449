   Approximating center points with iterated Radon points .

 S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  6 (3): 357–377, 1996 .
 
Given a collection of  n  sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
 linear programming ,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both  n  and  d.

Uses geometric optimization techniques to find, among  n  weighted values,
the  k  to drop so as to maximize the weighted average of the remaining values.
The feasibility test for the corresponding decision problem involves
 k -sets in a dual line arrangement.

    Fast hierarchical
clustering and other applications of dynamic closest pairs . 
D. Eppstein.  
 9th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
San Francisco, 1998, pp. 619–628 .  arXiv:cs.DS/9912014 .   J. Experimental
Algorithmics  5 (1): 1–23, 2000 .
 
This paper shows how to use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " for some non-geometric problems including
hierarchical clustering,
 greedy matching ,
and  TSP heuristics .
Experiments show variants of my data structures to be faster than
previously used heuristics.

    Regression depth and center points .  N. Amenta ,
 M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, and
 S.-H. Teng .  arXiv:cs.CG/9809037 .   3rd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Brown Univ., 1998.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  23 (3): 305–323, 2000 .
 
We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
 regression depth  at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

    Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/9912013 .  
 16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321 .  Disc. Comp. Geom.  28 (1): 1–17, 2002.
 
We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".

    Computing the depth of a flat .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0009024 .  
 12th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Washington, 2001, pp. 700–701 .
 
We compute the  regression depth  of a k-flat
in a set of n d-dimensional
points, in time O(n d-2 ), an order of magnitude faster than
the best known algorithms for computing the depth of a point or of a
hyperplane.
The results from this conference paper have been merged into the full

Defines  quasiconvex programming , a form of generalized linear
programming in which one seeks the point minimizing the pointwise
maximum of a collection of quasiconvex functions.
Surveys algorithms for solving quasiconvex programs either numerically
or via generalizations of the dual simplex method from linear
programming, and describe varied applications of this geometric
optimization technique in meshing, scientific computation, information
visualization, automated algorithm analysis, and robust statistics.

Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional  hyperbolic
space .  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.
  
    Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0604034 .  18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(3): Article 29, 2009 .
 
We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.
