" Approaches to Specification-Based Testing " ,

 Proceedings of the Third ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Software Testing,
Analysis and Verification, 
pages 86-96, Keywest, December 1989.

  Abstract  

Current software testing practices focus, almost exclusively, on the 
implementation, despite widely acknowledged benefits of testing based 
on software specifications. We propose approaches to specification-based 
testing by extending a wide variety of implementation-based testing
techniques to be applicable to formal specification languages. We 
demonstrate these approaches for the Anna and Larch specification languages.
