  Rethinking Circuits When Interconnect Dominates  
      DEVICE: Choose better interconnect
 
  Copper, low temperature interconnect
       CAD: Choose better interconnect topology, sizes
 
  Minimize path from driver gate to each receiver gate
  e.g., A-tree algorithm yields about 12% reduction in delay
    Select wire sizes to minimize net delays
  e.g., upto 35% reduction in delay by optimal sizing algorithms
         CKT: Use more signal repeaters in block-level designs
 
  longest interconnect=2000 mu for 350nm process 
       u-ARCH: A storage element no longer defines a clock boundary
 
  Multiple storage elements in a single clock
  Multiple state transitions in a clock period
  Storage-controlled routing
  Reduced marginal cost of logic
