  Limits: Web Servers  
        Unprincipled
 

      Not able to specifically identify resources at risk within a server (�medical records�)
  Not responsible for own security; varies by OS
  Not careful in logging anomalies or for rollback
         Principal identification scattered
 

      E.g. SSL client-auth info cannot pass up to HTTP
  Lower-layer IP source or DNS lookup spoofable
         Inflexible policies
 

      Typically limited to user-and-password configurations
