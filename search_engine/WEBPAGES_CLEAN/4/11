   Data Set Information:  
 This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda &amp; Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.  Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.  This is an exceedingly simple domain.  This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,   spchadwick  '@'  espeedaz.net  ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.   

   Attribute Information:  
    1. sepal length in cm    2. sepal width in cm    3. petal length in cm    4. petal width in cm    5. class:        -- Iris Setosa       -- Iris Versicolour       -- Iris Virginica
