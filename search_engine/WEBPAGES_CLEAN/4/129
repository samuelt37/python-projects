3.26.3 GetFormat 
 

 
    
unsigned int GetFormat() const
    
Return the file format associated with an output oemolstream.  The set
of unsigned integer values valid for this property are defined by the
OEFormat namespace.  By default, when writing to standard out
(std::cout), the associated file format is OEFormat::SMILES.  The
file format property of an output oemolstream may be set using the
oemolostream::SetFormat method.  Note that the file format property is
also set automatically by oemolostream::open based upon the file
extension of the specified filename.
