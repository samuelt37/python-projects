  Scent         Links 
should "smell" like what the user wants.           confidence 
before clicking the link       feeling 
closer to the answer afterwards       Pragmatic 
measure of information scent   (Spool et al., 1998)   
    1. Ask users before they click   
       a) What they 
thought they would get          
b) How confident they were (on a -2 to +2 scale)       2. 
Ask users after they click          
c) whether they were closer to the search goal (on a -2 to +2 scale)   
       d) add the results 
from (b) and (c)          
e) add the results from (d) cumulatively       The score of (e) is highly correlated with ultimate success. It should increase monotonously.   
 
   Users are pretty good in predicting whether or not they came closer to their goal. 
They are notorously bad 
in predicting how far they are still away though.
