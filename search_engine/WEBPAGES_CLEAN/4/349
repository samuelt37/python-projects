 Abstract  
Path-consistency algorithms, which are polynomial for
discrete problems, are exponential when applied to
problems involving quantitative temporal information.
The source of complexity stems from specifying relationships 
between pairs of time points as disjunction of
intervals. We propose a polynomial algorithm, called
ULT, that approximates path-consistency in Temporal
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (TCSPs). We compare 
ULT empirically to path-consistency and directional 
path-consistency algorithms. When used as a
preprocessing to backtracking, ULT is shown to be 10
times more effective then either DPC or PC-2.
