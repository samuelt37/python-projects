I am a first year graduate student associated with the Center for Computer Embedded Systems and the Architectures and Compilers for Embedded Systems groups at UCI. Before joining UCI, I worked as a research scientist at ISRO Satellite Centre,  Indian Space Research Organization , Bangalore. My research interests are in the areas of cross-layer resilient MPSoC design, digital signal processing, autonomous distributed and parallel computing systems, and sensor networks. I work with  Prof. Dutt ,  Prof. Nicolau , and  Prof. Gupta  as part of the   Variability Expedition  and with   Prof. Nalini Venkatasubramanian  and  Prof. Sharad Mehrotra  as part of the  Cypress Project .
