    Internet Packet Filter Management and Rectangle Geometry .
D. Eppstein and S. Muthukrishnan
use orthogonal range searching techniques for finding rules that match
incoming packets, and detecting rule conflicts.
 
    Spatial
modelling by Delaunay networks .  Terje Midtbï¿½ explains applications
of Voronoi diagrams to "subjects such as determination of areas covered
by a mobile telephone transmitter, determination of high-water marks in
rivers, determination of noise zones along roads, drawing voltage maps,
and other, more conventional cartographic tasks."
 
    The WISE
wireless system engineering tool  uses computational geometry
techniques developed by Steve Fortune of Bell Labs as part of a package
for predicting signal propagation of radio links inside buildings.
More information on the geometric problems arising here can be found
in Steve's paper "A beam tracing algorithm for prediction of indoor
radio propagation", in the 1st ACM Worksh. on Applied Computational Geometry.
