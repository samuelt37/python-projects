    New Ideas Talk at ASE 2014 


  
   
    Date: 06 Oct 2014
   
  
   ASE 2014 was personally a great experience! I presented an early research idea and got some great feedback for it! I was able to meet some leading thinkers in the area of software research, who have inspired my own research. Overall, it turned out to be a great learning experience. 

 The paper and the slides of my talk can be found  here  and  here  respectively; along with a vimeo of my talk: 


  Discriminating Influences among Instructions in a Dynamic Slice  from  vpalepu  on  Vimeo . 

  Update:</strong> The slides to the talk can now be accessed on SpeakerDeck.
