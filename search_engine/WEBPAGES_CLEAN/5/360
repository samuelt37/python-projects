Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes for Euclidean TSP and Other
Geometric Problems 
Joseph Wang, ICS, UC Irvine 

 Arora presents a polynomial time approximation scheme for
Euclidean TSP in  R  2  that finds a
(1+epsilon)-approximation tour in time  
n  O(1/epsilon) . The scheme can be extended to higher
dimensions and other Euclidean problems in which the objective
function is a sum of edge lengths.
