   General
Educational
Aims:     This class is
concerned with "user aspects" of privacy in electronic environments,
specifically web sites and mobile computing. It will focus on
empirically determined factors that influence individuals'
privacy-related decisions and actions (e.g., one's willingness to
disclose personal data to websites), and on current approaches to help
users safeguard their privacy online. We will study research articles
from different disciplines, such as information systems,     human-computer
interaction,     marketing research,
public policy, law, and the information and computer sciences.   

   Requirements :
Graduate level, or permission of instructor. The course is very
research-oriented.

the readings, and conduct a small research project.
