 Shu Kong (Aimery)  


 I am a computer science PhD  student  candidate at  Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences ,  UC Irvine . I work at the  Computational Vision Group  where I am advised by  Prof. Charless Fowlkes  and working closely with Prof.  Deva Ramanan . I am also collaborating with Prof.  Olivier Cinquin  and Prof.  Surangi Punyasena . 
I am broadly interested in computer vision, machine learning and their applications.
Currently, I'm working on some theory and applications of deep convolutional neural networks, e.g. image aesthetics, bioimage computing, fine-grained classification, keypoint detection, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, etc.
An overview of my research can be found in the one-page  research statement .

  I'm very slow in responding to messages from all kinds of social media. I'm sort of anti-social-media. So email should be the best way to reach me.
 
 
 

 
 
  I will get involved in cross-discipline research actively, like  Big Data Image Processing and Analysis (Big DIPA).
