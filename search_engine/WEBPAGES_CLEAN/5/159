  Replicators : B0235/S0 

  B0235/S0 
has a diagonal replicator that repeats with period 4, moving
diagonally at speed c/2. 

     

 The same rule also has a small 7c/14 orthogonal replicator: 

     

 The orthogonal replicator can pull a dot behind it at 14c/28,
making the largest known spaceship with only three live cells in any rule:
