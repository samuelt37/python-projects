    On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms . 
D. Eppstein.  
 SIGACT News  18 (3): 38–40, 1987 .
 
A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
 alphametic )
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

Gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of mutations needed
to transform one input string into another, in a general model
in which substrings may be inserted or deleted at a cost depending
nonlinearly on the substring length.  The time bound

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between  n 2   and  n 3  
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

    Finding the  k  smallest spanning trees .

(special issue for 2nd Scand. Worksh. Algorithm Theory).
 
By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O( k )
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving  m  or  n 
to one involving min( m,   k ) or min( n,   k )
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the  k  smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order ( k +1) Voronoi diagrams.

    Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity . 
D. Eppstein. 
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.   J. Graph Th.  17: 409–416, 1993 .
 
It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

    Dynamic three-dimensional linear programming .

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
 linear programming 
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in " Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers ",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
  
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
 formal
concept analysis . If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

 SIAM J. Computing  28 (2): 652–673, 1998 .
 
This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the  k  shortest in the graph, where  k  is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
  
The  k  shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
 k  shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
" The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The

We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation

pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

    Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1870 .  21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms , Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.
 
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n ε -approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n 1 − ε  for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

    Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1866 .   J. Computational Geometry  2 (1): 144–182, 2011 .
 
Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a  Manhattan orbifold  and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L 1  plane.

We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns

    Densities of minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1009.5633 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  17(1), Paper R136, 2010 .
 
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
 c ( n  +  o ( n ); for instance, for
planar graphs,  c  = 3. We call  c  the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ω ω , and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

    Diamond-kite meshes: adaptive quadrilateral meshing and orthogonal circle packing .

We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar Lombardi drawing . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1206.6142 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 126–137 .  
We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1207.3761 .   Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry , Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36 .
 
We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1302.5967 .   Order  31 (1): 81–99, 2014 .
 Erratum (with V. Wiechert) .
 
We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial
order should have a pair of items that are nearly equally likely to
appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

a grid graph from which a given number of vertices have been deleted,
and study several related problems.

We show how to represent a learning space by a small family of learning
sequences, orderings of the items in a learning sequence that are
consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge
states and the efficient assessment of the state of knowledge of a human
learner.

In another chapter of the same book we used learning sequences to
represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of
a human learning. In this chapter we show how to use the same data
structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger
learning space (an important subroutine in knowledge assessment) and to
modify a learning space to more accurately model students.

    Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity .

Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1502.05334 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  20 (2): 323–346, 2016 .
 
We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.
  
    Treetopes and their graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1510.03152 .   27th ACM-SIAM

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Theory (SWAT 2016) , Reykjavik, Iceland.  Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) 53, pp. 8.1–8.12 .
 
A cuckoo filter is an approximate set data structure that can be used in
place of a Bloom filter, but with several practical advantages: it uses
less space, has better locality of reference, and can handle element
deletions. We provide the first theoretical analysis of a simplified
variation of cuckoo filters, showing that these advantages can be
guaranteed to hold theoretically and not just experimentally.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1607.02184 .  Proc. 28th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry , Vancouver, BC,
Canada, 2016.  
We show how to find a system of disjoint balls with given centers,
maximizing the sum of radius of the balls. Our algorithm takes cubic
time in arbitrary metric spaces and can be sped up to subquadratic time
in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension.
