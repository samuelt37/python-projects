  Gestalt Laws        Gestalt 
laws describe regularities of human perception (but do not explain them!)     

   Proximity : 
objects that are close to each other tend to be seen as a group                  Make
      sure that objects that belong to the same context are viewed as a group                                                                                                 
   Similarity : 
objects of the same shape or color are seen as belonging together            
      
   Closure : 
Missing parts of an object are filled in to complete it, so that it appears as 
a whole            



  Continuity : 
lines tend to be seen as continuous, even if they are interrupted                                   
   Symmetry : 
  regions bounded by symmetrical borders tend to be perceived as coherent figures 
              

   Common fate:  items appear as belonging together if, e.g.,   they   move in sync
