					 Aubrey Slaughter is a first-year Ph.D. student in the EVOKE Lab who studies hacktivism, virtual communities, and ephemeral data. His previous work centered around hactivistic efforts of the online collective known as  Anonymous  during Libya’s recent revolution. His other projects include budget warbooking, amateur experimental neuroscience, and video games. A Texas native, Aubrey plans to move to the Internet as soon as they have that figured out.
