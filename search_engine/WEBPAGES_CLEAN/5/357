           Title  Recent Advances in Process-driven Intranets and Extranets for Concurrent Engineering     Publication Type  Conference Proceedings     Year of Publication  1998     Authors   Scacchi, W.      Conference Name  IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics     Volume  3     Pagination  2631-2634     Date Published  Oct. 11-14     Conference Location  San Diego, CA     Keywords   Business communication ,  Computational engineering processes ,  Concurrent engineering ,  Distributed development and runtime support environment ,  Intranets ,  Organizational process architecture ,  Process-driven extranets ,  Process-driven intranets ,  Reusable framework ,  Software components      Abstract   Focuses on addressing computational engineering processes as software components for concurrent engineering of complex systems. These components can be configured into an organizational process architecture that serves as a reusable framework for developing a CE information infrastructure. Process-driven intranets then serve as a distributed development and runtime support environment for the framework.
