22.1 Introduction 
 

 
To fully understand a predicate functor requires an understanding of
several other concepts not unique to C++.  Predicate functors incorporate
the concepts of function pointers, call-backs, functions with "state", and
C++ operators.  Fortunately, most programmers are already familiar with
these concepts from other languages, and the transition to predicate
functors is often more syntactic candy than revolutionary.
