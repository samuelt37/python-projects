School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Nanyang Technological University. 2005.    is generated from landsat multi-spectral scanner image data. It has 36 dimensions, 4435 training samples and 2000 testing samples belonging to 6 classes. Optdigits. This is a 60-dimensional data set on  optical   recognition  of 10 handwritten digits. It has separate training and testing sets with 3823 and 1797 samples, respectively. Vehicle. This data set involves classification of a given       Claudio Gentile.  A New Approximate Maximal Margin Classification Algorithm . NIPS. 2000.    The 214 Approximate Maximal Margin Classification real-world datasets are well-known  Optical  Character  Recognition  (OCR) benchmarks. On these datasets we followed the experimental setting described by Cortes and Vapnik (1995), Freund and Schapire (1999), Li and Long       Stephen D. Bay.  Nearest neighbor classification from multiple feature subsets . Intell. Data Anal, 3. 1999.    or disjoint) in combination with the CNN classifier to edit and reduce the prototypes. He also reported improvements (on five domains from the UCI repository and one  optical  character  recognition  dataset) over the baseline NN classifier if the training sets were sufficiently small and thus able to generate diverse classifiers. It is important to note that both of Alpaydin's and Skalak's work differ       Ethem Alpaydin.  Combined 5 x 2 cv F Test for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms .

ODR, DIGIT are two datasets on  optical  handwritten digit  recognition  and PEN is on pen-based handwritten digit recognition. These three datasets are available from the author. The other datasets are from the UCI repository       Ayhan Demiriz and Kristin P. Bennett and John Shawe and I. Nouretdinov V..  Linear Programming Boosting via Column Generation .

USPS and Optdigits are  optical  character  recognition  datasets. USPS has 256 dimensions without missing values. Out of 7291 original training points, we use 1822 points as training data and the other 5469 as validation data. There are 2007 test points.       Erick Cant�-Paz and Chandrika Kamath.  Using Evolutionary Algorithms to Induce Oblique Decision Trees . Center for Applied Scientific Computing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.    we experimented with the  optical  digit  recognition  data set, which is also available at UCI's ML repository. This data set has 3823 instances in a training set and 1797 in a testing set; each instance is described by 64 numeric attributes. The objective is
