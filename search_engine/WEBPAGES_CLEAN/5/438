Constraining UML

  

       Identify UML meta classes semantically  similar to major architectural constructs

 

      operation, message, port

  component, connector, architecture

         Define stereotypes and apply them to meta class instances 

 

      use stereotypes to model structural aspects of an architecture

         Describe semantics using UML diagrams

 

      sequence, statechart, collaboration, activity       --&gt;
