 Analysis of Algorithms<body>
 CS 263, Spring 2014: Analysis of Algorithms 

 This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, 3:00 - 3:50 in Bren 1429.
Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, graded during the
class period on which they are due, and a final exam. Group work on
homeworks is permitted and encouraged. Knowledge of a previous course in
the design and analysis of algorithms (such as the CS 161 or CS 260
courses taught at UCI) is expected, but otherwise all CS graduate
students are welcome. 

 The textbook for this course will
be   Approximation
Algorithms  , by Vijay Vazirani.
The tentative schedule of topics is to go through the chapters of this book at a rate of approximately one chapter per lecture. 

 Tentative schedule: 
  Week 1: Chapters 1-2 (combinatorial algorithms). Homework, due in class Friday, Jan 16: Exercises 1.1, 1.3, 2.8, 2.14. 
 Week 2: Chapters 3-5 (combinatorial algorithms). Homework, due in class Friday, Jan 23: Exercises 3.2, 3.5, 4.7, 5.1 
 Week 3: Holiday Monday. Chapters 6-7 (combinatorial algorithms). 
 Week 4: Chapters 8-10 (approximation schemes). Homework, due in
  class Friday, Jan 30: (1) Exercise 3
  of  this blog post .
  (2) Find a counterexample to the "clearly" equality on page 56,
  mentioned in the footnote of the blog post. (3,4) Exercises 6.1, 7.1.
  Week 5: Chapters 11-12 (geometric approximation; linear
  programming
  duality);  minimax 
  and  Yao's
  principle . Homework, due in class Friday, Feb 6: 8.1, 8.3, 9.9,
  10.2 
 Week 6: Chapters 13-15 (LP-based approximation for set
  cover;  method
  of conditional expectations  as
  an  explanation
  for greedy set cover ). Homework, due in
  class Friday, Feb 13: 11.3, 12.3, 12.7; Problem 4: use Yao's principle
  and
  the  decision
  tree lower bound for comparison sorting  to prove that every
  randomized comparison-based sorting algorithm must use
  Ω(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. (Hint: in a
  binary tree with k leaves, the average distance to a leaf is at least
  log 2 k.) 
 Week 7: Holiday Monday. Chapters 16 &amp; 26 (Max sat and semidefinite
  programming). Homework, due in class Friday, Feb 20: 14.4, 14.5, 15.3,
  15.5. 
 Week 8: Chapters 27-29 (lattices, counting, and
  inapproximability). Homework, due in class Friday, Feb 27: 16.1,
  16.7, 26.5, 26.13 
 Week 9: Additional topics: volume of convex bodies; unique
  games. Homework, due in class Friday, Mar 8: 27.6, 28.6, 28.8, 29.1. 
 Week 10: No class.
