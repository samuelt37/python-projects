 Abstract  
In this paper we study the properties of the class of head-cycle-free
extended disjunctive logic programs (HEDLPs), which includes, as a
special case, all nondisjunctive extended logic programs. We show that
any propositional HEDLP can be mapped in polynomial time into a
propositional theory such that each model of the latter corresponds
to an answer set, as defined by stable model semantics, of the former.
Using this mapping, we show that many queries over HEDLPs can be
determined by solving propositional satisfiability problems.
Our mapping has several important implications: It establishes
the NP-completeness of this class of disjunctive logic programs; it
allows existing algorithms and tractable subsets for the satisfiability
problem to be used in logic programming; it facilitates evaluation of
the expressive power of disjunctive logic programs; and it leads to the
discovery of useful similarities between stable model semantics and
Clark's predicate completion.
