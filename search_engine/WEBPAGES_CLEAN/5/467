 Reduced Cost Ordering:<body>

  Reduced Cost Ordering:Postprocessor for FOCL  
      Input
 
  n  sets of clauses (one per class)
  classified examples (distinct from examples used to create clauses)
  Cost matrix
       Output
 
  Ordered decision list using subset of the clauses
  default rule
       Approach: 
     
1. Let Pool = an unordered set of rules learned on training set
   
2. Initialize Rules to a default (Least Expected Cost Class)
  
3. Add single rule (and new default) to Rules that most 
  
   lowers misclassification cost on ordering set.
  
4. Repeat until addition wouldnï¿½t lower misclassification cost.
