 See LRM sections 8.2 and 9.4

          Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The assert statement tests the boolean condition. If this is false,
it outputs a message containing the reopirt string to the simulator screen:
 assert (J /= C) report "J = C" severity note;
  
    
  

 
    The severity level may be defined as  note, warning, error  or  failure 
Level  failure  normally aborts the simulation.
 assert not OVERFLOW) report "Accumulator overflowed" severity failure;
  
    
  

 
    If the message clause is ommited, a default message is output.
The severity level and the name of the design unit containing the relevant assert
statement may also be output 
    
  

 
    If the severity clause is ommited, the default level is  error.  
    
  

 
    A  concurrent  statement monitors the boolean condition continuously 
    
  

 
    An unconditional message can be output by using the literal  false :
 procedure PUT
	(signal STACK  : inout T_STACK;
	signal POINTER : inout T_POINT;
	signal ITEM    : in    T_DATA) is
begin
	if (POINTER &lt; 5) then
		STACK(POINTER) &lt;= ITEM;
		POINTER &lt;= POINTER + 1;
	else
		assert false report "Stack overflow" severity error;
	end if;
end PUT;
  
    
  

 
    As well as functional errors, timing errors can be reported via  assert :
 CHECK_SETUP: process (CLK, D)
begin
	if (CLK'event and CLK = '1') then
		assert D'stable(SETUP_TIME) report "Setup Violation..." severity warning;
	end if;
end process CHECK_SETUP;
  
    

 
         Synthesis Issues        

Assert statements are ignored by logic synthesis tools.
  

 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, the  assert  statement may have an option label.
  
A concurrent  assert  statement may be run as a
postponed  process 
  
 VHDL -93 allows  report  to be used on it's own as a sequential statement,
giving the same functionality as  assert false , except that the default
severity is  note 
  
MSG1: report "Starting test sequence" severity note;
