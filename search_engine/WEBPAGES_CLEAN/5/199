 Gliders and Wolfram's Classification<body>
      Most Wanted  

      The following are cellular automata rules ( in standard semitotalistic rule notation )
    which "seem like" they should have moving patterns (or for
    which it would be especially interesting to find such
    patterns), but for which my search software has been
    unsuccessful:  

        B35/S234578 
        "land rush"  

         Chaotic growth evolves into stable patchwork of
        horizontally and vertically plowed regions. Has various
        small oscillators including Life's clock, and arbitrarily
        high period oscillators via a simulation of the
        one-dimensional B01/S02 automaton (e.g. between two
        out-of-phase rows of farmland). Ok, maybe there's no reason
        for it to have gliders but it's one of the more interesting
        rules I've seen. The stable regions can have small
        oscillators in them, maybe there are gliders and more
        complicated patterns if we're given an initial background
        of farmland rather than blank space. 
          B345/S5 
        "longlife"  

         Complicated long-lived oscillating patterns of
        alternating rows seem to be trapped inside a bounding
        diamond. Are they really unable to grow? 
          B01345/S01234  

         Most random initial configurations quickly decay into
        small oscillating blobs, mostly with period two. If the
        initial density is around 59%, the phase ambiguity leads to
        much larger intertwined black and white blobs with stable
        boundaries edged by higher period oscillators. 
          B017/S1  

         Random fields at 50% turn into grids of 4c/8 and 7c/14
        replicators blocked between small black blobs. Random
        fields at 25% turn into blobby unmoving mixtures of black
        and white areas. Very sparse random fields form grids of
        replicators again, gradually accumulating blobs where the
        replicators interact until all replicators are blocked
        between pairs of blobs. Except for the replicators, random
        patterns become static very quickly. 
          B02/S  

         Random fields at 25% turn into long-lasting blobs which
        decay into small low-period oscillators. Higher density
        random fields form a single large blob. 
          B3/S23456  

         An interesting mixture of slow chaotic accretion and
        horizontal and vertical shoots. When a chaotic blob meets a
        shoot, it can occasionally form a "runner" that grows along
        the shoot; when the runner catches up to the head of the
        shoot it starts a new blob of chaos. Also supports a few
        small oscillators including Life's clock. Very similar to
        B3/S012345678 "Life without death" which of course has no
        spaceships. 
          B3/S45678  

         A very slowly growing black blob filled with intricate
        tree-like patterns of white dots. Has small oscillators of
        periods 3, 5, 6, 8, and 22.  Searched unsuccessfully with gfind
        to level L128. 
          B34/S03456  

         One of the rules studied by Wolfram. An expanding
        octagonal region filled with stable junk. Has many small p2
        and p4 oscillators. 
          B345/S456  

         Extremely slowly growing black diamonds mostly filled
        with a stable bacterial matrix but with some long-term
        chaotic fluctuations. One of two narrow connections between
        the B35xx/S45xx and B34xx/S4xx blocks of rules. 
          B345/S4567  

         Stable black diamonds filled with white dots. 
          B34567/S0678  

         Slowly growing mazes. Symmetric under black/white
        reversal. 
          B34567/S348  

         The only B3xx/S348 rule without known spaceships.
        Slightly rounded diamond-shaped growing chaos. 
          B345678/S15678  

         Stable filled octagons. 
          B345678/S014578  

         Dense expanding chaos. The only B3xx/S014578 rule for
        which no gliders are known. 
          B345678/S458  

         Dense chaos fills an expanding diamond-shaped
        region. 
          B345678/S47  
        and  B345678/S478  

         Slowly expanding chaos. 
          B348/S4  

         Quickly decays to isolated 4-cell p2 oscillators. 
          B34678/S23578  

         Expanding chaos. 
          B3478/S24568  

         Expanding chaos. 
          B35/S46  

         Has p2 and p4 oscillators, but most patterns quickly
        decay to nothing. One of two narrow connections between the
        B35xx/S45xx and B34xx/S4xx blocks of rules. 
          B36/S1567  

         Quickly stabilizes to isolated domino still lifes and
        low-period oscillators. Has arbitrarily high-period
        oscillators formed out of 2x2 blocks of cells. 
          Even more than gliders for these rules, I would like a
    mathematical proof that certain rules (e.g. rules with B23,
    with B3 and none of S0-S5, or with all of B3/S34567) are unable
    to support gliders.
