   The term paper is an original,
  in-depth exploration of some current topic in software engineering. The paper
  must be new for this class, not a revised paper written for some other class.
  This paper may be largely survey in nature. Substantial latitude will be
  allowed in choosing the topic, but all topics must be software-related and
  approved in advance by the instructor. �
   Each student will present in class a 5-minute overview of their paper 
         
    Abstract Due During
  Week 6 (November 3-7) via email (attachment or Plain Text)    
         
   The �abstract� assignment
  consists of the following items in a 1-page single-spaced document (Word, PDF,
  or Plain Text). 
     �         
     Title reflecting the theme of your term paper 
     �         
     You name, email, student id, and date 
     �         
     1 paragraph 50-200 words 
     �         
     3 references � i.e. three references that
  provide a context for the theme of the term paper. 1 reference may be a paper
  that was selected for class lecture and 1 reference may be a Web site. But,
  at least 1 reference (if not all 3) are papers you have found (e.g. using the
  resources on the  Links 
  page). 
         
    Short Presentation
  During Week 10 (December 1 and 3)    
       
   The short presentation will
  consist of the following slides (or some reasonable variation of the
  following) 
     �         
     Title slide with title, your name, email, and
  whatever information you deem appropriate 
     �         
     Motivation�why you in particular wanted to
  investigate this area 
     �         
     2-3 slides explaining the content of your
  survey�usually content would include a definition or description of the area,
  common problems in the area, and classification of the seminal and other
  research papers you found in the area and what their accomplishments were.
  You might use a table to organize your classification. 
     �         
     Conclusions�including e.g. what has been
  achieved overall and what remains to be done in the field. 
   You may choose to include your
  opinion on the field even if your opinion is �this field is as dead as Latin
  because �� 
         
    Written Document Due
  by   5
   p.m.   December 12    
       
   The paper will be basically a
  survey of research, not a new research contribution. However, survey papers
  often have novel contribution in the way the author organizes or classifies
  papers. �  For the purposes of this
  class, completeness is more important than originality of the classification.
   Of course, the paper has to be originally written ; plagiarism results
  in a failed assignment and disciplinary action.  
       
   The paper itself should be 20-30
  pages double-spaced (1.25� margins,  Times style font size 12  or  Arial/ Tahoma style font size 10). You may exceed the page
  length to provide references separately, e.g. you might have 28 pages of text
  followed by 3 pages of references. In any case you should not have more than
  33 pages.
