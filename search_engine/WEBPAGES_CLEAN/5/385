   Data Set Information:  
 This dataset is an addition to the dataset at   [Web Link]        We collected more dataset to improve the accuracy of our HAR algorithms applied in        a Social connectedness experiment in the domain of Ambient Assisted Living.        The dataset was collected from the in-built accelerometer and gyroscope of a        smartphone worn around the waist of participants. See waist_mounted_phone.PNG.       The data was collected from 30 participants within the age group of 22-79 years.        Each activity (standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs) was        performed for 60secs and the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity  were        collected at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

   Attribute Information:  
 For each record in the dataset it is provided:     - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration).       Filenames: final_acc_train.txt, final_acc_test.txt    - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.       Filenames: final_gyro_train.txt, final_gyro_test.txt    - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables       (extracted from the triaxial data)       Filenames: final_X_train.txt, final_X_test.txt      For more information about the features extracted see (features.txt and features_info.txt)    - The corresponding activity labels. Filenames: final_y_train.txt and final_y_test.txt.
