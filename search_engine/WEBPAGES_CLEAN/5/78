   Computing the discrepancy .  
D. P. Dobkin  and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 47â€“52. 
 
Measures how well a sample of points from a set works as a discrete
approximation to the continuous measure of shapes in the set,
using algorithms based on Overmars and van Leeuwen's dynamic convex hull
data structure.
Some versions of the problem also involve subroutines
for finding the deepest point in an arrangement of quadrants or orthants.
  
This paper was merged with results of Mitchell to form the journal version,
" Computing the discrepancy with applications
to supersampling patterns ".
