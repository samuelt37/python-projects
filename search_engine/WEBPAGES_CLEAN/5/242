						     VID case studies were based around the use of Electronic Medical Record systems.  
 Lab members  Matthew Bietz ,  Cory Knobel , and  Katie Pine  presented a tutorial on  Values in Design for Collaborative Systems  at the  2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems  in San Diego. In the tutorial we provided an introduction to human-centered computing, explored the Values in Design concept, and then worked through a series of case-based design exercises focused on understanding stakeholders, eliciting values, and designing from a particular value standpoint. The case examples were drawn from Katie Pine’s  examination of the use of Electronic Medical Record systems in labor and delivery rooms . Slides from the presentation are  available on SlideShare .
