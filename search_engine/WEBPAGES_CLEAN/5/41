   Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0304018 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006 .
 
We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 
  
The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

Studies the resilience of distributed computation networks against
adversarial and random fault models; shows that, in both models,
certain networks can withstand constant fault probabilities and
still contain a large subnetwork with similar expansion to the original.

We give a linear time algorithm for pruning a node-weighted tree to maximize
the average node weight of the pruned subtree; this problem was
previously studied under the less obvious name "The Fractional
Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem on Trees".

    Drawings of planar graphs with few slopes and segments.   V. Dujmović ,

and
 D. R. Wood .  arXiv:math.CO/0606450 .   Comp.
Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  38: 194–212, 2007. 
 
We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).
  
    Cubic partial cubes from simplicial arrangements.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0510263 .   Electronic
J. Combinatorics  13(1) #R79, 2006 .
 
We show how to construct a cubic partial cube from any simplicial
arrangement of lines or pseudolines in the projective plane. As a
consequence, we find nine new infinite families of cubic partial cubes
as well as many sporadic examples.

This follows on to our previous paper on
 using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip  by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

    Approximate weighted farthest neighbors and minimum dilation stars.   J. Augustine ,
D. Eppstein, and
 K. Wortman .  arXiv:cs.CG/0602029 .  Proc. 16th Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference
(COCOON 2010) , Nha Trang, Vietnam.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6196, 2010, pp. 90–99 .   Discrete
Mathematics, Algorithms and Applications  2 (4): 553–565, 2010 .
 
The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.
  
    Guard placement for efficient point-in-polygon proofs.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.
  
    Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0604034 .  18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(3): Article 29, 2009 .
 
We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

    Upright-quad drawing of st-planar learning spaces.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0607094 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 282–293 .   J. Graph Algorithms and Applications  12 (1): 51–72 , 2008 (special
issue for GD'06).
 
We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

    Trees with convex faces and optimal angles.   J. Carlson
and D. Eppstein.   arXiv:cs.CG/0607113 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 77–88 .
 
We consider drawings of trees which, if the leaf edges were extended to
infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

    Choosing colors for geometric graphs via color space embeddings.   M. Dillencourt ,
D. Eppstein, and
 M. T. Goodrich .  arXiv:cs.CG/0609033 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 294–305 .
 
We show how to choose colors for the vertices of a graph drawing in such
a way that all colors are easily distinguishable, but such that adjacent
vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

    Happy endings for flip graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0610092 .  23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.   J. Computational Geometry  1 (1): 3–28, 2010 .
 
We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.
  
    Manhattan orbifolds.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/0612109 .   Topology and
its Applications  157 (2): 494–507, 2009 .
 
We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.
