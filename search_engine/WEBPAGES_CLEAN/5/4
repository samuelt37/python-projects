  Peg Game 

  Rules 
   the goal is to get a peg as high as possible
  (it is possible to get as high as 8, but that is pretty hard)
  a secondary goal is to minimize the number of moves to achieve
     a certain level
    initially all pegs are at level 0 or below
    a peg can move only by jumping another peg either horizontally,
      vertically, or diagonally
    the peg that was jumped over is removed

     PC Windows  operating system
      Solaris  operating system
     To play 
   move the cursor to be on the peg that will make the next jump
     by using the arrow keys for up, down, right, and left
   make the peg jump by using the following control keys:
     u = jump up
      l = jump left
      r = jump right
      L = jump diagonally up-left
      R = jump diagonally up-right
      z = jump diagonally down-left
      x = jump diagonally down-right
     
                L   u   R
                  \ | /
                l - + - r
                  /   \
                z       x
 
   undo the last jump by pressing the $ key
   record moves made so far by pressing the ! key
    (this creates a trace file named "trace")
   retrace moves made in an earlier game
     by renaming the trace file "input" and pressing the ! key

This problem was posed by Peter Winkler of Bell Labs
in his 2002 manuscript "Five Algorithmic Puzzles". 
He explains that this is a variation of a problem described
in  Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays , Vol. 2,
by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy (Academic Press, 1982).
The original problem, credited by Winkler to Conway,
did not permit diagonal jumps. 
That problem has an upper bound of level 4 achievable in 19 moves.
A  recent paper 
proves the correctness of the numbers shown above.
