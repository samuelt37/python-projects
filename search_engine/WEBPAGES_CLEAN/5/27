Interesting claim. Would you please elaborate, giving the argument
behind it? What about that scenario could Derived-From and
Content-Versio not handle/express?

&gt; One 
&gt;could, of course, munge on information to the fields but that is the same 
&gt;concept as cookies or URL appending.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Clearly the URL is not sufficient: multiple users can be working on the
&gt;&gt;same document.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;URL+username might be better, but I can easily imagine a case where the
&gt;&gt;same named user (or the same user) is working on a single document from
&gt;&gt;two different places.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;URL+username+hostname?  Maybe.
&gt;
&gt;This is what Derived-From: and Version: are all about: in
&gt;response to a GET (for edit), the server emits Version: ... .
&gt;
&gt;In the corresponding PUT, the client includes Derived-From: ... .
&gt;
&gt;See Dave Long's draft for details.
