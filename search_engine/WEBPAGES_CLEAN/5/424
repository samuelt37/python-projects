       Consequences 
of bad user interfaces       
      Bad interfaces 
may cause users to      • 
need more time for performing their tasks   • 
make more errors    • 
  feel dissatisfied    • 
need more time for learning how to use the software    •   not 
learn/use the full functionality of the software             • 
  (if given a choice:) refrain from using the software   
      Good 
interface design therefore is important for any kind of interactive software, 
and of  utmost  importance in        • 
systems with high costs of failure (e.g., nuclear power plants, space mission
      control)   • 
systems with high demands on operators (e.g., rescue coordination centers, combat 
aircraft, call centers)
