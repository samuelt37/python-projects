| &gt;Thus
| &gt;
| &gt;         http://foo.bar.com/version=best/A.html 
| &gt;         http://foo.bar.com/version=best/B.html 
| &gt;
| &gt;May get revision 2.1 of A.html and 2.0 of B.html.  Surfing works.
| &gt;

| But how do you handle the C.html case?  C.html wants to grab logo.gif,
| version 1.0, but A.html is already grabbing version 2.0 (and hence version
| 2.0 is presumably already mapped into "version=best", right?)

The same way you handle the case where a product has to be built with
two different versions of the same file:  you fire the guy who engineered
the situation.  This is source mis-management.

But at this point I'm not convinced I'm not missing something.
