Department of Defense policy states that DoD design and development 
of systems must be based on systems engineering principles. 
For software-intensive systems, these principles include selecting 
contractors with domain experience in developing comparable 
software systems, a successful past performance record, and a 
demonstrable, mature software development process. At the Space and 
Missile Systems Center (SMC), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), 
and Air Force Material Command (AFMC), two methods for evaluating 
contractor capability are in use. The first method is based on the 
Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) 
for software and uses the Software Capability Evaluation (SCE) process. 
The second method is the Software Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE), 
which includes its own model and process. Conducting either of these 
evaluations during the source selection process increases the likelihood 
of selecting a contractor capable of developing the required software 
within program constraints. Additionally, the SCE and SDCE help identify 
and manage risks early in a program's lifecycle and provide a means to 
obtain contractual commitment to the use of sound software engineering 
practices throughout the lifecycle.

  

The purpose of our presentation is to introduce the SDCE and compare it 
with the SCE. We will begin with an historical background of the SDCE and 
a brief description of its model and process, including revisions to the 
model that were developed at The Aerospace Corporation. We will then compare 
the SDCE and SCE in terms of their purposes, models, and processes, review 
applications of the SDCE and SCE to various DoD programs, and discuss the 
benefits of their use. Finally, we will examine lessons learned from past 
evaluation experiences.

  

 Biographies: 

Mrs. Rita C. Creel is Manager of the Acquisition Support Section in the 
Software Engineering Subdivision at The Aerospace Corporation, where she 
supports acquisition and analysis activities for large, software-intensive 
systems. Prior to joining Aerospace, Mrs. Creel worked in the Space and 
Technology Group at TRW, Inc., where she participated in and led full 
lifecycle software system development activities for communications and 
scientific satellite systems. She received her Bachelor of Science degree 
in Engineering and Computer Science from California State University, 
Long Beach.

  

Mrs. Bonnie R. Troup is an Engineering Specialist with The Aerospace 
Corporation. Mrs. Troup has more than 12 years of experience in software 
engineering and software acquisition management; she is currently the 
corporate focal point for the SDCE. During her previous employment at 
TRW, Mrs. Troup was Project Engineer and software engineering lead, where 
she participated in an SCE. Her work at Aerospace includes software 
systems engineering consulting services for the Evolved Expendable Launch 
Vehicle (EELV) program, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), 
and the Milstar program, and coordinating SDCE efforts for several program 
offices. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics 
from UC Riverside, and her Master of Science degree in Computer Science 
from Loyola Marymount University.
