  Collections: MKCOL  
      The MKCOL method creates a new collection
 
     MKCOL can be invoked with a request body
 
  No request body: empty collection is created
  Request body: media-type specific results
  primarily to reserve body for future capability
         Benefits:
 
  a simple method is used to create a collection
  MKCOL method avoids problems with adding collection creation semantics to PUT
