  Homework and Examination Policies 

 
   Homework Policies  
   Each set of homework exercises will contain
     some  required  problems —
  these are to be turned in to the class dropbox before 9:00am on the due date.
  Instructions for using EEE dropbox can be found at   https://eee.uci.edu/help/dropbox/students/  
    No late homework submissions will be accepted 
   Additionally, there will be
      suggested  problems —
     these are  not  to be turned in

   Some problems are marked with an  * ,
     indicating that they may be more challenging
   Homework sets will be graded mostly for effort; 
     however, a few problems will be graded for correctness

   Each student will have their worst homework assignment dropped,
     thus taking care of one instance of illness or forgetfulness
   Solutions to homework exercises will be discussed in discussion sessions

   All quizzes are in-class, closed-book, closed-notes
   Quizzes are to be strictly individual efforts —
     absolutely no collaboration is permitted
   Quizzes will be handed out at the beginning of class,
     or in the middle of class, and will be collected 7-10 minutes later
     ( late-comers must be seated before being given a quiz,
     and will not be given any extra time )
