 """IntegerHeap.py

Priority queues of integer keys based on van Emde Boas trees.
Only the keys are stored; caller is responsible for keeping
track of any data associated with the keys in a separate dictionary.

We use a version of vEB trees in which all accesses to subtrees
are performed indirectly through a hash table and the data structures
for the subtrees are only created when they are nonempty. As a
consequence, the data structure takes only linear space
(linear in the number of keys stored in the heap) while still preserving
the O(log log U) time per operation of vEB trees. For better performance,
we switch to bitvectors for sufficiently small integer sizes.

Usage:
    Q = BitVectorHeap() # Bit-vector based heap for integers
    Q = FlatHeap(i)     # Flat heap for 2^i-bit integers
    Q = LinearHeap()    # Set-based heap with linear-time min operation
    Q = IntegerHeap(i)  # Choose between BVH and FH depending on i
    Q.add(x)            # Include x among the values in the heap
    Q.remove(x)         # Remove x from the values in the heap
    Q.min()             # Return the minimum value in the heap
    if Q                # True if Q is nonempty, false if empty

Because the min operation in LinearHeap is a Python primitive rather than
a sequence of interpreted Python instructions, it is actually quite fast;
testing indicates that, for 32-bit keys, FlatHeap(5) beats LinearHeap only
for heaps of 250 or more items. This breakeven point would likely be
different for different numbers of bits per word or when runtime optimizers
such as psyco are in use.
