Visitors can enjoy rides on the waterfront Ferris Wheel, play games in the arcade or tour the nautical museum while enjoying their favorite beach treats. This is also a popular place to rent bikes, harbor cruises, whale watching excursions, or you can take off for a day trip to nearby Catalina Island on the Catalina Flyer. This area of the peninsula can also be reached via an auto ferry from Balboa Island. At the north end of the Peninsula is the iconic Crab Cooker restaurant, serving the area's best casual seafood and legendary clam chowder since 1951. You can also stroll around Balboa Island, and enjoy the shops on Main St.
