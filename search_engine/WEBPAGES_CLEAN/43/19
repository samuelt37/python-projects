See LRM sections 7.3.2

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
   
Aggregates are a grouping of values to form an array or record expression.
The first form is called  positional association , where the values are associated
with elements from left to right:
 
signal Z_BUS : bit_vector (3 downto 0);
signal A_BIT, B_BIT, C_BIT, D_BIT : bit;
...
Z_BUS 
  
   

 
   
Equivalent Assignments
 
Z_BUS(3) 
  
   

 
   Aggregates may be used as the targets of assignments 
   

   
   The second form is  named association , where elements are explicitly
referenced and order is not important:
 
signal Z_BUS : bit_vector (3 downto 0);
signal A_BIT, B_BIT, C_BIT, D_BIT : bit;
...
Z_BUS  B_BIT, 1 =&gt; C_BIT, 0 =&gt; D_BIT, 3 =&gt; A_BIT);
 
 
   

 
     
With positional association, elements may be grouped together using the | symbol or a range. 
The keyword  others  may be used to refer to all elements not already mentioned:
 
signal B_BIT : bit;
signal BYTE : bit_vector (7 downto 0);
...
BYTE '1', 5 downto 1 =&gt; '1', 6 =&gt; B_BIT, others =&gt; '0');
 
 
   

 
  
   Assignment to a whole record must be done using an aggregate. Positional or named association may be used
 
type T_PACKET is record
	BYTE_ID : std_ulogic;
	PARITY  : std_ulogic;
	ADDRESS : integer range 0 to 3;
	DATA    : std_ulogic_vector (3 downto 0);
end record
signal TX_DATA : T_PACKET;
...
TX_DATA   
   

 
  
   An aggregate containing just  others  can assign a value to all elements of an array, regardless of size:
 
type NIBBLE is array (3 downto 0) of std_ulogic;
type MEM is array (0 to 7) of NIBBLE;
variable MEM8X4: MEM := (others =&gt; "0000");
variable D_BUS : std_ulogic_vector(63 downto 0) := (others =&gt; 'Z');
 
 
   

 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

Logic synthesis tools may not support named association fully. 
Also, record assignments using aggregates may not be supported.

 
        Whats New in '93       

Aggregates have not changed in  VHDL -93.
