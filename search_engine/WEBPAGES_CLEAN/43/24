Remove INDEX

     Problem: 
 
  Set of properties returned by INDEX is arbitrary
  Results in a large amount of data transfer for large collections.
       Proposed Solution: 
 
  Make PROPFIND work recursively, allowing retrieval of client-specified sets of properties. 
  This makes PROPFIND, in essence, a customizable INDEX.  
  Remove the INDEX method since it is now redundant.
