  Kernel::ConstructBisector_2  


A model for this must provide:
 

    
          Kernel::Line_2   

         
          
             
    fo.operator() (     
      Kernel::Point_2  p,  Kernel::Point_2  q)     
                
    constructs the  bisector  of  p  and  q .
The  bisector  is oriented in such a way that  p  lies on its
positive side.  Precondition:   p  and  q  are not equal.
                 
          Kernel::Line_2   

         
          
             
    fo.operator() (     
      Kernel::Line_2  l1,  Kernel::Line_2  l2)     
                
    constructs the  bisector  of the two lines  l1  and  l2 .
In the general case, the  bisector  has the direction of the vector which
is the sum of the normalized directions of the two lines, and which passes
through the  intersection  of  l1  and  l2 .
If  l1  and  l2  are  parallel , then the  bisector  is defined as the line
which has the same direction as  l1 , and which is at the same distance
from  l1  and  l2 .
This function requires that   Kernel ::RT  supports the   sqrt () 
operation.
