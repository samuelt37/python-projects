 Computer Law Seminar Readings<body>
 
 Computer Law Seminar Readings  
  
 Many of these materials were written for lawyers,
which means they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring them to class
so I can (try to) clarify them.   
 
 Most of these references are available on-line,
but some will be available only on paper.  Access instructions for paper
materials appear below.  
 
 Access to some of the electronic references
may be restricted to the UCI community (which is an example of intellectual
property law in practice).  The URLs to those references will work from
computers at UCI.  If you (as a UCI student) want access from off campus,
you'll need to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using free software
available from UCI's NACS (for Windows, Linux, or MacOS X).  NACS has
a page describing how to download and install the VPN software:  http://www.nacs.uci.edu/security/vpn.html 
.  
 
 The readings come from a variety of sources,
such as:  
  
 Law review article—a law review is a publication
containing scholarly articles about the law, typically written by law professors
(for the main articles) or law students (for the shorter articles, often
designated "Note" or "Comment").  Law reviews are roughly
akin to academic journals in CS, except that they're edited at law schools
by law students.  A citation with "L.R" or "L.J." in
the title, especially along with a law school name, is probably a law review.
 Law review articles are among the most intensively documented publications
in the world; every assertion is backed up with a citation in a footnote.
 A tongue-in-cheek metric of the scholarly quality of a law review article
is the extent to which the volume of the footnotes exceeds the volume of
the main document.    
 
 Popular media article—Newspaper and magazine
articles tend to be accessible, since they're written for non-lawyers,
but they're subject to the problems we discussed in class (incompleteness,
oversimplification, technical inaccuracy, focus on sensational facts over
legal issues, lack of long-term follow-up).    
 
 Article in a professional publication—Articles
for computing professionals (e.g., in the  Communications of the ACM )
or for legal professionals (e.g., in the  ABA Journal  from the American
Bar Association) often hit a good balance between accessibility and accuracy.

            Lexis access:  The Lexis system was one of
                the first full-text-searchable databases, first available about 30 years
    ago.  Access is available to the UCI community at  http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe  .  You can search here for cases and statutes.  
        The meaning of legal terms goes beyond the plain English meaning of the words. Even a law dictionary won't give you all the nuances and applications of a legal term, but law dictionaries are a place to start. Two on-line law dictionaries are at  dictionary.law.com  and  dictionary.findlaw.com .  
        
  Computer Law—General  [for reference;
not an assignment]   
  
 There are good, short, reasonably current
overviews of many legal topics at  http://lp.findlaw.com 
, which also provides access to statutes and reported cases (i.e., appellate
court opinions).    
 
 NGOs (non-governmental organizations) often
follow legislation and pending cases in their areas of interest.    
     The ACM has a public policy office and web
      site:   http://www.acm.org/usacm/    
   
     The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( http://www.eff.org/ )
      addresses a wide range of computing-related legal and policy issues.   
   
     The Recording Industry Association of America
      ( http://www.riaa.com/ ) and the Motion
      Picture Association of America ( http://www.mpaa.org/ )
      take an industry perspective.   
   
     The Electronic Privacy Information Center
      ( http://www.epic.org ) covers privacy issues,
      as does the American Civil Liberties Union ( http://www.aclu.org/ ).
