       ==== If you are not a Lobbyist or a Staffer on a case study, then you are a Reporter  ==== </strong> 
        Each student in the group must do this  individually</strong>, not as a group. 
       Attend both days of the case study, so that you can hear both the lobbyists and the staffers. 
       After Tuesday 7pm, go to the  ICS 11 EEE Dropbox ., and review the reports and slides of the lobbyists.       
        On Thurday</strong> during the last 30 minutes of class, you will be called on to ask a question of the staffers.
