         I urge you to spend some time reading through the material on this course Web site.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the  Course Reference , the  Schedule , the  Lab Manual , and the  newsgroup . 
         This course will be a work in progress throughout the quarter, with the  Schedule  and  Lab Manual  updated periodically throughout.  Keep an eye on this page — check back every day or so — for information about updates.
