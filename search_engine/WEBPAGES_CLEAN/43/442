   eCACTI is a tool used for finding an estimate of
cache area, access times, and power dissipation for a given set of
parameters (cache size, block size, associativity, and technology).
  
eCACTI is an enhanced version of an existing tool, 
 
CACTI , that was developed by Wilton and Jouppi.
   The main enhancements in eCACTI are:    Estimation of leakage power dissipation 
  Calculation of device widths as a function of capacitive loads 
  Calculation of power dissipation in all cache sub-blocks
