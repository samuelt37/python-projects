 Cellular Automata: Complex Patterns from Simple Rules<body>
 Cellular Automata: Complex Patterns from Simple Rules 
 David Eppstein, University Studies 3, Spring 2007 

 Cellular automata such as Conway's famous "Game of Life" are systems
for describing complex and changing visual patterns based on very simple
computational rules. In this seminar, we'll see the kinds of patterns
that can be generated with cellular automata, find out about computer
programs for exploring cellular automaton rules, and learn about how
these systems can model phenomena from the physical world. 

 The course will meet Mondays, 11:00 - 11:50, in CS 360D. Grading will
be attendance-based.
