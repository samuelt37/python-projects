       About  
     I am a PhD candidate in UCI’s  Informatics program . I am originally from Seattle, WA and I went to the University of Washington for my undergraduate in Computer Engineering with a specialization in hardware. 
 My primary research is on the users of the crytpocurrency Bitcoin. My research interests also include sharing economy applications and crowdsourcing platforms. 
 I am a member of the  TechDeC lab  and the  EVOKE lab  at UCI. I am co-advised by  Bonnie Nardi  and  Geof Bowker . 
 I have three cute kitties. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, video games, reading, and music. I used to host a  metal radio show  on  KUCI .
