    About Us  
    The  Grand Challenges in Global Health  initiative is a partnership dedicated to supporting  scientific and technical research to solve critical health problems in the  developing world.  The initiative's  partners are the  Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , the  Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the  Foundation for the National Institutes of Health , and the  Wellcome Trust .  
    The Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative was established in 2002 as  a way to galvanize and focus the scientific community to achieve scientific  breakthroughs to fight diseases that kill millions of people each year in the  world's poorest countries.  
    We were awarded a GCGH grant   in 2005 to find ways to prevent or  reduce the transmission of dengue viruses using the  emerging tools of mosquito  molecular genetics with a commitment to understanding and addressing the ethical, social, and cultural  issues that would accompany such efforts.
