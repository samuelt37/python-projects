          Traveling salesman tours were formed by repeatedly adding the point that 
makes the augmented tour longest. Points were placed 
uniformly at random in the unit square. Times include only the construction of the closest pair data structure 
and algorithm execution (not the initial point placement) and are averages 
over ten runs.  The quadtree data structure was only run on data sets of 
1000 or fewer points due to its high storage requirements.  Code was 
written in C++, compiled and optimized by Metrowerks Codewarrior 10, and 
run on a 200MHz PowerPC 603e processor (Apple Powerbook 3400c).
