        Bounding Search Space Size via (Hyper)tree Decompositions.    
        Lars Otten and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   

This paper develops a measure for bounding the performance of AND/OR search
algorithms for solving a variety of queries over graphical models.
We show how drawing a connection to
the recent notion of hypertree decompositions allows to
exploit determinism in the problem specification and produce
tighter bounds.
We demonstrate on a variety of practical problem instances that we are often able
to improve upon existing bounds by several orders of magnitude.
