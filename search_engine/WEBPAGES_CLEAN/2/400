 Parking Information and Directions to the  
UC Irvine University Club 
using an  IRUS Parking Permit  

If this is your first visit to the UCI campus, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a 
 
map 
with building numbers.
 
 
The University Club (UClub) has its own parking lot (18B). 
You do not need a permit to park in this lot. However, this lot
is small and fills up quickly. In addition, you can only park there for
the duration of the meeting. If you have other plans on campus, you will
have to move your car (they   will  ticket).
 
  
To be safe, you should bring an IRUS permit with you in case lot 18B is
full or you need to stay on campus after the meeting.
 
 
Corporate sponsors  should obtain a
preferred IRUS parking permit from your
 
corporate representative 
   prior to the meeting  .
 

  
 
Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to walk to the University Club.
