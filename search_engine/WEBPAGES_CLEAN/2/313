Title: Improved Approximation Algorithms for
Maximum Cut and Satisfiability Problems Using Semidefinite Programming (JACM 1995)
 
 
Authors: M. Goemans and D. Williamson
 
 
Abstract:
 
 
This publication, currently, provides the best approximation ratio for the Maximum Cut problem, using a
novel application of Semidefinite Programming on Approximation Algorithms.
We, furthermore, discuss some newer applications and results of this
technique. We focus only on the Maximum Cut problem.
