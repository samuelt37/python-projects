Universal Permutations
 
 
by Bannister, Cheng, Devanny and Eppstein
 
 
Presented by Will Devanny 
 

 
I am planning to present on Universal Permutations.  We will cover the combinatorics of permutations and patterns and how sets of patterns can be packed into permutations.  In particular we will cover a $k$-universal permutation of length $k^2/2 + o(k^2)$ and new research by Bannister, Cheng, Devanny, and Eppstein on a $213$-avoiding universal permutation of length $k^2/4 + o(k^2)$.
