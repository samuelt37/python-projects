 MOVE and DELETE<body>

  MOVE and DELETE  
      Default: Apply to reference
 
     Apply to target by sending request to the URI in the DAV:reftarget property
 
     Rationale:
 
  MOVE and DELETE affect membership in collections, not individual resources
  Should affect only the collection where the reference resides
  Should not affect the membership of the collection where the target resides
  Should not affect other collections that contain references to the target

If a reference-aware client REALLY wants to apply the method to the target, it can do so by looking up the targetï¿½s URI in the DAV:reftarget property, and submitting the request to it.
  
Other rationale:
  
This is the way file systems behave.
  
Passing MOVE and DELETE through to targets can do very widespread damage (much more so than other methods that affect only individual resources).  They can result in every reference to the moved or deleted resource being broken, and if applied to a collection, then every reference to every member of the collection might be broken.  </body>
