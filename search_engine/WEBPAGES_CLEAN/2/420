 (5:00 PM PST) 
 
 
 
The final alpha release of Chimera 2.0 is now available. This release
features the use of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) to provide the
server's user-interfaces, the ability to import and export hyperwebs
and websites, and the removal of all external software dependencies (except for
the JFC which is not yet bundled with the JDK). The new release is available

  New C API for the Chimera 2.0 alpha release.

Chimera 2.0 can now support clients written in C via the new C application
program interface for Chimera 2.0. The new api is available on the

  Small enhancements to the 2.0 alpha release. 
 (1:40 PM PST) 
 
 
 
The Chimera 2.0 alpha release experienced some minor bug fixes and received
a few new operations in order to support the new Chimera 2.0 C API. All
users of Chimera 2.0 are encouraged to upgrade to this new release.
 
 
 

 
  New clients for Chimera 2.0! 
 (2:10 PM PST) 
 
 
 
We are pleased to release alpha-level versions of a set of Chimera 2.0
clients. These clients have been minimally tested (we use them in our
Chimera 2.0 demos), and have no documentation. This situation will
change for the beta release. For now, we are making these available
to Chimera 2.0 client developers so that they can learn by example.
The clients are available from the
 software  page.
 
 
The new clients include Chimera Shell, a command line interface to the
Chimera server, an XEmacs integration, a JPEG and GIF image viewer written
in Java, and a wrapper integration for Netscape 3.0.
 
 
These clients have only been tested on the Solaris platform.
