This is more of a random list of how-to topics than a tutorial.                -    </strong>  +  =====  Stylesheets </strong>=====    -  =====  Basics </strong>= ==== </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   There are three main categories of file for Ipe:  </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -     * Ipe document (.ipe, .pdf, .ps, etc.) </strong>  +      -     * Style sheets (.isy) </strong>  +      -     * Ipelets (.lua) </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   ==== Ipe Document ==== </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   Ipe can save and open documents in a variety of formats, including xml, pdf, and postscript. See the [[http://ipe7.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_41.html|Ipe Manual]] for more details. </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   You can use ''ipetoipe'' to convert between these different formats. Sometimes, this might be necessary to fix problems with the program: </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   === Quote character (") in a layer name === </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   Never put quote characters (") in the name of a layer. Ipe will crash when you try to open such a document. </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   == How to fix it: == </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   Internally, Ipe saves files as xml. Even if you save it as a pdf, Ipe will embed the xml inside the pdf. Ipe must be able to parse this xml in order to properly load a file. However, if you put (") characters in places that get written as metadata, Ipe will not be able to parse the xml. You will get poorly formatted xml that looks like this: </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   &lt;code&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;page title="&amp;apos;this&amp;quot; is fixed for titles"&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;layer name="don't_do_"this""/&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;view layers="don't_do_"this"" active="don't_do_"this""/&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;text layer="don't_do_"this"" transformations="translations" pos="128 704" stroke="black" type="label" width="36.862" height="6.128" depth="0" valign="baseline"&gt;test text&lt;/text&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;/page&gt; </strong>  +      -   &lt;/code&gt; </strong>  +      -   When you try and open this file, you will get an error like this: </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -       Document '/home/jsimons/Desktop/bad_ipe.ipe' could not be opened </strong>  +      -       Parsing error at position 6051 </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   Ipe is helpfully trying to tell you which character the xml parser failed on. To fix it, you have to manually edit the xml. If you saved as .ipe, then just open up the file in your favorite text editor and remove the extra quotes from the xml. If you saved it as a pdf, you first have to extract the xml from the pdf (since in the pdf it's saved as a byte stream, you can't see the plain text). One easy way to do this is to run </strong>  +      -   &lt;code&gt;ipetoipe -xml input.pdf output.ipe&lt;/code&gt; </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -    </strong>  +      -   ==== Style sheets </strong>====  +                     Stylesheets are text files that can be included to customize various formatting aspects of an Ipe document. For example, you can use it to define more colors, add transparency levels, or create gradients. Stylesheets work a bit like preambles in LaTeX. Multiple stylesheets can be used in one Ipe document, and a single stylesheet can be reused over multiple documents.     Stylesheets are text files that can be included to customize various formatting aspects of an Ipe document. For example, you can use it to define more colors, add transparency levels, or create gradients. Stylesheets work a bit like preambles in LaTeX. Multiple stylesheets can be used in one Ipe document, and a single stylesheet can be reused over multiple documents.                   By default, Ipe uses a basic style sheet ''basic.isy''. To use your own stylesheet, you can either have Ipe automatically load it for every document, or you add it manually for each document. You would want to use the former option for things that are useful across documents, like color definition and transparency levels, and the latter option for things specific to the document, like backgrounds and location of the title text.     By default, Ipe uses a basic style sheet ''basic.isy''. To use your own stylesheet, you can either have Ipe automatically load it for every document, or you add it manually for each document. You would want to use the former option for things that are useful across documents, like color definition and transparency levels, and the latter option for things specific to the document, like backgrounds and location of the title text.    -         -  Regardless of how you have Ipe load the stylesheet, if the stylesheet changes, you must do ''Edit &gt; Update style sheets'' for Ipe to see the changes.       -         -  === Loading stylesheets automatically ===       -         -  Here's how we can add and change the default stylesheets loaded by Ipe.       -         -    * Add the stylesheets you want into a styles directory. Typically this is ''~/.ipe/styles'' (you may need to create the directory yourself).       -    * In your customization Ipelet, add the names of all the stylesheets you want to load automatically: &lt;code&gt;       -  prefs.styles = { "basic", "good_colors" }       -  &lt;/code&gt;       -         -  === Adding stylesheets manually ===                      The workflow of using a stylesheet specific to a document:     The workflow of using a stylesheet specific to a document:    Line 71: 
 Line 19:         - Include it in the Ipe document: in Ipe, go to ''Edit &gt; Style sheets &gt; Add''.       - Include it in the Ipe document: in Ipe, go to ''Edit &gt; Style sheets &gt; Add''.         - Update it: in Ipe, click ''Edit &gt; Update style sheets''. This must be done every time an included stylesheet is modified.       - Update it: in Ipe, click ''Edit &gt; Update style sheets''. This must be done every time an included stylesheet is modified.    -         -         -  ===== Customizations =====       -         -  You can use Ipelets to customize the behavior of Ipe.       -  http://ipe7.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_40.html       -         -  The customization script is written as an Ipelet. The easiest way to do the customization is to copy ''prefs.lua'', ''shortcuts.lua'', and ''mouse.lua'' in the Ipe lua directory to your Ipelets directory and modify them to your liking. (Use ''-show-configuration'' to see where these directories are.)       -         -  The ''mouse.lua'' is also good for discovering all the useful mouse shortcuts in Ipe.       -         -         -  ===== Example Stylesheets =====                      ==== Color-blind colors ====     ==== Color-blind colors ====    Line 103:

(Skim should support it, but not Adobe Acrobat, although this may have changed.)                   ==== Gradient ====     ==== Gradient ====    Line 132: 
 Line 67:                   Once the stylesheet uploaded, the gradient option should show up in the context menu of objects that can have a gradient fill.     Once the stylesheet uploaded, the gradient option should show up in the context menu of objects that can have a gradient fill.    -         -  ===== Ipelets =====       -         -  You can expand the existing functionality of Ipe by using Ipelets, which are [[http://www.lua.org/|Lua]] scripts that Ipe runs on-the-fly. The installed Ipelets can be accessed and used under the "Ipelets" menu item.       -         -  Each Ipelet consists of a single Lua source file with other support files. To install an Ipelet, simply save the files in your Ipelets directory. You can run ''ipe -show-configuration'' to find out where that directory is (typically, this is ''~/.ipe/ipelets'').       -         -  The bottom of the [[http://lamut.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/mediawiki/ipe7/index.php/Main_Page#Ipelets|Ipe Wiki]] has a good list of Ipelets. They include things like automatic page numbering, background boxes for text, and graph drawing tools (where edges will follow when vertices are dragged).       -         -  ==== CGAL Ipelets ====       -  This is assuming that Ipe is already installed and runs successfully.       -         -  On debian:       -    0.

Compile the demo(s).        -    To make just the Ipelets, go to the ready-to-compile subdirectory (yes, it's another nested level, demo/demo/), and make.       -    It will take a few minutes to compile all the Ipelets       -        * $ cd ~/CGAL/demo/demo/CGAL_ipelets/       -        * $ make       -    6. Copy the compiled output '*.so' files and the '*.lua' into the Ipelet directory.        -       On the default 7.1.3 Ipe installation, the command is:       -        * $ sudo find . -name '*.so' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;       -        * $ sudo find ~/CGAL/demo/CGAL_ipelets/lua/ -name '*.lua' -exec cp '{}' /usr/local/lib/ipe/7.1.3/ipelets/ \;                      ===== Presentations =====     ===== Presentations =====    Line 201: 
 Line 100:       The ''textsize'' and ''textstretch'' can be used alone to define a text style (size and shape). They simply have to have the same ''name'' attribute.
