Costs of ADL Interpreters

     Reduce the cost of developing interpreters by
 
  Writing an �interpreter generator� whose input is the specification of the ADL
  Writing an ADL spec for each target ADL
       With two interpreters running in the same environment:
 
  You can make changes to the architecture in the ADL of choice
  You can use several ADLs to work on the same architecture       --&gt;
