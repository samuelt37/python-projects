	sassign     sassign is C++ and Matlab package for tracking larger numbers of 
	closely positioned cells (landmarks) with similar geometrical 
	characteristics through timeseries of frames where some cells may divide 
	into two daughter cells. Each frame may contains repositioned cells from the previous frame with 
	some of them divided into two parts, and/or a few number of outliers e.g. cells appeared/disappeared from the 
	boundaries of the frame or miscounted due to preprocessing errors. The C++ 
	processing module is based on an advanced version of the softassign 
	algorithm where simulated annealing is used to minimize a global target 
	function over all possible parent-parent or parent-daughters associations of 
	cells. The Matlab part of the 
	package consists of wrapper routines for running the code and building hierarchical tree of the cells
