                  :: Teaching  
                  
                    In 2008, I co-taught a  
                    capstone project course  at Notre Dame University along with
                     Prof. Aaron Striegel   and
                    and  Prof. Christian Poellabauer,  and defined the
                    Motorola Labs challenge project. The collaboration was fun and
                     here  is an impressive demo created
                    by one of the student teams.
                 

                 
                    In the past, I have TA'ed and lectured at UCI, mostly for the Operating Systems course. I have
                  experience in creating class projects, designing exams and grading.
