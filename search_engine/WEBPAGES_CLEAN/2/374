 ICS 180: Strategy and board game programming  

  Course Project 

Since the goal of the course is to learn how to write a computer game
program, the primary coursework will consist of a project in which teams
of students write such a program.  Project teams should consist of 3 or
4 students.  Each project is expected to go through the following
milestones (described in more detail on the pages linked to each topic):

   7 Jan: 
     Form project teams 
       14 Jan: 
      Submit a proposal  describing the
	game to be programmed,
	detailing the features of game positions to be used
	in evaluating game positions,
        and listing the tasks assigned to each of the team members 
       21 Jan: 
     I will review the proposals and return them to you. Start coding! 
       4 Feb: 
     Complete work on the user interface, board representation, and
    move generation modules of your program.  These modules should link
    together to form a program
    that acts as a game board for human-human play. 
   25 Feb: 
     Target date for producing a working program, leaving the rest of
    the quarter for testing, evaluation function improvement, and the
    addition of more sophisticated search algorithms. 
       11 Mar: 
     Turn in your final projects along with written reports
    describing the project status. 
       Finals week: 
     Project demonstrations
