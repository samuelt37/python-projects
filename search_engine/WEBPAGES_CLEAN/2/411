   News     
  
    
Khanh Nguyen was selected as a  Facebook fellowship finalist . Congrats, Khanh! 
  

  
    The Graspan disk-based parallel (evolving) graph system was released ( https://github.com/Graspan ) after 1.5 years of development and tuning involving 
our postdoc Zhiqiang Zuo, Ph.D. students Kai Wang and Aftab Hussain, and two undergraduate students John Thorpe and Sungsoo Son. It has a Java version and a C++ version. 
Please consider using Graspan if you have (static or dynamic) transitive closure computation problems over very large graphs.
  


      We will present a  tutorial  in ASPLOS'17, which will introduce our Big Data perspectives on program analysis scalability.
  

  
    Graspan and KickStarter were both accepted to ASPLOS'17. Congratuations to Keval, Kai, Aftab, and Zhiqiang! 
  
  
    The Yak paper accepted to OSDI'16. Congratulations to Khanh and Lu!

      A sole-PI grant awarded from ONR to support my research on Big Data systems building.
  

  
    A REU supplement awarded from NSF CNS to support two undergraduate researchers. 
  

      A paper accepted to TOSEM with minor revision.
  

      The refinement-based statistical debugging paper accepted to OOPSLA'16 and artifact evaluated. Congratulations to Zhiqiang and Lu!
  

  
    The DynaGraph paper accepted to USENIX ATC'16. Congratulations to Keval!
  

  
    
PerfBlower  was released! 
If you work on dynamic analysis but do not want to hack JVM, try our
instrumentation specification language (ISL) in PerfBlower. Read
our  ECOOP'15  paper or  the Morning Paper introduction  of the paper for details.
  

  
   One idea
paper was accepted to PLOS'15 (colocated with
SOSP'15). Congratulations to Khanh and Lu!
  

     The ''interruptible task'' paper was accepted to SOSP'15. Congratulations to  Lu and Khanh!
  

    GraphQ is publicly available! Try  it  if you have a very large graph but only want to know information about a small number of vertices and edges.
  

  
  The GraphQ paper was
accepted to USENIX ATC'15. Congratulations to Kai!
  

    The PerfBlower paper was
accepted to ECOOP'15. Congratulations to Lu!

  A new (sole-PI) grant awarded from NSF CNS.  

  
  We have released   Resurrector  , a new object lifetime profiling tool!
Please read our OOPSLA'13 paper for details.   

  
  We have released our  demand-driven
context-sensitive alias analysis ! This analysis gives you better
performance as it does not need to perform  a points- to
analysis first. 

  
  Our Big Data design paper got a  Chinese  transaltion  

  
  One paper accepted to ESEC/FSE'13.
Congratulations to Khanh, who has a top conference paper before finishing the
first year!

  
  One paper accepted to OOPSLA'13.

  
  All the talk slides for the
pre-OOPSLA-PC-meeting workshop can be found  here . Thanks to all the contributing
PC members!

     About Me   

 I am an assistant professor in the  computer
science department  of  University of
California, Irvine . 

  My research ranges from software engineering, through programming
languages and compilers, to runtime/operating/distributed systems and
computer architecture. My recent interest is to develop cross-layer
techniques that bridge the PL and systems communities -- in
particular, (1)  how to use PL techniques to solve systems
(especially Big Data systems) problems, and, conversely, (2)
how to solve PL problems (e.g., program analysis scalability, SAT/Datalog
solver parallelizability, memory energy efficiency, etc.)  with systems
and architectural support.
