Collusion in Auctions for Digital Goods
 
Presented by Matthew Nguyen
 
 
Abstract: 
Auctions for digital goods are auctions where the auctioneer has an
unlimited supply of a single commodity.  In this auction framework, we
consider a bidder model where each participant has a probability p of
joining a collective colluding group.  We show that any auction that is
B-competitive without colluders, is B/(1-p) 2 -competitive in the presence
of colluders no matter the colluding strategy.
  
This is joint work with Sandy Irani, Gwendoline Shu-Hsien Chien, and
Matthew Nguyen.
