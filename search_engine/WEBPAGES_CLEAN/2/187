Ancient:  These are changes to sections of text which were not properly updated in -07, and do not represent any new functionality or requirements.  Editorial:  These are changes to make the draft easier to read, prettier, or more clear.  They do not represent any new functionality or requirements.

    Changes  
  NULL_DEF  
  We need to define the term NULL resource and lock-null resource, define what methods it takes (LOCK, UNLOCK, PROPFIND, OPTIONS, etc.), what errors it returns for other methods (404 &amp; 405), and what properties it must support (all mandatory DAV properties although most will be empty).

    D'oh  
  Prop_Lock_207  
  In 7.10.10 the example does not currently return the lockdiscovery property as it is required to.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0275.html  
    D'oh  
  locktoken_href  
  Current DTD allows an empty href for the locktoken element, that is illegal.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0275.html  
    D'oh  
  7.1.2_empty  
  In 7.1.2 we refer to an empty resource as undefined not empty

    Ancient  
  5.3_locktoken_in_header  
  5.3 states that a lock token must be returned in the locktoken response header, but we now return the lock token in the body  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0277.html  
    Editorial  
  4.1_collection_def  
  The current collection definition could be interpreted to restrict the use of GET on collections.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0282.html  
    Ancient  
  4.4_single_source  
  The text in the last paragraph in section 4.4 says that the source link is only to be used when there is a single source, however that was never intended to be the requirement and in fact the current syntax allows for multiple source/dst elements.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0282.html  
    D'oh  
  7.2_propatch  
  The first sentence of the last paragraph of section 7.2 specifies that a PROPPATCH must contain at least one PROPERTYUPDATE element, this is a bug, it meant one and only one.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0002.html  
    Ancient  
  7.10.6_refresh  
  7.10.6's table talks about regranting and the last paragraph does as well but this is a bug, it is illegal to ask for the same lock twice.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0002.html  
    Ancient  
  7.11.1_lock_token  
  The lock-token header in the unlock example in 7.11.1 uses the old lock-token format  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0002.html  
    D'oh  
  7.6.2.1_d'oh  
  One of the URLs in the explination paragraph uses ww. Instead of www.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0002.html  
    Ancient  
  11.10.1.1_Propstat  
  The propstat description is from ancient version of the draft, the descriptive language and examples are all correct.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0002.html  
    Editorial  
  22_references  
  We have divided the references into normative and informational, apparently this sort of division makes the RFC editor very happy.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Editorial  
  9.5_424  
  The last sentence in the paragraph is unclear, I have tightened its language.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Changes  
  XML_Names  
  The appendix has been updated to the latest XML namespace draft. All namespace examples in the draft have been updated to use the new syntax.  Also updated reference to a WD from a NOTE. The only change of relevance to us is that the name attribute became "ns" and "as" became "prefix".  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Editorial  
  7.1.1_non-collection  
  Example 7.1.1 has been turned into a PROPFIND on a non-collection resource because there were questions on what this would look like.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Editorial  
  xml_null_warning  
  Split 24.3 into two parts, the first on the difference in meaning between &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a/&gt; and the second on illegally formatted XML.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Editorial  
  if_examples  
  Made the examples in sections 8.4.1 &amp;  8.4.2 into their own sections.  
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998AprJun/0007.html  
    Editorial  
  example_headers  
  We use a number of different formats to identify an example in the headers, we have gone through and made them all consistent. They are all now in the form "example - �."
