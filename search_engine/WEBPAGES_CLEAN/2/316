Appeared as "Efficient algorithms with applications to molecular biology" in

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

    Searching for spaceships .

MSRI Combinatorial Game Theory Research Worksh., July 2000.  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 433–453 .
 
We describe software that searches for
 spaceships in Conway's Game of
Life and related two-dimensional cellular automata .
Our program searches through a state space
related to the de Bruijn graph of the automaton,
using a method that combines features of breadth first and
iterative deepening search, and includes fast
bit-parallel  graph reachability 
and  path enumeration  algorithms
for finding the successors of each state.
Successful results include a
 new 2c/7
spaceship in Life , found by searching a space with 2^126 states.

 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 341–350 .
 
We describe by a regular expression the one-dimensional peg-solitaire
positions reducible to a single peg, and provide a linear-time algorithm
(based on finding  shortest paths  in an
associated DAG) for
reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg
solitaire moves in an attempt to be the one to move last.

    Phutball endgames are hard .  E. Demaine ,

and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CC/0008025 .  
 More Games of No Chance ,
R. J. Nowakowski, ed., MSRI Publications 42, pp. 351–360 .
 
We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's
Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the
current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In
contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

We unfold any polyhedron with triangular faces into a planar layout in
which the triangles are disjoint and are connected in a sequence from
vertex to vertex

    Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres .

and
 G. Ziegler .  arXiv:math.CO/0204007 .  Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday ,
Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.
 
We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Separating thickness from geometric thickness .

10th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Irvine, 2002. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  2528, 2002, pp. 150–161. 
In  Towards a Theory of Geometric Graphs , AMS, 2004, Contemporary
Math 342, J. Pach, ed., pp. 75–86.
 
We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments
similar to those in
" Separating book thickness from thickness ".
