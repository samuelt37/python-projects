 Community-Wide Markup Languages<body>

  Community-Wide Markup Languages  
      Community size is inversely proportional to shared context
 
  Millions agree that &lt;B&gt; means bold, but �2/6/98� reflects local culture
  XML decentralizes control of specialized markup languages,making it cost-effective to capture community ontologies
       HTML is not unilaterally extensible --	new tags potentially have ambiguous syntax, style, and semantics
 
     XML is a strict (but simplified) subset of SGML, offering:
 
  Extensibility -- can define new elements, containers, attribute names
  Structure -- a DTD can constrain the information model of a document
  Validation -- every document can be validated; also, well-formedness can establish conformance to the structure mandated by the DTD
       XML includes extensible linking and style formatting also
 
     �Node content must be left free to evolve.�  [Tim Berners-Lee, 1991, �About Document Formats�]
