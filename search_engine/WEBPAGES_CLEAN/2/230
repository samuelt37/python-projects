 Victim Caching<body>

  Victim Caching  
      VC useful in case of conflict misses, long sequential reference streams. Prevent sharp fall off in performance when WSS is slightly larger than L1.
 
     Estimate WSS from the structure of the RM such as the size of the strongly connected components (SCCs)
 
     MORPH data-path structure supports addition of a parameterized victim/stream cache. The control logic is synthesized using CAD tools.
 
     Victim caches provide 50X the marginal improvement in hit rate over the primary cache.
