(This is a classic problem in Machine Learning.)

  
 10 points. 
Problem 8.7 from de Berg et al.

  
 10 points. 
Problem 8.10 from de Berg et al.

  
 10 points. 
Problem 8.15 from de Berg et al.,
except you should come up with algorithms
thtat have the desired time bounds for 8.15b and 8.15c 
in the worst case, not expected case.
You may use O(n 2  log n)$ space.
