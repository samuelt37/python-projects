  Queries 
     With the  MoinMoin  search engine the same search patterns are allowed in the search and title search input fields as in the parameters for the  FullSearch    (FullSearchCached)  and the  PageList  macros.        There may be several search term seperated by white space     Terms are combined by default with an AND operation - only pages containing all search term are returned     Double or single quotes may be used to include white space within search terms (phrase search)         -  before a search term means NOT. Pages containing this term are excluded from the result        regex:TERM  is treated as a regular expression.  MoinMoin follows Python regex rules (see  http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html  for more info)        title:TERM  searches in pages whose titles match TERM      Normal search terms do search the titles, too. Matches in titles get more weight than matches in pages.         case:TERM  searches case sensitive        linkto:TERM  searches for links to TERM        language:LANG-ISO-CODE  searches for pages written in a given language ISO code, e.g. en, de        category:CAT  searches for pages belonging to CategoryCAT; replaces old regular expression        mimetype:TYPE  searches for pages and attachments with mimetype TYPE, e.g. image/png         Currently only available with Xapian!   Does this comment apply to item above or below??           domain:TERM  searches for pages in a domain like underlay or system (for system pages)        title: ,  regex: ,  linkto:  and  case:  may be used in combination in one search term       these modifiers may be abbreviated to any length: e.g.  re: ,  t: ,  reg: ,  cas: ,  l:        If you want to use multiple prefixes, you have to concatenate them like this:  t:re:TERM         -  must be put before any other modifiers          OR  operator has a lower precedence than the implicit AND (e.g.,  car deisel or gas  will find any page containing both "car" and "deisel", but will also hit on pages containing "gas", even if "car" is not on the page.)      Parentheses can be used for grouping        
  Examples 
             title:Help macro    searches for help pages that contain the word "macro".               apple (computer or "operating system")    searches for pages containing the word "apple" and at least one of "computer" or "operating system".               windows winamp or linux xmms    searches for pages containing both "windows" and "winamp", and also for pages containing both "linux" and "xmms".               "is text"    Will match "th is text</strong>" or " is text</strong>s". Quotes are used only to include whitespace, and do not mean "exactly this phrase".               linkto:WindowsPage title:Linux   searches for pages that have "Linux" in the page name and that link to WindowsPage              r:\bdog\b   searches for the word "dog" and does  not  find e.g. the word "doggy".              help -domain:system   search for pages containing the word "help" but which are not system pages              category:homepage title:thomas   search for pages in  CategoryHomepage  with the word "thomas" in the title (user homepages of all persons named Thomas)      
  TitleSearch and PageList 
    uses the same patterns       title:  is virtually added to every search term
