Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees
 
 
Michael Bannister
 

 

We investigate exact crossing minimization for graphs 
that differ from trees by a small number of additional edges, 
for several variants of the crossing minimization problem. 
In particular, we provide fixed parameter tractable algorithms for 
the 1-page book crossing number, the 2-page book crossing number, 
and the minimum number of crossed edges in 1-page and 2-page book drawings. 
 
 

This is joint work with David Eppstein and Joe Simons.
