 Unifying Cluster-Tree Decompositions for Automated Reasoning 

 Kalev Kask, Rina Dechter, Javier Larrosa and Avi Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper provides a unifying perspective of tree-decomposition
algorithms appearing in various automated reasoning areas such as
join-tree clustering for constraint-satisfaction and the clique-tree al-
gorithm for probabilistic reasoning. Within this framework, we in-
troduce a new algorithm, called bucket-tree elimination (BTE), that
extends Bucket Elimination (BE) to trees, and show that it can pro-
vide a speed-up of n over BE for various reasoning tasks. Time-space
tradeoï¿½s of tree-decomposition processing are analyzed.
