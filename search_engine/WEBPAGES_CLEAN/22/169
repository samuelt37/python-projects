 The Power of Simple Tabulation Hashing 
 Michael Bannister, UC Irvine 

 The simplest possible form of tabulation hashing provides
unexpectedly strong guarantees.  The presentation will focus on the
analysis of tabulation hashing for linear probing and cuckoo
hashing. 

(Based on  a paper  by
Mihai Pătraşcu and Mikkel Thorup to be presented at  STOC 2011 .)
