   I am a PhD candidate in 
 computer science  at University of California, Irvine (UCI).
I am working under supervision of  Prof. Nader Bagherzadeh 
in the  Advanced Computer Architecture Group (ACAG) . 
 I earned my M.Sc. degree
 under supervision of  Prof. Seyed-Ghassem Miremadi  from Sharif University, Tehran 
 and B.Sc. degree under supervision of  Prof. Mahmood Fathy  from University of Science and Technology, Tehran.  
 My research interests include high performance computing, system level solutions for reliabile embedded systems design, and reconfigurable System-on-Chip (SoC).
