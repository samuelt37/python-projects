Parallel External Memory Model
 

 Nodari Sitchinava, UCI 

 
 Abstract: 
  
I will talk about a new model of parallel computation which is
designed with multicore architectures in mind. The model takes into
explicit consideration the cache-oriented nature of inputs and
outputs in modern CPUs. I will present a parallel sorting algorithm
which is provably optimal in both running time and cache-miss rate.
  
This is joint work with Michael Goodrich and Michael Nelson.
