unsigned int GetMinAtoms() const
    
This method is used to set the minimum size of a common subgraph for
the subgraph to be returned as a maximum common subgraph.  In theory,
the smallest possible subgraph can consist of a single atom.  For many
applications, however, the maximum common must reach a user-specified
size to be considered useful.  Maximum common subgraph matches which
have fewer than the minimum number of atoms are discarded.  By
default, the minimum number of atoms of a subgraph match is one.
