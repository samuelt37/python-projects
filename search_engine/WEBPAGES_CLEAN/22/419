  Software process models often represent a networked sequence of activities, objects, transformations, and events that embody strategies for accomplishing software evolution.  

 Such models can be used to develop  more precise and formalized  descriptions of software life cycle activities.  

 Their power emerges from their utilization of a sufficiently rich notation, syntax, or semantics, often  suitable for computational processing .
