       Recent advances in technologies to
				capture, represent, transmit, disseminate, and visualize large
				volumes of multimedia information has truly revolutionized how
				people communicate and interact with each other. The impact cuts
				across a variety of new (and old) application domains ranging
				from internet chat rooms, to online virtual cyber societies, to
				entertainment – music, movies, games, to online classrooms
				and distance education. For example, in the context of distance
				education, high quality video lectures synchronized with power
				point presentations and accompanying lecture notes and online
				text/manuals allow students to explore the subject at their own
				pace and leisure in the comfort of their own surroundings. Such
				advances present unprecedented opportunities to society, the
				potential of which will be realized by the generations to follow. 
				 An important aspect in the evolution
				of the information society is that of “ universal access ”
				that supports mechanisms to bring the benefits of the information
				age to the disabled and the elderly.  
      This
      is supported by the current legislation via ADA and rehabilitation laws.   
                     
      The SUGA project focuses on the development of middleware techniques to
      support cross-disability access to multimedia content. To date,
      application developers and service providers have focused on extensive
      functionality and optimal performance (possibly, driven by commercial
      needs) to ensure that customers can be delivered the best possible Quality
      of Service (QoS) with the least possible resource consumption overhead.  SUGA  
      in Sanskrit means  'easy access' . Hence the goal of this project is
      to enhance information technology infrastructures to account for user
      abilities (and disabilities) so that personalized content can be delivered
      in a cost-effective manner.

				               Often times the zeal to exploit the emerging technologies to improve user
      experience ignores the goal of � universal access � to one and
      all. For example, increased network bandwidth and real-time video capture
      technologies may prompt transmission of a live event using streaming video
      but such a media is of little use to the blind. A case can also be made
      from an economic perspective as to why universal access is an important
      step in promoting the information economy. Perhaps it is the impaired,
      disabled and the aged that can benefit the most from the emergent
      technologies. Providing universal access in the distributed information
      environment requires an end-to-end approach, the realization of which
      requires advances in many areas in computer and information sciences.
      First, the design of suitable user-interfaces and assistive devices is
      critical and has been the focus of study in several recent research
      projects. Second, the generalized representation of content to allow
      access by individuals with varying disabilities (cross-disability access)
      is an important issue. Third, the extraction and delivery of personalized
      content in a cost-effective manner represents a significant challenge. 
       
                 
      A major step in the realization of
				the “universal access” goal is that of a  content 
				 adaptation   framework  that supports personalized
				(cross-disability) access to information. Content adaptation
				refers (a) selection of appropriate modalities and (b)
                modification of the parameters of a specific modality (for
				instance, an image can be encoded using various resolutions,
				color levels and intensities) in order to enhance usability and
				manage heterogeneity.  In order that the adaptation is
      effective it is essential to characterize the accessibility of information
      for a user given his/her ability disability characteristics. We use
      studies from cognitive sciences and models of human faculty to
      characterize the ability requirements of users given the disability
      profile and to quantify the accessibility of a given modality to the user.
      Using the ability based characterization we develop algorithms to select
      the best content to the users and to adapt the selected content for
      vision, motor and cognitive impairments.   
				 
				           
                There are multiple facets to
				developing such a framework foremost of which is a generalized
				representation of content to allow access to individuals with
				varying disabilities. The SUGA Project takes the approach that a
				cost-effective solution can be realized by offering the
				adaptation as a service within the distributed system middleware.
                We explore adaptive middleware
				techniques for the representation, storage, delivery and
				presentation of multimedia content for cross-disability access.
				Specifically, we focus on content adaptation and transcoding
				technologies to achieve a balance between end-user’s goal
				of  QoS satisfaction and the service provider’s goal
				of optimal resource consumption. Content adaptation may be
				carried out anywhere along the datapath - at the server, client
				or at intermediate proxies.
