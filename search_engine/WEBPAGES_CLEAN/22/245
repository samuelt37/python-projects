                 2005 Harvest Crusade </strong>     Make sure to watch the  live webcasts  from July 15-17. Or better yet, come to Angel Stadium in person (come early, because the stadium gets packed early). Here is the musical lineup:   Friday</strong>: Delirious?, Casting Crowns  Saturday</strong>: Toby Mac, Jeremy Camp, Kutless  Sunday</strong>: Steven Curtis Chapman, Jars of Clay, Crystal Lewis  BTW, if you want a recap of the historic Billy Graham crusade in New York last month, go  here . About 1/4 of a million people came out for that event.   Update:</strong> View the  Archived Webcasts  -- Saturday night was especially good with Jeremy Camp and Toby.
