Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together 
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles?  For instance you can pack 
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon.  It turns 
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions.  We describe connections 
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra, 
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher.
