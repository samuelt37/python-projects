        	     Software and Datasets  
                 
                      When I first started my career, there were no public software repositories like Github. Nowadays it is becoming more and more common to host and maintain code and software on Github, or similar repositories. As time goes by, I plan to improve and update my Github presence and link the available software on here. My (currently in development) Github repositories can be accessed    here     .
                
              Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you need access to code and datasets from any of my publications.  In some cases, I may need to require some polishing
