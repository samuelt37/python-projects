  Results for Marginals Solvers: Exact Track 
   The following solvers participated in the Exact Marginals evaluation:        Hugin (Hugin)     Accepts only Bayesian networks     Evaluated double-precision and single-precision solvers       Ace (UCLA)     Accepts all network types       SMILE (UPitt)     Accepts only Bayesian networks          In the following we give three sets of plots depicting two measures:         Cumulative time as a function of number of instances solved (which we call "cumulative score"): compares the cumulative time &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt; it takes to solve the first &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt; fastest instances. (2 sets of plots)       Number of instances solved over time: illustrates the number of instances solved, &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt;, by time &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt;.         These measures are described in more detail below.             
  Instances Solved vs Cumulative Time 
     These plots illustrate simultaneously how many instances a solver can solve, and how quickly it solves them.  For each solver, we sort its solved instances by the time it took to solve them.  Consider the following, which plots the performance of a single solver.                
         At a point &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt; gives us the cumulative time that a solver took to solve its first &lt;&lt;latex: execution failed [28] (see also the log)&gt;&gt; fastest instances.  From left-to-right, we can gauge the relative difficulty of instances for this particular solver, on this particular benchmark.  More specifically, we see that many instances are relatively easy (solved quickly), where a fraction of the most difficult instances required the majority of the solver's time.       In these plots, given below, the further right a solver reaches (more instances solved), and closer to the x-axis a solver is (faster), the better it is considered to perform.  Note that instances are sorted by time for a solver, independently of the other solvers.  That is, easy instances of one solver are not necessarily easy instances for another solver.       Plots are in tabular form. Each row corresponds to a set of benchmarks.  The first column corresponds to a linear y-axis plot, whereas the second column corresponds to a log y-axis plot.  Differences between solvers are more visible in the log plot.          Exact MAR: Instances Solved vs. Cumulative Time Results          For convenience, the following plots are equivalent to the above linear y-axis plots, at a larger scale.

  Number of instances solved over time 
     In these plots, given below, we plot for each exact solver, the number of instances solved as a function of time (with a limit of 20 minutes).  For example, the following plots performance over all benchmarks.                
         Note that the above plot does not take into account the vastly differing number of benchmark set sizes as well as the fact that some solvers do not solve Markov networks.
