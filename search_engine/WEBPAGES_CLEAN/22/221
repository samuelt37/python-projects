  HalfedgeDSHalfedge  


  
 

  Definition 
 

The concept   HalfedgeDSHalfedge   defines the requirements for the local  Halfedge  
type in the   HalfedgeDS   concept. It is also required in 
the  Halfedge_wrapper&lt;Refs,Traits&gt;  member class template of an
items class, see the   HalfedgeDSItems   concept.
  

A halfedge is an oriented edge between two vertices. It is always
paired with a halfedge pointing in the  opposite  direction. The
  opposite ()  member function returns this halfedge of  opposite 
 orientation . The  next()  member function points to the  successor 
halfedge along the face - or if the halfedge is a border halfedge -
along the open region. A halfedge optionally stores a reference to the
previous halfedge along the face, a reference to an incident vertex,
and a reference to an incident face. Type tags indicate whether the
related member functions are supported.

depicts the relationship between a halfedge and its incident
halfedges, vertices, and faces.

          are optionally supported.
     
 

For the protection of the integrity of the data structure classes such
as   CGAL::Polyhedron_3   are allowed to redefine the modifying member
functions to be private. In order to make them accessible for the
halfedge data structure they must be derived from a base class
 Base  where the modifying member functions are still public. Even
more protection is provided for the  set_opposite()  member
function. The base class  Base_base  provides access to it.  (The
protection could be bypassed also by an user, but not by accident.)
