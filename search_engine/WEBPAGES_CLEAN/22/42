				I'm a third year doctoral student studying statistics at the University of California, Irvine working under the advisement of Dr. Hal Stern.  My research interests are in Bayesian inference and statistical machine learning techniques, specifically in applied settings. My recent work has focused on understanding human behavior using techniques from Information Theory and Causal Statistics.  I am also passionate about statistical computing and data visualization.
