  Retrieving properties (cont�d)  
      Recommended solution
 
   change name of SEARCH to PROPGET (or GETPROP or FINDPROP), reserving SEARCH for a more full-powered search facility
  limit the capabilities of PROPGET to retrieving only named properties
  support only a wildcard �*� so that all properties on a resource are retrieved
  helpful if the client doesn�t know the name of all properties defined on the resource
         A separate WG will address full-featured search
