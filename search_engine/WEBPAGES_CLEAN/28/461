 CS 261, Spring 2013, Homework 7, Due Thursday, May 30


1. The standard deviation of a collection of n data values x_i may be
calculated by the formula

          n sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2
s = sqrt( -------------------------- ).
                  n (n-1)

(a) Give an example that shows that the standard deviation is not
decomposable.

(b) Describe a decomposable range querying problem such that the
standard deviation of the data values within a query range can be
computed in constant time from the answer to your query.
(We went through a similar example for the average in the lecture.)


2. In class we saw how to compute the average of any contiguous subarray
of a one-dimensional matrix by looking up two sums of prefixes of the
matrix. Suppose that we have a two-dimensional matrix A (such as the
pixels in a grayscale image), and we store another matrix B of the same
dimensions, such that the value in B[i,j] is the sum of all entries
A[x,y] with 0
