class OEQMolBase : public OEMolBase
    
OEQMolBase is an abstract class that extends OEMolBase and provides
facilities useful in graph matching.  Query molecules are used in
matching operations such as substructure search, clique detection, and
maximum common substructure search.  Query expressions
(Section  3.9 ) stored in query atoms and query bonds are
used to represent the boolean logic used in graph matching operations.
Query molecules conveniently collect query atoms and query bonds into
a molecule suitable for use as a query graph in matching operations.
As a derived type of OEMolBase, query molecules are valid arguments
for functions which take a base molecule class as an argument.
