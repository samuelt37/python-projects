       Course Description 
       One of the main challenges in building intelligent systems is
the ability to reason under uncertainty, and one of the most successful
approaches for dealing with this challenge is based on the framework of
Bayesian networks, also called graphical models. Intelligent systems
based on Bayesian networks are being used in a variety of real-world
applications including diagnosis, sensor fusion, on-line help systems,
credit assessment, bioinformatics and data mining.  
       The objective of this class is to provide an in-depth
exposition of knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty
using the framework of Bayesian networks.  Both theoretical
underpinnings and practical considerations will be covered, with a
special emphasis on dependency and independency models, on augmenting
probablistic networks with constraints and on exact and approximate
probabilistic reasoning algorithms. Additional topics include: causal
networks, first-order probablistic languages and dynamic Bayesian
networks.  
       
        
       Prerequisites 
       
        Familiarity with basic concepts of probability theory.  
         Knowledge of basic computer science, algorithms and programming principles.  
         Previous exposure to AI is desirable but not essential.
