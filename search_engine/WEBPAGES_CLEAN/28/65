 Succinct Convex Greedy Drawing of 3-Connected Plane Graphs 
 Lowell Trott 

 The authors show that the classical Schnyder drawing in
 R  2  of 3-connected plane graphs is weakly greedy with
respect to a metric function H(*,*).  The drawing is planar,
convex, and succinct, using two integer coordinates between 0 and
 f , where  f  is the number of internal faces of the graph. 

 (Based on a paper by He and Zhang to appear at SODA 2011.)
