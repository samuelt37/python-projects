     A New Perspective on Algorithms for Optimizing Policies Under Uncertainty 
 Rina Dechter ( dechter@ics.uci.edu ) 
 
 Abstract  
The paper takes a fresh look at algorithms for maximizing 
expected utility over a set of policies, that is, a
set of possible ways of reacting to observations about
an uncertain state of the world. Using the bucket-
elimination framework, we characterize the complexity
of this optimization task by graph-based parameters,
and devise an improved variant of existing algorithms.
The improvement is shown to yield a dramatic gain in
complexity when the probabilistic subgraph (of the influence diagram)
is sparse, regardless of the complexity
introduced by its utility subgraph.
