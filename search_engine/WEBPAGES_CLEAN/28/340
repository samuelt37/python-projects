                  Marian Petre visit   
                                  
             
			
			 
				 Our long-term collaborator Marian Petre from The Open University visited us for this week, working on finalizing a book to be published out of the SPSD 2010 workshop (it is almost done!), and providing us with feedback on Nick Mangano’s work on analyzing sketches on whiteboards.  Her insights are always much appreciated and we already look forward to her next visit!
