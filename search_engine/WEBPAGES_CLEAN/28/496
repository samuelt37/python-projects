Finding an Optimal Path without Growing the Tree

Abstract: 
   It is well known that any algorithm to compute the shortest path  
   between any two vertices in a graph must take the same asymptotic time
   as an algorithm that computers a single-source all-destinations tree.
   But space complexity is another matter.
   The authors develop an algorithm paradigm for reporting an optimal
   path between two vertices without growing an entire single-source
   all-destinations tree. This brings forth a new technique, prune and
   search, and a new data structure, the clipped tree.
   These are used to improve the space bounds on previously best known
   algorithms.
