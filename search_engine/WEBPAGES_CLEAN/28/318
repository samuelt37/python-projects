   A disk-packing algorithm for an origami magic trick .  M. Bern ,

D. Eppstein, and
B. Hayes.   Int. Conf. Fun with
Algorithms , Elba, June 1998. 
Proceedings in Informatics 4, Carleton Scientific, Waterloo, Canada, 1999,

We apply techniques from " Quadrilateral meshing
by circle packing " to a magic trick of Houdini:
fold a piece of paper so that with one straight cut, you can form your
favorite polygon.
