    Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science 
    The Doctoral Program in Information and Computer Science is a research-based curriculum in which students work together with faculty to solve advanced problems. The program is designed to prepare professors and researchers for positions in universities, industry, and government. 
 The Ph.D. degree in Information and Computer Science has a concentration in one of the following six areas:  

  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
 Computer Systems Design (CSD)  
 Computer Systems and Networks (CSN)  
 Computers, Organizations, Policy, and Society (CORPS)  
 Software (SW)  
 Algorithms and Data Structures (Theory)     
 Additionally, an area of specialization other than one of these concentrations may be chosen with the approval of the graduate advisor. This is particularly useful in the emerging fields of medical informatics or bioinformatics and information access and in areas of recent growth within ICs (computer graphics and computer security). 

 There are many opportunities available for financial support for Ph.D. students, including 20 fellowships with full tuition and a monthly stipend supported by the U.S. Department of Education's Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program, several chancellors fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistant positions.
