Authenticated Data Structures for Graph and Geometric Searching
 
  Lowell Trott  
 
Authenticated data structures provide cryptographic proofs that their
answers are as accurate as the author intended, even if the data
structure is maintained by a remote host. We present techniques for
authenticating data structures that represent graphs and collections of
geometric objects. In our model, a data structure maintained by a
trusted source is mirrored at distributed directories that answer
queries and provide proof of correctness. Our work has applications to
the authentication of network management systems and geographic
information systems.
