Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis , Irvine, 2003.   Discrete Applied Mathematics  156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008 .
 
Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
 medium , a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

    The lattice dimension of a graph.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0402028 .   Eur. J. Combinatorics  26 (6): 585–592, 2005 .
 
Describes a polynomial time algorithm for isometrically embedding graphs
into an integer lattice of the smallest
possible dimension.  The technique involves
 maximum matching 
in an auxiliary graph derived from a
 partial cube  representation of the input.

    Algorithms for drawing media.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0406020 .  12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , New York, 2004. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3383, 2004, pp. 173–183.
 
We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
 partial cubes :
one based on
 finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph  and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.
  
Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book  Media Theory , making journal publication moot.

    Cubic partial cubes from simplicial arrangements.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/0510263 .   Electronic
J. Combinatorics  13(1) #R79, 2006 .
 
We show how to construct a cubic partial cube from any simplicial
arrangement of lines or pseudolines in the projective plane. As a
consequence, we find nine new infinite families of cubic partial cubes
as well as many sporadic examples.
  
    Upright-quad drawing of st-planar learning spaces.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0607094 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 282–293 .   J. Graph Algorithms and Applications  12 (1): 51–72 , 2008 (special
issue for GD'06).
 
We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

    Happy endings for flip graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0610092 .  23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.   J. Computational Geometry  1 (1): 3–28, 2010 .
 
We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.
  
    Manhattan orbifolds.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.MG/0612109 .   Topology and
its Applications  157 (2): 494–507, 2009 .
 
We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

We describe tests for whether the union-closure of a set family is
well-graded, and algorithms for finding a minimal well-graded
union-closed superfamily of a given set family.
  
    Recognizing partial cubes in quadratic time . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0705.1025 .  19th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
San Francisco, 2008, pp. 1258–1266.   J. Graph
    Algorithms and Applications  15 (2): 269–293, 2011 .
 
We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a  hypercube , in time
O(n 2 ), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from " algorithms for media ".

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including " Algorithms for Media ", " Algorithms for Drawing Media ", " Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces ", and
" The Lattice Dimension of a Graph ".

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 384–389.  
We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be
isometrically embedded into Cartesian products of five (but not, in
general, fewer than five) trees.

Algorithms and Applications  15 (4): 551–564, 2011 .
 
We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper  Algorithms for Drawing Media . Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

 V. Chepoi ,

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L 1  plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

 Erratum (with V. Wiechert) .
 
We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial
order should have a pair of items that are nearly equally likely to
appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

We show how to represent a learning space by a small family of learning
sequences, orderings of the items in a learning sequence that are
consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge
states and the efficient assessment of the state of knowledge of a human
learner.

In another chapter of the same book we used learning sequences to
represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of
a human learning. In this chapter we show how to use the same data
structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger
learning space (an important subroutine in knowledge assessment) and to
modify a learning space to more accurately model students.
