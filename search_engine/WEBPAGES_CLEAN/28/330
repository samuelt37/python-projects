 Mac Eclipse/C++ Installation

This is the accumulated wisdom I have about installing on Macs.

----------

  Mostly, I have copied/pasted Daniel Acevedo's Post
  "Guide to Succesfully Install Eclipse on Mac"...
  but I have also added a few other hints from the TA
  who said most students going to Lab today seemed to
  get it running (and most who Daniel helped outside my
  office hours on Wednesday did).

  I don't have a good feeling for those students who got
  the courselib working, whether they got GoogleTest to
  work too.  For Program #1 you don't need GoogleTest working, 
  but you will need  it for all later programs.

ECLIPSE:

This is the setup I found to work best to get Eclipse working perfectly on my
Mac machine. As a note, I am using Mavericks.

The first thing you want to do is download "Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers"
(http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/keplersr1)
and choose the "Mac OS X(Cocoa 64)" download link on the right-hand side of the
page.

After successfully downloading Eclipse, you must download Xcode
(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Note that Xcode may
take a while to download onto your computer, especially depending on your
internet speed. NOTE: You MUST have the latest version of Xcode (Xcode 5) in
order for this to properly work.

Now, open up Terminal. Type in (don't copy/paste) "xcode-select --install"
(yet xcode-select followed by the switch --install).

Now, open up Eclipse. Under "Eclipse", open up "Preferences". Under the
"General" tab, click "Workspace". Under "Text file encoding", switch from
Default (MacRoman) to Other, and pick "UTF-8" from the drop-down list. Click
Apply.

Under the "New C/C++ Project Wizard" tab, look at the list under "Project
type:" Under the "Executable" tab, highlight "Empty Project". Now, look to your
right. Under the "Toolchains" list, highlight "MacOSX GCC". Now, underneath
that list, click on the "Make toolchain(s) preferred" button. Click Apply.

You can now test if you have set everything up correctly:

Create a new C++ Project. Call the Project name whatever you'd like. If you
have successfully done the above parts, you can just name it and click "Finish"
at the bottom right.

Highlight the project you just created. Right click it, click "New", and select
"Source File". When the prompt shows up, enter in a Source file name, and click
finish. Copy and paste the following code into the project to check that
everything worked:

#include 

int main()
{
      std::cout
