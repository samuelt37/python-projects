  PROPPATCH Method - Implementation  
      Two Commands
 
  PROPPATCH supports creating or deleting a property. In order to simplify the implementation and reduce server load there are no facilities to alter part of a propertyï¿½s value.
       Batching and Atomicity
 
  Multiple create/delete commands may be sent in a single PROPPATCH, all MUST be executed in order and atomically or the entire request MUST be rejected.
