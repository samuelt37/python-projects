   Is there a theory explaining the symmetry groups a polyhedron-with-holes
(or other surface imbedded or immersed in R^3) is allowed to have?
I mean symmetries derived from rotations or isometries of R^3, not
diffeomorphisms etc.

  For instance, with tetrahedral symmetry I can make a surface with
genus 3A+8B, for any A and B, by starting from a regular tetrahedron
and performing A alternations of drilling four holes meeting in the
center or building four handles meeting at the center, and by repeating
B times making a Y-shaped hole near each of the four vertices.

  So, this only leaves out genus 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 13.  Are any of
these possible?  I can also immerse a genus-four manifold with
tetrahedral symmetry (imagine holes running from each vertex of a
tetrahedron to the opposite face) and this also leads to immersions of
genus 7, 10, 13 but not 1, 2, or 5.

   You might have more luck in higher dimensions. For example,
the torus S1 x S1 sits in complex 2-dimensional space and
has a two dimensional group of symmetries. You can also
embed the torus in various ways in complex projective spaces
of dimensions 2,3,4,... as the "elliptic normal curve"
so as to be invariant under a group of order 2*n^2, n-1  being
the dimension of the projective space. You can probably easily
get a triangulation invariant under that group.

   As an addendum to my earlier message, tetrahedrally symmetric polyhedra
can also achieve genus 5: drill holes from the middle of each edge,
meeting in the center.  Combining this with the other operations also
gives genus 13.  7 is possible by drilling holes from the vertices and faces,
all meeting together at the center. I still don't know how to do 1, 2, and 10.
