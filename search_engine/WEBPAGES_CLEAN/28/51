     Bucket Elimination: a Unifying Framework for
Processing Hard and Soft Constraints

 Abstract  
The Constraint Satisfaction framework is quite restricted. Nevertheless, it is
this restrictiveness that allowed the developments of very useful concepts such
as constraint propagation (also know as "consistency enforcement"), through
which various tractable subclasses had emerged and by which general purpose
algorithms such as backtracking were improved [8,6,7,2]. However, real life
problems frequently call for extending the basic model to allow nondeterminism
as the representation of preferences among solutions. Such extensions relate the
CSP model to known models for combinatorial optimization developed in the
Operation Research community as well as to more recent frameworks such as
Probabilistic Networks [9]. 
In this note I argue that extending the CSP model to a richer set of tasks can
be done elegantly using a unifying framework which I call "bucket elimination".
I believe that this framework will allow hybrids of two fundamental problem
solving paradigms: elimination and conditioning, will address computational
issues such as time-space tradeoffs, and will allow developing approximation
algorithms, all within this general, and therefore, widely applicable framework.
In the rest of this note I outline the basic framework.
