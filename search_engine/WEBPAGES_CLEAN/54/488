I think the working group has to agree that it's a "work item" before
it becomes a working group submission. And there's a lot of resistance
to getting HTTP-WG to do new things when they still have unfinished
old business. So, I suggest making it an individual submission. If
you're really just doing conventions for URL syntax, it might not even
belong in HTTP; a separate smaller "working group" would be called
for, then.

Worry about content, not structure.
