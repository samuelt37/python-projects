 ICS 21 Winter 2012 
Course Schedule 
 

 
 Introduction to Computer Science I 
Norman Jacobson, Instructor 
 
 

 This course schedule gives lecture topics and associated readings, sample programs and programming practice problems, the suggested times by which to start lab assignments, the dates of the various exams, and when partner formations should occur and when partner evaluations are due. Readings  in italics  are found in the on-line (Web-based) Wiley-Plus version of the text (see the Course Reference, textbook section, for more details on the various versions of the text). "CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java...[the] problems give immediate feedback, so it's an opportunity to practice and solidify understanding..." [codingbat.com/java]. ...and strictly optional; do them as you find helpful to your study of course material. 

 Well stick to this schedule as closely as is
reasonable, and announce any changes circumstances warrant.
