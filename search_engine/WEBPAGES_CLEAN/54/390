    CS 295: UCI Programming Languages Seminar     

   Fall, 2011 (Tuesday
5:00-7:00pm, CS 432)   
   Co-instructors :  Michael Franz  (CS),  Brian Demsky  (EECS), and  Harry Xu  (CS)  

   Brief Introduction:   
 This is a paper reading class co-taught by the three
programming languages professors at UCI. We welcome all students 
interested in doing research on programming languages and software
systems to join the class. The schedule for this  class is on a
per-quarter-basis. For the current (Fall 2011) quarter, we will be
reading and discussing some of the best  papers in  the
20 years of PLDI . Please email any one of us if you have a
question.

    Announcement:   
Starting from 10/11, we will meet at  CS 432  instead of Bren 1422.

 Note:  ACM
SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation
(PLDI)  is a flagship  conference in the area of programming
languages and software systems, and is actually one of the  best
conferences   in all computer science disciplines.
