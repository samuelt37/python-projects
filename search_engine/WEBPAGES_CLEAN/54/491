    Setting parameters by example . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/9907001 .   40th
IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci. , 1999, pp. 309–318 .  
 SIAM J. Computing  32 (3): 643–653, 2003 .
 
We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
 low-dimensional linear programming 
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
 minimum spanning trees ,
 shortest paths , and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

We prove the existence of polyhedra in which all faces are convex,
but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.
  
Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable
polyhedra with triangular faces". The journal version uses the title
"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and
the combined results from both conference versions.

    Small maximal independent sets and faster exact graph coloring .

We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.
 
We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis , Irvine, 2003.   Discrete Applied Mathematics  156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008 .
 
Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
 medium , a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

    Dynamic generators of topologically embedded graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0207082 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 599–608 .
 
We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

    Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212007 .  
 19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281 .
 
We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We describe a new method of
 drawing graphs , based on allowing the edges to
be merged together and drawn as "tracks" (similar to train tracks).
We present heuristics for finding such drawings
based on my previous  algorithms
for finding maximal bipartite subgraphs , prove that several
important families of graphs have confluent drawings, and provide
examples of other graphs that can not be drawn in this way.

We show it is possible to
 triangulate  three-dimensional space using only
tetrahedra with acute dihedral angles. We present several constructions
to achieve this, including one in which all dihedral angles are less
than 77.08 degrees, and another which tiles a slab in space.

    Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0304018 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006 .
 
We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 
  
The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

    Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0307023 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .
