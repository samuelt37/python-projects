 ICS 261, Winter 2006: 
Data Structures 

 This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
3:00 - 3:50 in PSCB 230.
The text is "Introduction to
Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, however the
lectures will also cover additional material not in that text.
Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (25%), a midterm (30%),
and a comprehensive final exam (45%). 

 Homeworks will be assigned on Wednesdays, due in class the following Monday.
Due to lack of teaching assistance for graduate classes, we will be
employing the following homework grading policy: you must be present in
class Monday for your homework to be scored. At the start of the
lecture, I will go over the answers to the homeworks together with a
scoring rubric, and each student will grade his or her own homework
according to the rubric. I will then collect and record the graded
homeworks.
