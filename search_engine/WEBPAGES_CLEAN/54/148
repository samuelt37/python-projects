 Computer Law Seminar Readings  
  
 This list of assigned readings will grow as
the quarter progresses. In particular, look for the appearance of items
marked as 
 
 (April 18) and 
 
 (April 29).    
 
 Many of these materials were written for lawyers,
which means they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring them to class
so I can (try to) clarify them.   
 
 The paper-based references will be available
in the ICS grad course materials file (the upper left drawer in the filing
cabinet outside the ICS kitchen).  If an entry below doesn't contain
a URL or some other indication of its source, the cabinet is where you'll
find it.  
 
The April 29 materials are listed below by topic; they are all collected
together in the filing cabinet, however, for ease of retrieval.

  Computer Law--General   
    
 A good overview of how lawyers think about
computer law issues can be found in the on-line course,   Cyberspace Law for Non-Laywers . 
 The authors (Larry Lessig, David Post, and Eugene Volokh) give a concise
and well-reasoned overview of many computer law issues from an authoritative
perspective.  This is a valuable perspective even though it's over five
yeas old; you just shouldn't rely on it for the precise status of the
law today, since many of the issues have evolved since then.  
   
 There are good, short, reasonably current
overviews of many legal topics at  http://www.findlaw.com 
.  
   
   Ian C. Ballon, "Internet and E-Commerce
Law -- 2002."  This is a lengthy outline that gives the recent status
of most computer law issues.  I'd suggest referring back to it as we
touch on each new topic (or using it for pointers to your project topic).  
    
  Intellectual Property--Patent   
    
   Patent sources and references [for reference,
not an assignment]  
    
 U. S. Patent and Trademark Office:   http://www.uspto.gov/

 USPTO examiners' guidelines for computer-related
inventions:   http://www.uspto.gov /web/offices/com/hearings/software/analysis/computer.html  
    
   Alison E. Cantor, "Using the Written
Description and Enablement Requirements to Limit Biotechnology Patents."  
   
  Eli A. Loots, "The 2001 USPTO Written
Description Guidelines and Gene Claims."  This isn't required;
it's just there for those with an interest in biotechnology.  
   
  Tiffany Weeks, "Amazon.com v. BarnesandNoble.com,
Inc."  This describes Amazon.com's attempt to use its "one-click"
patent to prevent Barnes andNoble from doing something similar on their
web site.    
    
  Intellectual Property--Copyright   
    
   Ian C. Ballon, "Bots, Screen Scraping,
Content Aggregation and the Evolving Doctrine of Database Trespass."  
   
  Lisa M. Zepeda, "A&amp;M Records, Inc.
v. Napster, Inc."  This describes the case that shut Napster down.  
   
  Note, "Felten v. Recording Industry Association
Of America, Inc."  This brief note describes the disposition of Edward
Felten's suit to invalidate part of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which wasn't decided on first amendment grounds.  
    
  Intellectual Property--Trade Secret and
Trademark   
    
   Trade Secret Home Page 
has a variety of trade secret information [for reference, not an assignment]  
   
  Jian Xiao, "The First Wave of Cases under
the ACPA."  The Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act prevents
opportunistic exploitation of trademarked domain names.  
   
  Danielle Pasqualone, "GlobeSpan, Inc.
v. O'Neill."  The author argues for preserving a trade secret law
doctrine that's is in tension with the public policy decision to favor
employee mobility.  
    
  Jurisdiction in Cyberspace   
    
  Sonal N. Mehta, "Pavlovich v. Superior
Court of Santa Clara County."  If you live in California and maintain
there a web site that somehow violates Mississippi law, can Mississippi
prosecute you for it?  That's the cyberspace jurisdiction question,
which this article discusses.  
   
  Christine Duh, "Yahoo! Inc. v. LICRA."
 This article addresses international jurisdiction issues.  
    
  Contracts   
    
  Ryan J. Casamiquela, "Contractual Assent
and Enforceability in Cyberspace."  This article discusses "click-wrap"
licenses  
    
  Privacy   
    
  Laura Quilter, "The Continuing Expansion
of Cyberspace Trespass to Chattels."  One method of curtailing Email
spam is to apply the law of trespass in cyberspace.  
   
  Note, "Kyllo v. United States."
 This brief note covers the thermal imaging case (where law enforcement
detected marijuana plants using a device that read unusual heat patterns
from outside the house where the plants were grown).  
    
  Computer Crime   
    
   California Penal Code sec. 502 and 502.01 
(the California computer crime law).  You'll have to scroll down the
page to find these sections.
