Uses a divide and conquer on the edge set of a graph, together with the
idea of replacing subgraphs by sparser certificates, to make various
dynamic algorithms as fast on dense graphs as they are on sparse graphs.
Applications include random generation of spanning trees
as well as finding the  k 
 minimum weight spanning trees 
for a given parameter  k.
