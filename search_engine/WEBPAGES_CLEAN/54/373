 Gliders in "Life"-Like Cellular Automata<body>
     
        Which "Life"-Like Systems Have Gliders?  
     

       John
    Conway's "Game of Life"  has fascinated and inspired many
    enthusiasts, due to the emergence of complex behavior from a
    very simple system. One of the many interesting phenomena in
    life is the existence of "gliders": small patterns that move
    across the grid. Some authors have asserted that the gliders
    and other complex behaviors occurring in Life are unusual, for
    instance Wolfram: "Except for a few simple variants on the Game
    of Life, no other definite  class-4 
    two-dimensional cellular automata were found in a random sample
    of several thousand outer totalistic rules." Are gliders really
    so rare?  

      I have investigated whether gliders exist in many  semitotalistic rules  similar to Life,
    where the behavior of a cell depends only on its own state and
    the number of live neighbors. The results show that the
    existence of gliders is commonplace, contradicting Wolfram and
     calling into question his classification
    of cellular automata .
