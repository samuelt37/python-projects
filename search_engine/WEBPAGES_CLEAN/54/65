 Table of contents 
   Default actions 
   Enable diag actions 
   Script actions 
   Cookbook actions 
   
 Page actions are applied to wiki pages, as a  query string  appended to the  URL .
 Security  can be applied to all  default actions , and  script actions  with one exception, but not  diag actions , through the use of  passwords .
 
 Also documented are all other URL queries.
 
  NOTE:</strong> All actions will be disabled if the following is set:
 
   
    $EnableActions = 0;
    include('pmwiki.php');
 
 This will initialize PmWiki (along with any configuration/customizations
that are being made, e.g. from local/config.php), but won't actually
perform any actions.  The caller can then call the desired action
or other functions as desired. This is available from  Version 2.2.0-beta22  on up.
