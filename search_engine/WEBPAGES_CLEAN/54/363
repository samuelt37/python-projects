We need to stick to our guns: make a simple version extention to URLs
and make them standard.

&gt;&gt; The point is: you can't tell the relationship between address A1
&gt;&gt; and address A2 just by looking at their syntax: you need explicit
&gt;&gt; information that says one is a version of the other. The Resource
&gt;&gt; element is one such syntax.
&gt;
&gt;Separate out the problem of
&gt;  a) construct a URL for a previous version of a resource
&gt;     given the current version of a resource and information
&gt;     about the server's versioning system
&gt;  b) determining from two URLs what their version relationship
&gt;     might be.
&gt;
&gt;I think it's reasonable to use URL-decoration for (a) and not for (b).
&gt;
&gt;Maybe it's OK if the only way you can accomplish (b) is to retrieve
&gt;attributes of the actual resources, and not their URLs.

Fair enough. ?version=xxx seems reasonable for (a)
