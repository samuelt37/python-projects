 Abstract 

 Motivated by the problem of labeling maps, we investiage the
problem of computing a large non-intersecting subset in a set of n
rectangles in the plane. Our results are as follows. In O(n log n)
time, we can find an O(log n)-factor approximation of the maximum
subset in a set of n arbitrary axis-parallel rectangles in the
plane. If all rectangles have unit height, we can find a
2-approximation in O(n log n) time. Extending this result, we
obtain a (1 + 1/k)-approximation in time O(n log n + n^(2k-1))
time, for any integer k &gt;= 1.
