Teaching and learning are mirror

a book by Scott Kim.   
 
    
 
Students accepted to CMU would wear 
this badge when visiting the campus; I 
sometimes wore it too, because I  admit  
I'm still a student, learning new things.
 
       

I have put my collection of  
   Quotations for Learning and Programing 
  on the web.
I hope to continue expanding (and correcting) it.
I always welcome feedback (e.g., corrections, misattributions, other
quotations).

  

   

I am starting to index, annotate, and put on the web various
   Education-Related Video Clips .

For  Office Hours*  (with a  * : W 12pm-1pm)
  I will sometimes have to cancel because 
  of faculty meetings.
  I will send email that day if I cannot attend these office hours.

  

   Interesting Snippets 
While developing a manuscript for a textbook on the Ada programming language
  in the late 1980s, I wrote a chapter on 
     EBNF 
  and began teaching it on the "first" day of my CS-1 class: primarily as a
   microcosm of programming, but also as a practical tool for later describing
   the syntax of Ada.
These 21 pages (less than 1/4 the size of the original Karel book) discuss
  the sequence, choice, option, repetition, and recursion control structures
  (along with "procedural" abstracton via named EBNF rules).
They explore various methods of proving that tokens satisfy descriptions,
  that descriptions are equivalent (and how to simplify them), and the
  difference between syntax and semantics.
I have continued to use this approach until this day in my CS-1 classes.
In fact, I have rewritten this  EBNF  chapter for
  an introduction to Python course I am teaching.

   finish at the bottom of page 20: "...never thought that was possible.")
Explains why debugging is best accomplished by thinking, not fiddling.

  (up to connected components).
It is scary and compelling at the same time.

   Philosphical Musings 
Doubts are such tiny things.
A mind with no room for doubts
must have no room for thoughts either. -R. Pattis
 
   
The following dialog is from the transcript of "Between Time and Timbuktu"
  (a synthesis of the writings of Kurt Vonnegut).
For more on Bokononism, from which this passage is inspired, see
 
  The Books of Bokonon  (from the novel "Cat's Cradle").
  

Narrator:
  In the beginning, G-d created the Earth, and he said, "Let there be
    mud."
  And there was mud.
  And G-d said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud
    can see what We have done."
  And G-d created every living creature that now moveth, and one was
    man.
  Mud-as-man alone could speak.
  "What is the purpose of all this?" man asked politely.
  "Everything must have a purpose?" asked G-d.
  "Certainly," said man.
  Then I leave it up to you to think of one for all of this,"
    said G-d.
  And he went away.  
Stony Stevenson:
  I feel very unimportant compared to you [G-d].  
Voice of Bokonon:
  The only way you can feel the least bit important
    is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look
    around.  
Stony Stevenson:
  I got so much, and most mud got so little.
