  Discussion of Integration Strategies   
        All three approaches have merits and shortcomings

 

         �Straight� UML

 

      understandable architectures

  manipulable by standard tools

  architectural constraint violations

         �Constrained� UML

 

      ensures architectural constraints

  requires complete style specifications

  requires OCL-compliant tools

         �Extended� UML

 

      provides �native� support for architectures

  requires backward tool compatibility

  may result in incompatible UML versions
