The latter example was taken from (Wahba, 1990) using the function f(x) = 4.26(e -x -4e -2x +3e -3x ) such that y i = f(x i )+e i 21 for all i = 1, . . . , N . The random white noise       Stephen D.

With this method they were able to improve performance on 7 of 10 domains tested (7 from the UCI repository and 3 proprietary  cloud  classification datasets), and they noted that ECOC accuracy gains tended to increase with increased diversity among the features selected for the two-class problems.
