       2012-13 Butterworth Fellow 
 


 

        John Brock 
                     John Brock has been awarded the inaugural Butterworth Recruitment Fellowship, offered to outstanding entering Ph.D. students. The fellowship is named for Bren School alumnus Paul Butterworth (B.S. '74, M.S. '81), chief technical officer of AccessG2 and sponsor of the school's annual
    Butterworth Product Development Competition . 
 


 

       Where are you from? 
                          I grew up in Oceanport, N.J.  What are your previous academic degrees? 
                          B.A. in computer science from Boston University.  Why did you choose to pursue graduate studies at UCI? 
                          First, UCI's machine learning people are some of the best in the world. Second, I'm less interested in pure theory than in applied research that can make real impacts in people's lives; I found many researchers at UCI to be kindred spirits in this regard. Lastly, there are a lot of opportunities for interdisciplinary research – for example, I've recently been meeting with some UCI Earth science researchers to discuss potential collaborations.  What is your current research focus? 
                          I'm in the process of narrowing my focus, but I'm primarily interested in applied machine learning and computing in developing countries.  What are your future plans? 
                          I want to be wherever there are smart people working on interesting problems and getting things done.  How do you like to spend your time outside of school? 
                          I just moved here from out of state, so I spend most of my free time exploring the area and trying to take advantage of everything Southern California has to offer. As far as hobbies go, I love board games, photography, hiking, and cooking.   Any words of wisdom for prospective grad students looking to study at UCI? 
                          The people are what make UCI great. Every day I feel lucky to work with so many talented, smart, and friendly individuals.
