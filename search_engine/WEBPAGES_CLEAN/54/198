Game mechanics      
Game mechanics are a construct of elements and rules intended to produce an enjoyable game, such as       Turns:  a segment of the game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn      Action points:  what players may do on their turns is influenced by a budget of “action points” they get.      Bidding:  players make competitive bids to determine who may perform particular actions      Capture/Eliminate:  the number of tokens a player owns is related to his current strength in the game      Movement:  governs how tokens are allowed to move, and when     
       Gaming-specific      (?)       guidelines        Game Mechanics should feel natural and have correct weight (Desurvire 2004)   
    
 Game should
react in a consistent, challenging, and exciting way to the player’s
actions, e.g., have appropriate music with the action (Desurvire 2004)   
    
 Make effects of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) clearly visible to the player by ensuring they are consistent with the   player’s reasonable expectations of the AI actor (Desurvire 2004)   
  
 Instantiations of more general HCI guidelines       

Feedback should be given immediately to display user control (Bickford 1997, Malone 1982, Sanchez-Crespo 1999)       
     Get the player involved quickly and easily (Bickford, 1997)   

    
 Mechanics/controller actions have consistently mapped and learnable responses (Desurvire 2004)   
    
 

Shorten the learning curve by following the trends set by the gaming industry to meet users' expectations (Desurvire 2004)         
     Controls should be intuitive and mapped in a natural way. They should
be customizable and default to industry standard settings. They should
be basic enough to learn quickly yet expandable for advanced options
(Desurvire 2004)
