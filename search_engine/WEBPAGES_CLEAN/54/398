 Abstract  
The paper addresses the problem of computing
lower bounds on the optimal costs associated with
each unary assignment of a value to a variable in
combinatorial optimization problems. This task
is instrumental in probabilistic reasoning and is
also important for the development of admissible
heuristic functions that can guide search algorithms
for optimal solutions. The paper presents UD-MB,
a new algorithm that applies the mini-bucket elimination
idea [Dechter and Rish, 1997] to accomplish
this task. We show empirically that UD-MB
may achieve a substantial speed up over a brute-force
approximation method via mini-buckets.
