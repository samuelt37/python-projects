 Abstract  
   
Response time is a key differentiation among 
electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications. For many e-commerce applications, 
Web pages are created dynamically based 
on the current state of a business stored in 
database systems. Recently, the topic of Web 
acceleration for database-driven Web applications has drawn a lot of attention in both the 
research community and commercial arena. 
In this paper, we analyze the factors that have 
impacts on the performance and scalability of 
Web applications. We discuss system architecture issues and describe approaches to deploying caching solutions for accelerating Web 
applications. We give the performance matrix 
measurement for network latency and various 
system architectures. The paper is summarized with a road map for creating high  
performance Web applications.
