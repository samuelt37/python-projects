This script will automatically sync your publications with your web site. 
Publications are matched according to Title, Year and Publication-Type. 
If the title, year and pub-type are all identical, then the publication will be updated, instead of inserting a new publication.  
Please make sure of the following:
	   The file being uploaded is a valid EndNote XML export, saved with the UTF-8 character set. 
		 Characters are web freindly characters, for example DO NOT USE the Greek letter β (Beta).
