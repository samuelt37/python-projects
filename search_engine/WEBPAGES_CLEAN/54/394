&gt; 1. What about Content-Version and Derived-From? (Dan Connolly)  
&gt; 
&gt; 	If I read the spec right, Content-Version reflects the contents
&gt; 	of the document.  That is, if the same document is dished up
&gt; 	twice it is supposed to have the same Content-Version value.

It reflects the contents of the Entity, which includes both the body
document and the entity-header fields (metainformation about the document).
If the server is providing different information per checkout, then it
is in fact changing the entity.

&gt; 	As I argued before (and will continue arguing until I wear people
&gt; 	down :-) the identity of the source is not sufficient information
&gt; 	for a "checkin", because the VC system underneath the version-aware
&gt; 	web server may wish to find any context associated with a prior
&gt; 	"checkout".  
&gt; 
&gt; 	Now Roy Fielding says that Content-Version is opaque and could
&gt; 	be used exactly for this purpose, 'cause no one would be the wiser
&gt; 	if the Content-Version were different for each checkout of the
&gt; 	same document.  This is true, but now the names of these fields
&gt; 	are losing their meaning, no?  If it's checkout context, call it
&gt; 	"Checkout-Context" (or "Checkout-Cookie").

Checkout does not have meaning on all systems, whereas version has a generic
meaning (at times, too generic). It is intended to be as flexible as possible.
The "Content-" prefix is a requirement of MIME for what HTTP calls
entity-header field names.

BTW, I can set the  www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu  list Reply-To at any time --
the reason it is not on by default is that many people find it annoying,
particularly when you have cross-list discussions (like this one).
