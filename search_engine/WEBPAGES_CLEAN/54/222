  Hyperwebs  

 A Chimera hyperweb is a database consisting of instances of the Chimera
hypermedia concepts and their associated attributes. Hyperwebs are stored
under a WWW server's namespace and thus have an associated URL. All hyperwebs
on a particular website share the same set of viewers, objects, and views.
What varies between hyperwebs is the set of view-specific anchors and links.
Hyperwebs can be composed into hierarchies. This allows hyperwebs lower
in the hierarchy to inherit the anchors and links found in its parents.
Note, Chimera does not implement true inheritance however, since there is
no notion of an anchor or link in a subweb overriding the definition of
an anchor or link found in one of its ancestors. Only single inheritance
is allowed. Thus, a Chimera 2.0 website consists of a forest of hyperweb
trees providing clients with a flexible mechanism for organizing hypermedia
information.
