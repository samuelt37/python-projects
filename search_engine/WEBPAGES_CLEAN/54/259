bool open(const char        *name)
bool open(const std::string &amp;name)
bool open(unsigned char     *buffer, oefpos_t len)
    
Opens the output stream to the specified sources. Passing a  name 
parameter will result in invocation of a protected virtual method
to appropriate handle the specified output source. Passing a pointer to a
character buffer along with the buffer's size will result in the stream
wrapping the  buffer  and using that as the stream data destination.
Returns whether or not data can now be written to the stream.
