     Class BaseScreen    Abstract base class for all screen classes.  Screen classes are those 
  that take an oemolistream (list of molecules) as input and outputs a 
  subset of them, as an oemolostream, that passes some screening criteria, 
  determined by the instantiating class. 
   Subclasses should primarily just define their own constructor that 
  accepts as parameters anything necessary to define the screening 
  function, and override the screenMolecule(...) method. 
  Once done, then client code just needs to create an instance, set the 
  input and output sources and any screening parameters and call 
  runScreen(...) to fill in the output stream.

      Primary execution method to be called by client code. 
           
            
            
           
           
     
         
      
             runScreenByFilename ( self ,
         sourceFilename ,
         screenFilename )  
      Alternative to runScreen(...) where filenames are specified to 
      read / write instead of assuming the mOEIS and mOEOS attributes are 
      set.

     screenMolecule ( self ,
         mol ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Primary method for subclass to override.  Given a molecule 
  (OEMolBase), the method should just return True or False as to whether 
  the molecule passes the screening criteria.
        
  
 
   
     
     screenSmiles ( self ,
         smiles ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Wrapper for primary screenMolecule method.  Creates a molecule object 
  by parsing the SMILES string first.
        
  
 
   
     
     prepareParameters ( self ) 
   
     
     
     Another method for subclass to override.  Called before any 
  screenMolecule(...) is done by the runScreen(...) method. This is 
  important if say, the caller uses the setParameter(...) method after 
  instantiation, then need to have a chance to prepare the parameters for 
  usage, since can't count on it being done at construction time and don't 
  want to have to do it each time screenMolecule(...) is called. 
   However, this also means, if the screenMolecule(...) method is called 
  directly instead of runScreen(...), the caller must be responsible to 
  call prepareParameters(...) first. 
  The again, if no extra parameter preparation is necessary, as in if 
  simple calls to getParameter(...) can be used by the screenMolecule(...) 
  method, then not much to do here.
        
  
 
   
     
     runScreen ( self ) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Primary execution method to be called by client code. After setting 
  the input and output streams and any screening parameters, just iterate 
  through the input stream and pass all molecules that pass the 
  screenMolecule(...) method to the output stream.

   mOEIS 
  Output oemolostream to send screened results to
      Value: 
           
None
     
       
  
 
   
   mOEOS 
  Screening parameters as a dictionary. Better to have these all set by 
  the instantiating subclass's constructor, but have it here to provide 
  option to specify or change after instantiation, while still only using 
  base class methods.
      Value: 
           
None
