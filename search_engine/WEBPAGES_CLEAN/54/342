           About this website 
          
         Release date : April 20, 2013, Irvine, CA, Â© Ro Cammarota, 2013   Last update : October 26, 2016, Naples, Italy
        
       
  
        
        This website is developed using open source technologies (for example, I used the 
         bluefish  editor to develop and test pages and styles), 
        and open recommendations/standards (that is, recommendations from  W3C ). 
        All web pages and styles are verified to be valid HTML5 and CSS3 pieces of the web. 
        Below there is a short list of references that I used for technical details about HTML5, 
        CSS3 and Javascript. In spite of everything, the current version of this website does not layout well on all 
        browsers.
