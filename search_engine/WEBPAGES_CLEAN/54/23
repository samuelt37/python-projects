Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing
a hidden graph with m edges using additive queries.
Given a graph G = (V,E) and a set of vertices S subset V,
an additive query, Q(S), asks for the number of edges in
the subgraph induced by S. In this paper we give the first polynomial
time algorithm
with query complexity that matches the information theoretic lower
bound.
