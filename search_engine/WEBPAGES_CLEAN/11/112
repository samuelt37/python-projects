15.5.6 set 
 
   
bool set(char              *buffer, unsigned int len, bool copy)
bool set(const char        *buffer, unsigned int len, bool copy)
bool set(const std::string &amp;buffer)
    
Sets the input source of this stream based on the specified parameters. The
 buffer  parameter specifies the data string to be used as the input
source. If the  char *  constructors are used, the length of the input
buffer must be specified as well as whether or not a local copy of the buffer
should be made and used as the input source. If the  std::string  method
is used, a local copy of the input string will be made and used as the input
source.

  
Regardless of whether or not a local copy is made, the stream takes no
responsibility for the management of the original input source's memory.
