			 The Glider (glider 115) 

			 
				 
					  

				 
					  This pattern 
					was discovered by John Conway, 1970. 

					 It repeats every 4 generations,
					translated diagonally one cell,
					for a total speed of c/4.
					Every 2 generations, the same pattern appears,
					flipped diagonally. 

					 The same evolutionary sequence works in 256 rules ranging from
					 B3/S23 
					to  B3678/S0235678 .
