By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O( k )
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving  m  or  n 
to one involving min( m,   k ) or min( n,   k )
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the  k  smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order ( k +1) Voronoi diagrams.
