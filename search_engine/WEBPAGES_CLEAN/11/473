                The Bren School has articulation agreements with California community colleges that allow you to take courses that not only meet our admissions criteria, but can also be applied to our degree requirements.  If you have not done so already, check out  www.assist.org  for the latest articulation agreement specifically between your community college and UC Irvine.  If you plan it right, most of our majors support you in starting with your upper-division major requirements in your first quarter as a Bren School and UCI student.
