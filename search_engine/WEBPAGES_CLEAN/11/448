  CGAL::Memory_sizer  
 

  Definition 
 

The class   Memory_sizer   allows to measure the memory size used by the process.
Both the virtual memory size and the resident size are available (the resident
size does not account for swapped out memory nor for the memory which is not
yet paged-in).
  

 #include &lt; CGAL/Memory_sizer.h &gt; 
  

  Types 
 

The memory sizes are given in bytes.
  

    
           
  
typedef std::size_t
         
              
         
    size_type;
         
         
    
           

  Creation 
 

    
          Memory_sizer  m;
         
              
    Default constructor.
 

     

  Operations 
 

    
           
size_type
         
          
         
    m.virtual_size ()
         
          
    Returns the virtual memory size.
            
           
size_type
         
          
         
    m.resident_size ()
         
          
    Returns the resident memory size.
            

  Implementation 
 

Accessing this information requires the use of non-portable code.
Currently, there is support for Linux platforms and the Microsoft and Intel
compiler on Windows.  If a platform is not supported, then the macro
 CGAL_DONT_HAVE_MEMORY_SIZER  is defined by this file.
