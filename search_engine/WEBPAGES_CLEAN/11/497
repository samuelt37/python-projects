The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a family of design notations that
is rapidly gaining widespread acceptance as a de facto standard design
language. UML provides a variety of useful capabilities to the software
designer, including multiple, interrelated design views, a semi-formal
semantics expressed as a UML meta model, and an associated language for
expressing formal logic constraints on design elements. However, UML 
currently lacks support for capturing, representing, expressing, and
exploiting certain architectural concerns whose importance has been
demonstrated through research on software architectures. In particular,
UML lacks direct support for modeling and exploiting architectural 
styles, explicit software connectors, and global architectural 
constraints. This talk will discuss three possible strategies to support
such architectural concerns within UML: the first strategy involves 
using UML as is; the second strategy constrains the semantics of certain
UML constructs to model architectural concerns; finally, the third 
strategy augments UML to provide "native" support for architectures in 
UML. I will discuss the applicability, strengths, and weaknesses of the
three strategies and lessons learned in applying them to several 
existing architectural approaches.

  
 Biography:</strong>
Nenad Medvidovic is an Assistant Professor in the Computer
Science Department at the University of Southern California and 
is a faculty member of the USC Center for Software Engineering (CSE). 
He received his Ph.D. in 1998 from the Department of Information and 
Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. He also 
received an M.S. in Information and Computer Science in 1995 from the 
University of California, Irvine, and a B.S. in Computer Science summa 
cum laude in 1992 from Arizona State University. Medvidovic's research 
interests include software engineering, architectures, evolution, and 
reuse. He has published a number of papers on various topics pertaining
to architecture-based software development.

There is wide-spread industrial interest in using UML (the Unified 
Modeling Language) for object-oriented design. However, the poor 
usability of current UML tools presents a barrier to adoption. The first
half of this talk will assess the usability of two commercial UML tools
and one research prototype. The second half of this talk will assess how
well standard UML supports user interface design and it will summarize a
proposed UML extension for user interface modeling.
 
  
 Biography:</strong>
Jason E. Robbins is a Ph.D. student in Information and 
Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. He received 
his M.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine 
in 1995, and his B.S. in Computer Science from University of California,
Los Angeles in 1992. He has research interests in evolutionary software
development, design environments, and user interface design. He is the 
developer of ArgoUML, a pure-java UML CASE tool with special user 
interface features to support the cognitive needs of designers.
