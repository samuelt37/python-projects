Identifying Principals

  

       Digital Certificates alone arenï¿½t trustworthy
 

      [Kohnfelder78] introduced Certification Authorities
         CA Utility is proportional to its reach
 

      Clearinghouse simplifies group-membership
         ... But its power is inversely related
 

      The further up the pyramid, the greater the liability 
         Unprincipled compared to PGP/SPKI/SDSI:
 

      Identity certificates are not specific about authorization
  Hierarchy ends in God, not self
  Logistical difficulties of updating global revocation lists
       --&gt;
