 Tech Talks 

 
 

 
On a quarterly basis, the Bren School invites members of the corporate community to Bren Hall to make a technical presentation to computing and engineering faculty and graduate students.  Each talk  spotlights one company</strong>.
 
 
Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:
 
  Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School faculty and graduate students.
    
 Your company representatives have the opportunity to meet faculty and graduate students in a relaxed and informal setting based upon interests in certain research areas.
 
  
Tech Talks are usually scheduled from 12:00 – 1:30 p.m. throughout each quarter.  During this time, a senior technical representative or technology VP from your company presents on research topics and items of interests, such as software engineering, user interfaces, security and privacy to name a few.
