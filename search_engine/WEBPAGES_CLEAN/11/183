         Ombao, UCI Space-Time Modeling Group contribute to new  Handbook of Neuroimaging Data Analysis 

</strong>
          
                    
Several members of the UC Irvine  Space-Time Modeling Group  contributed to the recent release of the   Handbook of Neuroimaging Data Analysis  , which was published in November 2016 by Chapman and Hall/CRC. Statistics Professor and American Statistical Association Fellow   Hernando Ombao   served as one of the book’s editors, while Chee-Ming Ting, Carolina Euan, Lechuan Hu, Yuxiao Wang and Anna Schroeder were contributing co-authors for the 662-page handbook. In addition to Ombao, the handbook’s other editors were Martin Lindquist form Johns Hopkins University, Wesley Thompson from UC San Diego, and John Aston from the University of Cambridge.

  
 According to the publisher, the handbook explores various state-of-the-art aspects behind the statistical analysis of neuroimaging data, examines the development of novel statistical approaches to model brain data, and offers a path for statisticians to contribute to this rapidly emerging research area in theoretical and applied statistics. The book was designed for researchers in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, cognitive science, computer engineering, biomedical engineering, applied mathematics, physics and radiology; however, it can also be used as a textbook for graduate-level courses in statistics and biostatistics or as a self-study reference for Ph.D. students in statistics, biostatistics, psychology, neuroscience and computer science.
