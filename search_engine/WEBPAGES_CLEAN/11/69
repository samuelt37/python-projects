 Abstract 
  
In moving object environments it is infeasible for the database tracking the movement of
objects to store the exact locations of objects at all times. Typically the location of an object is
known with certainty only at the time of the update. The uncertainty in its location increases
until the next update. In this environment, it is possible for queries to produce incorrect results
based upon old data. However, if the degree of uncertainty is controlled, then the error of the
answers to queries can be reduced. More generally, query answers can be augmented with
probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answer. In this paper we study the execution of
probabilistic range and nearest-neighbor queries. The imprecision in answers to queries is
an inherent property of these applications due to uncertainty in data, unlike the techniques
for approximate nearest-neighbor processing that trade accuracy for performance. Algorithms
for computing these queries are presented for a generic object movement model, and detailed
solutions are discussed for two common models of uncertainty in moving object databases. We
also study approximate evaluation of these queries to reduce their computation time.
