  Interpolation and Extrapolation 

In many areas ranging from  cartography  to  molecular imaging and modeling , one finds the need to
fit a function or surface to a collection of scattered data points.
Interpolation refers to finding values for points between the given
points (i.e. inside their convex hull); if the function should extend
over a wider region of the input domain the problem is instead referred
to as extrapolation.  The method chosen should depend on the properties
one desires the resulting surface to have; many interpolation methods
are based on  Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay
triangulations .  A piecewise constant approximation, used in
rainfall estimation, can be found by simply choosing the function value
in each Voronoi cell to be that of the cell's generating site.  This is
a analog for continuous domains of the nearest neighbor rule from
machine learning theory, which has been generalized e.g. to voting among
three nearest neighbors; one could similarly define median-of-three
interpolation schemes (still piecewise constant, but less susceptable to
erroneous data), however I know of no application in which such schemes
have been tried.  The Delaunay triangulation itself provides a piecewise
linear continuous function, defined within the convex hull of the input,
that minimizes a certain energy functional.  "Natural neighbor
interpolation" is defined for each point x by adding x as a site to the
Voronoi diagram of the original sites, and averaging the sites' values
weighted by the fraction of the cell for x previously covered by each
other cell.  This somewhat complicated procedure results in a continuous
function smooth everywhere except at the original sites.
At the 1995 ARO-MSI Worksh. on Comp. Geom.,
 Ken
Clarkson 
described a similar technique that results in a function
smooth everywhere.

    Mosaic / stained glass graphic effect .  One gets interesting
visual effects by taking a random sample of pixels from a bitmap image,
computing the Voronoi diagram of the sample, and filling each cell
with the corresponding sample's color.  This appears to be what
Photoshop does in its "Pixelate-&gt;Crystalize" filter;
it can be thought of as a form of piecewise constant function interpolation.
