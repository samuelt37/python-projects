"Approximating Maximum Leaf Spanning Trees in Almost Linear Time"
Journal of Algorithms, Oct. '98 by Hsueh-I Lu &amp; R. Ravi 
Speaker:  Dave Goggin , ICS, UC Irvine 

Abstract: Given an undirected graph, finding a spanning tree of the
graph with the maximum number of leaves in MAX SNP-complete. In
this paper we give a new greedy 3-approximation algorithm for
maximum leaf spanning trees. The running time O((m+n)alpha(m,n))
required by our algorithm, where m is the number of edges and n is
the number of nodes, is almost linear in the size of the graph. We
also demonstrate thatour analysis of the performance of the greedy
algorithm is tight via an example.
