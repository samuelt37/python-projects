   3.5.1 ICMP Redirects 
     n    When a source sends a packet to a gateway for       forwarding, and that gateway is not the default       next hop, then the gateway will forward the       packet to the appropriate gateway. It then uses       ICMP to send a message to the source giving it       the gateway IP address that should be used next       time in conjunction with that destination.      n    If one examines
 the routing table after an ICMP       redirect, we
 see that a new entry has been added       and
 the flag �D� inserted to indicate its source.
