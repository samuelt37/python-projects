 Abstract  
This paper describes a diagnosis algorithm called structure-based abduction (SAB) 
which was developed in the framework of costraint networks [12]. The algorithm exploits 
the structure of the constraint network and is most efficient for near-tree problem domains. 
By analyzing the structure of the problem domain, the performance of such algorithms can be 
bounded in advance. We present empirical results comparing SAB with two model-based algorithms, 
MBD1 and MBD2, for the task of finding one or all minimal-cardinality diagnosis. MBD1 uses the 
same computing strategy as algorithm GDE [9]. MBD2 adopts a breadth-first search strategy 
similar to the algorithm DIAGNOSE [24]. The main conclusion is that for nearly acyclic circuits, 
such as the N-bit adder, the performance of SAB being linear provides definite advantages as the 
size of the circuit increases.
