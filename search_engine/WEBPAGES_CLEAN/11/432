3.24.6 DeleteAtom 
 

 
    
virtual bool DeleteAtom(OEAtomBase *atm)
    
Delete an atom from a molecule.  All bonds connected to the specified
atom are also automatically deleted.  Following an atom deletion, the
specified OEAtomBase pointer, and the OEBondBase pointers of any
incident bonds, are no longer valid and should not be used.  The atom
index associated with the atom, and the bond indices of any incident
bonds, are no longer recognized by the OEMolBase, but the indices of
all other atoms and bonds remain stable, and are unaffected by this
call.

  
After deleting atoms or bonds, it may be necessary to call the
 OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds  and  OEAssignAromaticFlags  functions
to update the ``in ring'' and ``aromatic'' properties of the atoms and
bonds in the modified molecule.
