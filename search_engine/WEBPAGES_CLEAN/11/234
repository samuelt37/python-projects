2. C++ Compilers and Platforms 
 
The OEChem Libraries are currently supported on the following platforms:

 

   x86 Linux on Intel Pentium series and AMD Athlon processors.
 
 IBM AIX 5.2 on PowerPC processors.
 
 Linux on Itanium2 processors (HP, SGI Altix and Intel).
 
 Linux on IBM pSeries PowerPC processors (RedHat 3.2AS and SuSE SLES 8).
 
 Compaq Tru64 5.1 on Alpha processors.
 
 HP-UX 11.00 on HP PA-RISC processors.
 
 HP-UX 11.22 on Itanium2 processors.
 
 Apple Mac OSX 10.3 (Darwin 7.2) on PowerPC processors.
 
 Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP on x86.
 
 RedHat Cygwin (on Microsoft Windows) on x86.
 
 SUN Solaris 2.8 on SPARC processors.
 
 Legacy SGI IRIX 6.5 on MIPS processors.
 
  
Due to the use of C++, and the lack or instability of a standardized
C++ ABIs on many operating systems, versions of the OEChem libraries
are provided for different compilers, and even different compiler
versions.  Typically, OEChem is available for the system's native C++
compiler (including g++ 2.96 on RedHat 7.x), and also for GNU g++
version 3.3.3.
