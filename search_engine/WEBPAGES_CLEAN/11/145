Speeds up 3-coloring by solving a harder problem:
constraint satisfaction in which each variable can take on
one of three values and each constraint forbids a pair of
variable assignments.  The detailed solution involves
several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,
3-edge-coloring, and 3-SAT.  The 3-SAT algorithm is fixed-parameter tractible in that it is polynomial time when the number of 3-variable clauses is O(log n).
Merged into
 3-coloring in time O(1.3289^n) 
for the journal version.
