void OEAssignAromaticFlags(OEMolBase &amp;mol,
                           const OEAroModel model = OEAroModelOpenEye,
                           bool clearflags = true,
                           unsigned int maxpath = 0,
                           bool prune = false)
    
Determine the aromatic atoms and bonds of a molecule.  The aromaticity
model to be used is specified by the ``model'' parameter, which defaults
to the OpenEye model of aromaticity.  Other predefined aromaticity models
provided by OEChem include OEAroModelDaylight, OEAroModelTripos,
OEAroModelMMFF and OEAroModelMDL that represent the Daylight, Tripos,
MMFF and MDL definitions respectively.  The ``clearflags'' parameter
is used to specify whether this call needs to clear the aromaticity
flags first, using OEClearAromaticFlags.  Newly created molecules that
have not had their aromaticity assigned yet can specify false, for a
very small performance advantage.

  
The ``maxpath'' parameter allows the user to specify the maximum path
length to consider an aromatic cycle, or zero (the default) to specify
no upper bound on aromatic cycle length.  Some formal models of aromaticity
use the value six, limiting aromaticity to six membered rings like benzene
or pyridine.

  
The ``prune'' parameter is used to specify whether or not to run a
post-processing step to consider rings with exo-double bonds as not
aromatic.  This is also required by some formal models of aromaticity.
