  Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).

     News Item 
     F 6/8 
     I've postponed the due date of  Assignment #5  to Sunday at 11:59pm, since it looked like a fair number of you wouldn't be able to finish it. 
     Sa 6/2 
     Last week's  code example  of designing and implementing a simple domain-specific language is now available. 
     Tu 5/30 
      Assignment #5  is now available. 
     Su 5/27 
     Last week's  code examples  are now available, along with a  Schedule  update. 
     Su 5/27 
     I added a clarification to Part 2 of  Assignment #4 .  You will not be permitted to write a single message containing a  repeated  field with all of the exercises; instead, I want you to confront the issue of writing a stream of multiple messages and figuring out, on your own, what the type of each message is.  The goal is to understand what Protocol Buffers does and does not do for you automatically. 
     M 5/21 
     Last Thursday's  code example  is now available. 
     F 5/18 
      Some new updates are available today: 
        This week's  code examples  are now available. 
          Assignment #4  is now available. 
         The  Schedule  has been updated. 
        
     W 5/9 
     Yesterday's  code example  of implementing the MapReduce algorithm in Erlang is now available.  Note, too, that Part 3 of  Assignment #3  has been updated to reflect the new version of that code example we wrote this quarter; fundamentally, the problem hasn't changed, but a few of the requirements have been changed to be more in line with the way we solved the problem in lecture this quarter. 
     Th 5/3 
     A few updates are available tonight:
        The  Schedule  has been updated.  Note that there are readings associated with some recent lectures. 
         Today's  code examples  are up. 
          Assignment #3  is available.  Note that Part 3 of the assignment makes reference to a code example that we've not yet covered and is not yet available on the web site, but we've certainly covered enough to allow you to work through the first two parts. 
        
     Th 5/3 
     An  Erlang tutorial  is now available; the Erlang-based third assignment will follow soon. 
     Th 4/19 
     The QuickUnit  code example  is now available. 
     Tu 4/17

       Welcome!  A few things: 
        The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, April 3.  For more information about meeting times and course policies, see the  Course Reference .  For information about lecture material and readings, see the  Schedule . 
         I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on this course web site.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the  Course Reference , the  Schedule , and the  Lab Manual , as well as a set of commented  Code Examples  that will be posted during the course of the quarter.
