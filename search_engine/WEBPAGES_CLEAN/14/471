        My latest passion is ballroom dancing and especially like tango, salsa, and swing.  I am associated with the tango club at UCI. We have a lot of fun learning dancing, attending workshops and practica, and going out to milongas.  
         I like outdoor adventures and enjoy a variety of activities such as hiking in hills and sailing in newport harbor.
