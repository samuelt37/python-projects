John and Ron Kohavi and Karl Pfleger.  Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem . ICML. 1994.    The C4.5 program is the program that comes with Quinlan's book (Quinlan 1992); the ID3 results were obtained by running C4.5 and using the unpruned trees. On the artificial datasets, we used the ``-s -m1'' C4.5  flags   which indicate that subset splits may be used and that splitting should continue until purity. To estimate the accuracy for feature subsets, we used 25-fold       Wl/odzisl/aw Duch and Karol Grudzi nski and Grzegorz Stawski.  SYMBOLIC FEATURES IN NEURAL NETWORKS . Department of Computer Methods, Nicolaus Copernicus University.    Both FSM network and k-NN algorithm achieved similar results (within statistical accuracy) on the raw data as on the converted data (the number of attributes did not change here). On the  Flags  dataset, containing 194 samples, 3 continuous and 25 symbolic attributes, 8 classes (majority rate 30.8%) and no missing values, 10-fold cross-validation tests were performed. Large improvement is observed
