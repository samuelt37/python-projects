  Replicators : B37/S345 

I found this replicator on Oct. 20, 2001. It repeats every 35
generations, on a one-dimensional 6-unit grid. 

     

 Along with several less-interesting oscillators, this rule has a
period-29 oscillator, which somehow resembles a thwarted pair of
replicators: 

     

 Jason Summers quickly found a way to confine a set of
replicators behind a pair of period-5 oscillators: 

     

 B37/S345 also has  a few interesting
spaceships  including a very small c/2 spaceship. 

 It is unknown whether the replicator can lead to high-period
spaceships, guns, or other interesting technology.
