  What is it? 
  The Curve Clustering Toolbox is a Matlab toolbox that implements a family
 of probabilistic model-based curve-aligned clustering algorithms. The 
 cluster models themselves are based on polynomial and spline regression 
 mixture models that allow for continuous curve alignment in both
 measurement space and in time. Learning is carried out using an
 EM (Expectation-Maximization) framework. The model specification and
 learning framework are detailed in 
 (Gaffney, 04) .
 
  The toolbox takes a set of curves such as this set of cyclones

     and finds a set of clusters in an unsupervised manner such as these

         The toolbox currently contains over 15 different clustering methods
from K-means; to Gaussian mixtures; polynomial regression
mixtures; spline regression mixtures; and various time-aligned, space-aligned,
and time- and space-aligned regression mixtures.

  The toolbox also contains many different types of functions for 
visualization, model selection, and data simulation. It is self-contained
and does not require any special matlab toolboxes to function. Of course,
it is also free!


   Documentation 
  There is both  online documentation  and matlab-based 
 documentation. To access the matlab-based documentation, download and
 unzip the toolbox in an appropriate directory. Then, run matlab, change
 to the install directory, and type  setcctpath . Now you can access
 the main help screen by typing  help_cct .

   Download 
  The current version of the CCToolbox is 0.98 (July 7th, 2005)
