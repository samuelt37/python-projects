 Abstract 
 

 
Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types to the web search engines today. However,
when a person name is queried, the returned webpages often contain documents related to several distinct namesakes
who have the queried name. The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person of inter 
est is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have been developed recently that attempt to
automate this disambiguation process. Nevertheless, the disambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major
room for improvement. This paper presents a new server-side WePS approach. It is based on collecting co-occurrence
information from the Web and thus it uses the Web as an external data source. A skyline-based classification technique
is developed for classifying the collected co-occurrence information in order to make clustering decisions. 
The clustering technique is specifically designed to (a) handle the dominance that exists in data and 
(b) to adapt to a given clustering quality measure. These properties allow the framework
to get a major advantage in terms of result quality over all the latest WePS techniques we are aware of, including all
the 18 methods covered in the recent WePS competition [2].
