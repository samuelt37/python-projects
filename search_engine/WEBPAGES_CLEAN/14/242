 The Impact of AND/OR Search Spaces on Constraint
Satisfaction and Counting 

 Rina Dechter and Robert Mateescu 

 
 Abstract  
The contribution of this paper is in vieweing search for constraint
processing in the context of AND/OR search spaces and in demonstrating the
impact of this view on solutions counting. In a companion paper we introduce
the AND/OR search space idea for probabilistic reasoning. In contrast to the traditional
(OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree displays some of the
independencies present in the graphical model explicitly and may sometimes reduce
the search space exponentially. Familiar parameters such as the depth of a
spanning tree, tree-width and path-width are shown to play a key role in characterizing
the effect of AND/OR search graphs vs the traditional OR search graphs.
Empirical evaluation focusing on counting demonstrates the spectrum of search
and inference within the AND/OR search spaces.
