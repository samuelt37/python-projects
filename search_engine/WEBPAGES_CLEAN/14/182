          Research 
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms, in particular, for multi-core architectures, external memory model, cache-oblivious model, and their parallel extensions, theoretical aspects of GPGPU computing and MapReduce framework. I am also interested in computational geometry and graph algorithms.
    Prospective students:</strong> I am looking for bright and self-motivated students to work with on the topics in parallel, sequential, I/O-efficient and cache-oblivious algorithms and data structures with applications to high-performance computing. If you have strong theoretical or programming background and would like to work on algorithms and/or applications for multicores, GPUs and clusters of processors, take a look at my papers and apply to the graduate program at the University of Hawaii (information can be found  here ).  Once you are admitted, drop me a line to discuss projects which might be of mutual interest.
