  C OURSE  S CHEDULE
AND  I NFORMATION    
 
  Instructor:    David G. Kay ,
406B Computer Science.  Stop by any time, or send electronic mail to "   kay   ".  
 
  Meeting time and place:   Tuesdays and
Thursdays, 12:30 to 1:50 p.m., in room 180 Computer Science.  Since this
is a two-unit course, we may skip the occasional class meeting.  
 
  Course goals:   In this course we will
cover teaching computer science at the college level, from the instructor's
perspective.  This perspective is useful even for students, as consumers
of instruction, but we presume that participants in this course have some
(perhaps tentative) plans to teach computer science, whether through University
Extension, Summer Sessions, or their own academic job.  We will look at
(and in most cases practice) designing and running one's own course,
designing assignments and exams, setting grades, preparing teaching portfolios
(records of your teaching for use in job applications and promotion cases),
making curricular decisions, and other related issues.  
 
  Course requirements:   This seminar
is not designed to impose a large time burden on the participants beyond
the class meetings themselves.  Grading is satisfactory/unsatisfactory or
pass/not-pass.  We ask that you attend the class meetings, participate in
the discussions, and prepare for the various activities, which will include
a variety of informal presentations leading towards your own complete design
of a course.
