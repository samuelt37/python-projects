  DAV Properties and HTTP/1.1 Methods (Cont�d)  
      PUT
 
  PUT records an arbitrary stream of bytes which are to be returned verbatim in a GET.
  DAV Properties MUST be in a specific format and as servers may record the properties using a specialized property store there is no reasonable expectation that the PUT body would be returned in the same form it was PUT.
  There is also the issue of non-DAV clients doing PUTs to property URIs.
