12.4 Determining Smallest Ring Membership 
 

 
In addition to determining whether an atom or a bond is in a ring or
cycle of a given size, its often useful to know the size of the smallest
ring or cycle that an atom or bond is in.  To do this OEChem provides
the functions OEAtomGetSmallestRingSize and OEBondGetSmallestRingSize.
For acyclic atoms and bonds, these functions return the value zero.  For
cyclic atoms and bonds, they return a value greater than or equal to
three.
