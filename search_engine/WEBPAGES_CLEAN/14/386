This namespace controls the processing performed when writing
 OEFormat::MF  format files using the  OEMolecularFormula 
function.

 
The  OEOFlavor::MF::Title  flag controls whether the molecule's

return by the  OEMolBase::GetTitle  functions appears, separated
by a single space character, on the same line as the molecular formula.
