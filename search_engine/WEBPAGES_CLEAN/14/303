 ICS 65 Fall 2012 
   Code Examples 

 

 

  Code examples, from lecture and otherwise 

 Over the course of the quarter, I'll be providing commented code examples for you.  You are not permitted to copy and paste any of this code into your own projects.  These examples are mostly to give you clean and well-documented examples of some of the things we cover in lecture (and possibly a few things that we don't, time permitting), so that you can be free in lecture to avoid trying to take detailed notes when we're writing code together, instead concentrating on understanding the process and the bigger-picture concepts at work.

  Old code examples 

 As this quarter's offering is a new incarnation of this course, I was asked by a couple of students to preserve the code examples from the previous version of this course.  Those examples, some of which you'll see again this quarter and others you won't, are available at the link below.
