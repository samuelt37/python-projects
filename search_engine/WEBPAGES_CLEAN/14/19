   ... count 29.1   
 The semantics of the ring count primitive,  R , differs
slightly between Daylight SMARTS and OpenEye SMARTS.  In Daylight semantics,
 R  n  means that an atom is in  n  rings of the chosen SSSR.
As the choice of SSSR is non-deterministic, this interpretation can cause an
arbitrary set of atoms to match depending upon input order.  For example, in
the symmetric molecule, cubane, four of the eight atoms will appear in two
SSSR rings, and half of the atoms appear in three, but the choice is
made almost randomly.  Rather than attempt to reproduce these weak
semantics, OpenEye strengthens the definition of  R  n  to mean the
number of ring bonds to an atom, which is graph invariant and therefore
independent of a molecule's input order.  Notice, that the interpretation
of  [R]  and  [R0] , i.e. ring membership, remains the same.
Similarly, Daylight  [R1]  is approximately equal to OpenEye  [R2] ,
and Daylight  [R2]  is approximately equivalent to OpenEye  [R3] .

 
  ... hybridization 29.2   
 The atomic hybridization primtive,  ^ , is an OpenEye
extension that is not available in Daylight SMARTS, but can be implemented using
recursive SMARTS.
