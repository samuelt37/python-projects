 Undirected ST-Connectivity in Log-Space 

 Nodari Sitchinava

 Abstract: 

 This talk will be a presentation of a paper
by Omer Reingold that won the Best Paper Award at STOC 2005. 

 The author of the paper presents a  deterministic  log-space algorithm
that solves st-connectivity in undirected graphs. As undirected
st-connectivity is complete for the class of problems solvable by
symmetric, non-deterministic, log-space computations (the class SL),
this algorithm implies that SL = L (where L is the class of problems
solvable by deterministic log-space computations).
