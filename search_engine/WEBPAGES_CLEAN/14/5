  PATCH (cont�d)  
      Server support for PATCH is optional
 
     If a server supports PATCH, it MUST support the application/xml diff format defined in the DAV specification
 
     application/xml diff format contains a list of octet-range changes to the resource.  Allowable operations: insert, delete, replace a range of octets.
