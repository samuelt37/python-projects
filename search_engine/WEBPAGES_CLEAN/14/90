      PUT for Collections
 
  In HTTP/1.1, PUT exactly stores the request entity under the Request-URI, hence its semantics are limited to non-collection resources
  If a PUT is invoked on a collection resource, it MUST fail
  When PUT creates a new non-collection resource, a server MAY add that new resource to one or more collections
