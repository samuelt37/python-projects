&gt;| At this point, let me introduce resource C.html, which, like A.html, has
&gt;| three versions, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1.  As you might imagine, C.html also
&gt;| includes logo.gif, but C.html is an older page which has not been updated
&gt;| recently, and hence includes logo.gif version 1.0. So the URL for C.html
&gt;| is:
&gt;|
&gt;|  http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html 
&gt;|
&gt;| Utilizing the solution of adding a symbolic link to logo.gif, version 1.0
&gt;| into collection "version=2.1", we suddenly realize that a symbolic link to
&gt;| logo.gif already exists (left over from adding the link to version 2.0 of
&gt;| logo.gif for A.html version 2.1).  This is a problem.
&gt;
&gt;Your examples are confusing versions (generically) and revision numbers.
&gt;Revisions are usually file-specific.  That is, each file has its own
&gt;independent revision space.  Versions are more generic, and include
&gt;symbolic labels (the example I used) which occupy a separate namespace
&gt;from revisions.
&gt;
&gt;Thus
&gt;
&gt;         http://foo.bar.com/version=best/A.html 
&gt;         http://foo.bar.com/version=best/B.html 
&gt;
&gt;May get revision 2.1 of A.html and 2.0 of B.html.  Surfing works.
&gt;

But how do you handle the C.html case?  C.html wants to grab logo.gif,
version 1.0, but A.html is already grabbing version 2.0 (and hence version
2.0 is presumably already mapped into "version=best", right?)
