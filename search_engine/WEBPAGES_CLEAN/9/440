   While and Infinite Loop  
        Sequential Statement

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The  while  loop repeats the enclosed sequence of statements if
the condition tested is true. The condition is tested before wach
iteration.
 process (A)
    variable I :
      integer range 0 to 4;
begin
    Z &lt;= "0000";
    I := 0;
    while (I &lt;= 3) loop
      if (A = I) then
        Z(I) &lt;= '1';
      end if;
      I := I + 1;
    end loop; 
end process;  
    
  

 
    While loops may be useful in test benches:
 process
begin
  while NOW &lt; MAX_SIM_TIME loop
    CLK &lt;= not CLK ;
    wait for PERIOD/2;
  end loop;
  wait;
end process;  
    
  

 
    To prevent simulation hang-up an infinite loop should usually
contain at least one  wait  or
 exit  statement:
 process (A)
  variable I :
    integer range 0 to 4;
begin
  Z &lt;= "0000";
  I := 0;    
  L1: loop
    exit L1 when I = 4;
    if (A = I) then
       Z(I) &lt;= '1';
    end if;
    I := I + 1;
  end loop;    
end process;  
    
  



 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    While and infinite loops are supported by some logic synthesis
tools, with certain restrictions.
 
    
  



 
         Whats New in '93        

The while and infinite loop statements have not changed in  VHDL -93.
