constant constant_name : type := value;
  
   



 
See LRM section 4.3.1.1

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
    
constant BUS_WIDTH : integer := 8;
constant FOUR_ONES :
       std_logic_vector(3 downto 0):= "1111";

constant PERIOD : time := 10 ns;
constant MAX_SIM_TIME : time:= 50 * PERIOD;
 
 
   

 
   The values of array constants of types other than stribg, bit_vector
and std_logic_vector, must be set using aggregates. 
type T_CLOCK_TIME is ARRAY(3 downto 0) of
    integer range 0 to 9;
constant TWELVE_O_CLOCK :
    T_CLOCK_TIME := (1,2,0,0);
  
   

 
   In a package, a constant may be  deferred . This means its
value is defined in the package body. the value may be changed by
re-analysing only the package body. 
package P is
  constant C : integer;
end P;

package body P is
  constant C : integer := 200;
end P;
  
   

 
   Provided they are of the correct type, constants may be used in any
expression. They may be associated with generics of component instances
and passed into procedures. 
process
  type T_DATA is array (0 to 3)
        of bit_vector(7 downto 0);
  constant DATA : T_DATA :=
            ("00001000",
             "00010001",
             "00100010",
             "01000011");
begin
  for I in DATA'range loop
    serialize_byte(DATA(I),DOUT);
  end loop;
end process;
  
   



 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

Constants are supported for synthesis, providing they are of a type
acceptable to the logic synthesis tool. They are either synthesised as
connections to logic '1' or '0', or are used to help minimise the number
of gatyes required. Deferred constants may not bwe supported.

 
        Whats New in '93       

Constants and constant expressions may also be associated with input
ports of component instances in  VHDL -93. In  VHDL -87 this was only
possible via an intermediate signal.
