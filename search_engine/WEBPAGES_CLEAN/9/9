 Deliverable 1: Prospectus<body>  ICS 125: Project in Software System Development     Fall Quarter 2003     DRAFT: Prospectus  As has been discussed in class, you have substantial flexibility in choosingthe specific form for the content of your deliverables. Below is a listof items that should be included in your first deliverable, a project prospectus. There is no need to select a manager and clerical support for this deliverablenor will you be doing performance appraisals at this point. Rather youshould use this opportunity to brainstorm and get to know each other.   Due Date As shown on the course web site.  Understanding One of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing anunderstanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with yourproject. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishingyour task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,or changing. In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understandingby writing an introduction to your project that highlights its variousimportant aspects. You should also include a description of activitiesdone in support of developing understanding - like interviews with thecustomer, for example. (One of the best ways, of course, to gain an understandingof a piece of software is to interview the original developer.)     Technical Marketing Sheet Include a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technicalthan a "sales brochure") suitable for describing your product to a technicallyliterate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflectingthat you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulatehow your product will add value.    Project Plan Use the outline below in presenting your project plan.  Introduction    Scope and Purpose of Document (overview)   Project Summary       Objectives      Major Activities      Management and Technical Constraints        Project Risks       Risk Analysis           Identification (what is the risk?)          Risk Estimation (how big a consequence would it have?)          Evaluation (how likely is it to occur?)           Risk Management          Risk Aversion Options (what can you do to avoid it?)         Risk Monitoring Procedures (how do you keep track of whether it is going      to occur?)           Schedule        Project Work Breakdown Structure       Task Network (include more detail than just your major deliverables)       Time-Line Chart (when are you going to finish your various work products?)       Resource Table (how is each team member going to be applied throughout    the weeks of the project?)       (You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with parts of    this task.)        Project Estimates       Historical Data used for the Estimates (personal data? team data? application-domain   data (from other projects?))      Estimation Techniques      Estimates (how long is each sub-task going to take?)       Project Resources       People (who is on the team?)      Hardware and Software      Special Resources       Staff Organization        Team Structure (What do you expect to be the team's organizational structure?    Who reports to whom?)          Member Responsibilities (How are management and clerical tasks carried    out ? e.g., who will manage which phases and who will provide clerical    support? Have team members been assigned specific technology-area responsibilities?)        Tracking and Control Mechanisms        (How are you going to keep track of where you are at? How are you going    to control your deliverables? (I.e. document management, version control,    configuration control)        Appendices (if needed)    Prospectus Presentations/Reviews.  Each team must prepare a 15 minute presentation, after which we willallow up to 5 minutes of questions. Prepare your presentation appropriately.Your presentation should describe both your technical marketing and yourproject plan.  Focus on the essential issues: the key technical goals,challenges, and risks.  Don't spend air time on the obvious.  Â   With respect to your technical marketing plan, you can present things suchas    the problem is being solve;   important functionality your system will provide;   why the system to be developed is important;   what process will the automated system replace;   what's the value added of your system;   what are the selling points of the particular system you will develop  (e.g., what's different about your approach and/or chosen emphasis).   With respect to your project plan, you might consider presenting:       how you will develop it (what's your development process);      what are the risks involved;      time estimates for each task;      critical resources.      </body>
