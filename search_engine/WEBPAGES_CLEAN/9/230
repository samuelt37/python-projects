8.22 OEResidueIndex 
 

 
The namespace is used to encode the return values from the
 OEGetResidueIndex  function(s).  If the biopolymer residue name
is not recognized, the  OEGetResidueIndex  function returns either
a zero or a unsigned integer value other than the values listed below.
As future releases of OEChem may add to this namespace, code should not
test for against zero, but instead check against the values that its
interested in and treat all other values as ``unrecognized''.

  
The table below lists the symbolic constant names that are assigned integer
values in OEChem's headers.  These actual constants are not listed here,
as they may change from release to release and therefore the symbolic names
should be used.  However, because these values really are unsigned integer
constants they may be used, for example, in the cases of a switch statement,
 i.e.  their values are known by the compiler at compile-time.
