         Bowker awarded two NSF grants for big data research
</strong>
          
                    
  Geoffrey Bowker </strong>, informatics professor and director of UC Irvine’s Values in Design Lab, was awarded two National Science Foundation (NSF) grants totaling more than $632,000 to support his project, “Collaborative Research: Institutionalizing the Data Sciences, a Sociotechnical Investigation of BDHubs.” 

  
Bowker’s work will focus on big data and the process of collecting and analyzing data in university curricula, state governance and industry strategy. “This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government,” wrote Bowker.
The grants are set to run between August 2016 and July 2019. Bowker will be working in collaboration with David M. Ribes of the University of Washington on the project.
