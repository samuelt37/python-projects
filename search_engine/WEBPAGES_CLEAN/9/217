			 Fano Experimental Web Server 

			 
				 This is Fano, an experimental object-oriented web server operated by
				 David Eppstein 
				at the  School of Information
				and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine .
				Fano is based on
				 Webster ,
				a free and very small Java web server.
				However, I have heavily modified this code to generate most pages
				synthetically rather than serving them from files. 

				 Available databases: 

				   Gliders in Life-like cellular automata
