  A (binary)  relation 
 R 
between sets  X  and  Y 
is a subset of  X × Y . 
( X × Y  is a
 Cartesian product .) 
 

  Thus, a relation is a set of pairs. 
 

  The interpretation of this subset
is that it contains all the pairs for which the relation is true. 
We write  xRy  if the relation is true for
 x  and
 y 
(equivalently, if
( x , y ) ∈  R ). 
 

   X  and  Y  can be the same set,
in which case the relation is
said to be "on" rather than "between":
 

  A (binary)  relation   R 
on set  E 
is a subset of  E × E . 
( E × E 
is a  Cartesian product .) 
 

  Examples using  E ={0,1,2,3}:
 
  {(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}.  This relation is =.
   
   {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}.  This relation is &lt;.
   
   {(0,0), (1,1), (1,0), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)}. 
    This relation is ≥.
   
  
Relations may also be of other  arities . 
An   n -ary relation 
 R  between sets
 X  1 , ... ,
and
 X  n 
is a subset of the
  n -ary product 
 X  1 ×...× X  n ,
in which case  R  is a set of
 n -tuples. 
 


 Some specific relations 

 
The  empty relation  between sets
 X  and  Y ,
or on  E ,
is the empty set  ∅ . 
 

  The empty relation is false for all pairs. 
 

 
The  full relation 
(or  universal relation )
between sets
 X  and  Y 
is the set  X × Y . 
 

 
The  full relation  on set  E 
is the set  E × E . 
 

  The full relation is true for all pairs. 
 

 
The  identity relation  on set
 E 
is the set
{( x , x ) |  x  ∈  E }. 
 

 
The identity relation is true for all pairs whose first and second element
are identical. 
 


 Examples 

 
All these relations are definitions of the relation "likes"
on the set {Ann, Bob, Chip}. 
 
  Happy world 
      In this world, "likes" is the full relation on the universe. 
      Because it is full,
      every person likes every other person,
      including him- or herself. 
      The extension of this "likes" relation is
      {(Ann,Ann),(Ann,Bob),(Ann,Chip),(Bob,Ann),(Bob,Bob),(Bob,Chip),      (Chip,Ann),(Chip,Bob),(Chip,Chip)}. 
     
   Narcissistic world 
      In this world, "likes" is the identity relation on the universe. 
      Because it is the identity relation,
      every person likes him- or herself, but no one else. 
      The extension of this "likes" relation is
      {(Ann,Ann),(Bob,Bob),(Chip,Chip)}. 
     
   Emptily unhappy world 
      In this world, "likes" is the empty relation. 
      Because it is empty,
      no person likes any other person,
      including him- or herself. 
      The extension of this "likes" relation is
      {}. 
     
  Properties of relations 

 
Let  R  be a relation on
 E , and let
 x , y , z  ∈  E . 
 

    A relation  R  is ...  if ... 
        
       A relation  R  is ...  if ... 
     reflexive 
        xRx    
        
       irreflexive 
        xRy  implies  x≠y  
     symmetric 
        xRy  implies
         yRx    
        
       antisymmetric 
        xRy  and  yRx  implies
       x=y  
     transitive 
        xRy  and  yRz  implies
       xRz    
        
        
       Examples using =, &lt;, and ≤ on integers:
 
  = is reflexive (2=2)
   
   = is symmetric ( x =2 implies 2= x )
   
   &lt; is transitive (2&lt;3 and 3&lt;5 implies 2&lt;5)
   
   &lt; is irreflexive (2&lt;3 implies 2≠3)
   
   ≤ is antisymmetric
    ( x ≤ y  and
     y ≤ x  implies
     x = y )
   
   Examples using Ann, Bob, and Chip:
 
   Happy world  
      "likes" is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 
      (It is an  equivalence  relation.) 
     
    Narcissistic world  
      "likes" is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and transitive. 
      (It is both an  equivalence  relation
      and a  non-strict order  relation,
      and on this world produces an
       antichain .) 
     
    Emptily unhappy world  
      "likes" is not reflexive, and is trivially irreflexive,
      symmetric, antisymmetric, and transitive. 
     
   Circularly
  unhappy world 
        This world's extension of "likes" is
      {(Ann,Bob),(Bob,Chip),(Chip,Ann)}. 
      "likes" is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and not transitive. 
     
   Somewhat-happy world with
  2-circuit 
      This world's extension of "likes" is {(Ann,Bob),(Bob,Ann),(Chip,Chip)}. 
      "likes" is neither reflexive nor irreflexive, but is both
      symmetric and transitive.. 
     
   Happy
  world with 2-circuit 
      This world's extension of "likes" is {(Ann,Ann),(Ann,Bob),(Bob,Ann),(Bob,Bob),(Chip,Chip)}. 
      "likes" is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.. 
      (It is an  equivalence  relation.) 
     
  Equivalence relations 

  An  equivalence relation 
is a relation that is
 reflexive ,
 symmetric , and
 transitive . 
 

 Example:  = is an equivalence relation,
because = is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 
 

  An equivalence relation  partitions 
its domain  E  into disjoint
 equivalence classes . 
 
  Each equivalence class contains a set of elements of  E 
    that are equivalent to each other,
    and all elements of  E  equivalent to
    any element of the equivalence class
    are members of the equivalence class. 
   
   The equivalence classes are
     disjoint : 
    there is no  x  ∈  E 
    such that  x  is in more than one equivalence class. 
   
   The equivalence classes  exhaust  E: 
    there is no  x  ∈  E 
    such that  x  is in no equivalence class. 
   
   Any element of an equivalence class may be its
     representative ;
    the representative stands for all the members of its equivalence class. 
   
  Examples:
 
  Smaller circle plus dot happy world 
      This world's "likes" is an equivalence relation,
      and so it induces a partition of {Ann,Bob,Chip}. 
      The partition consists of two equivalence classes,
      {Ann,Bob} and {Chip}. 
      These equivalence classes are  disjoint 
      (their intersection is empty)
      and  exhaustive 
      (every element is in an equivalence class). 
     
    Narcissistic world  
      This world's "likes" is also an equivalence relation,
      inducing a partition consisting of three singleton equivalence classes
      {Ann}, {Bob}, and {Chip}
      (clearly disjoint and exhaustive). 
     
    Happy world  
      This world's "likes" is also an equivalence relation. 
      The partition it induces consists of one equivalence class,
      {Ann,Bob,Chip} (exhaustive and trivially disjoint). 
     
  Order relations 

  An  order 
(or  partial order )
is a relation that is
 antisymmetric 
and
 transitive . 
 

 
Examples: 
 
  ≤ is an order relation on numbers. 
   
    ⊆  is an order relation on sets.
   
   The prefix relation on
     binary strings 
    is an order relation.
   
    The symbol
     ⊑ 
    is often used to represent an arbitrary partial order. 
   
  
In mathematics and formal reasoning,
order relations are commonly allowed to include equal elements
as well. 
However, for some authors and
in everyday usage,
orders are more commonly
 irreflexive ,
so that "John is taller than Thomas"
does not include the possibility that John and Thomas are the same height. 
 

 
A   strict order  is one that is
 irreflexive  and
 transitive ;
such an order is also trivially  antisymmetric 
because there is no  x  and  y 
such that  xRy  and  yRx . 
 

 
A   non-strict order 
is one that is
 reflexive ,
 antisymmetric ,
and
 transitive . 
Any order we discuss will be considered non-strict
unless specifically stated otherwise. 
 

 
Examples: 
 
   &lt; is strict, ≤ is non-strict. 
   
     ⊂  is strict,  ⊆  is non-strict. 
   
    "taller than" is strict (no one is taller than him- or herself). 
   
  
An order relation  R  on  E 
is a  total order 
if either  xRy  or  yRx 
for every pair of elements
 x , y  ∈  E . 
 

 
An order relation  R  on  E 
is a  partial order 
if there is a pair of elements
 x , y  ∈  E 
for which neither  xRy  nor  yRx . 
 

 
Let  R  be an order relation on  E 
and let
 x , y  ∈  E . 
 x  and  y  are
 incomparable  under R
if neither  xRy  nor  yRx . 
We write this as  x || y 
(or  x # y ). 
From the definitions,
we can see that a  total order 
is one for which no two elements are incomparable,
and a  partial order 
is one for which at least two elements are incomparable. 
 

  Examples: 
 
   &lt; on the integers is a total order. 
    For any two integers  x  and  y ,
    either
     x &lt; y 
    or
     y &lt; x . 
   
     ⊂  on the  powerset  of the integers
    is a partial order;
    it is not total. 
    There are many incomparable sets in this (and any other) powerset. 
    For example,
    {1,4,9}⊄{1,3,5} and
    {1,3,5}⊄{1,4,9}, so
    these two sets are incomparable and we write {1,4,9}||{1,3,5}
    or {1,4,9}#{1,3,5}. 
   
  Constructing a relation from other relations 

  Let  R  be a relation from  X 
to  Y  and
S be a relation from  Y  to  Z . 
 

 
The   composition 
(or  join )
of  R  and  S ,
written  R . S ,
is the relation
{( x , z ) ∈  X × Z  |  xRy  and ySz for some  y  ∈  Y }. 
 

 
A function-style notation
 S ○ R 
is also sometimes seen,
but is quite inconvenient for relations. 
The notation  R . S 
is easier to deal with
as the relations are named in the order that leaves them adjacent
to the elements that they apply to
(thus  x ( R .S) z 
because  xRy 
and  ySz   
for some  y ). 
 

 
The  product 
of two relations  R  and  S 
is the relation
{( w,x,y,z ) |  wRx ∧ yRz } }
 


 
The  converse 
(or  transpose )
of  R ,
written  R   −1  ,
is the relation
{( y , x ) |  xRy }.   
 

 
The  closure 
of a relation  R 
is the relation
{( x,z ) | ( x,y )  ∈   R ∧( y,z )  ∈   R }. 
 

 
The  transitive closure 
of  R 
is the smallest
 transitive  relation  S 
such that  R  ⊆  S . 
You can obtain the transitive closure of  R 
by  closing  it,
closing the result,
and continuing to close the result of the previous closure
until no further tuples are added. 
 

 
Because relations are sets (of pairs),
all the operations on sets
also apply to relations. 
 

 
The   intersection  of
 R  and
 S , written
 R      S ,
is the relation
{ x ( R      S )y |  xRy  and xSy}.  
 

 
The   union  of  R  and  S ,
written  R  ∪  S ,
is the relation
{ x ( R  ∪  S )y |  xRy  or  xSy }.
 

 
The   difference  of
 R  and  S ,
written  R − S  or
 R  \  S ,
is the relation { x ( R − S ) y  |  xRy  but not  xSy }.
 


 Examples 

 
Let
 
    X ={Airplane,Pool,Restaurant}
   
     Y ={Goggles,Heels,Seatbelt,Tuxedo}
   
     Z ={Buckle,Pocket,Strap}
   
     R  be the relation "is where one wears",
    with extension
    {(Airplane,Seatbelt),(Airplane,Tuxedo),(Pool,Goggles),(Restaurant,Heels),(Restaurant,Tuxedo)}
   
     S  the relation "can have a",
    with extension
    {(Goggles,Strap),(Heels,Buckle),(Heels,Strap),(Seatbelt,Buckle),(Seatbelt,Strap),(Tuxedo,Pocket)}
   
   Composition 
       R.S  is
      {(Airplane,Buckle), (Airplane,Pocket), (Airplane,Strap),
      (Pool,Buckle), (Pool,Strap),
      (Restaurant,Buckle), (Restaurant,Pocket), (Restaurant,Strap)}. 
     
   Converse 
       R  -1  is
      {(Goggles,Pool),(Heels,Restaurant),(Seatbelt,Airplane),(Tuxedo,Airplane),(Tuxedo,Restaurant)}.
     
  Concepts sometimes confused with each other 

 
 Transitivity 
and
 composition 
may seem similar: 
both are defined using  x ,  y , and
 z , for one thing. 
But they are unrelated: 
transitivity is a property of a single relation, while
composition is an operator on two relations that produces a third relation
(which may or may not be transitive). 
 

 
 Symmetric  and  converse 
may also seem similar;
both are described by swapping the order of pairs. 
But they are also unrelated: 
symmetry is a property of a single relation,
while
converse is an operator that takes a relation and produces
another relation
(which may or may not be symmetric). 
It is true, however,
that the union of a relation with its converse is a symmetric relation. 
 


 Relations on relations 

 
Because relations are sets (of pairs),
the relations on sets
also apply to relations. 
 

 
Let  E  be a set and  R  and
 S  be relations on  E . 
 

 
 R  and  S  are
 equal  if
for every
 x , y  ∈  E ,
 xRy  iff  xSy .
 

 
 R  is a   subset  of
 S  if
for every
 x , y  ∈  E ,
 xRy  implies  xSy .
 

 
Examples:
 
   " Happy world " is equal to the full relation. 
   
    " Smaller circle plus dot
    somewhat-happy world likes "
    is a subset of "Smaller circle plus dot happy world likes".
