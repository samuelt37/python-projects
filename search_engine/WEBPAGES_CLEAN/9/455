The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.
