    				Promoting Events: Promotro    			 
  			 
    			  Promotro.com  announced their beta.  Promotro is also in the events space.  According to their lead developer — Adam Wulf: 
  we’re doing something similar to upcoming.org , however we are after a more social feel, encouraging tags and comments to make it feel more like a community and less like a database.  
 I do find that their promote feature is a way to judge the popularity of an event.  They have plans to bring photos and other features to events.
