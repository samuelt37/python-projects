   Package  
        Primary Library Unit 
            Syntax        
  

 
      package  package_name is
	declarations
 end  package_name;  
    
  




 
See LRM section 2.5

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    Declarations may typically be any of the following:
 type ,  subtype ,
 constant ,  file ,
 alias ,  component ,
 attribute ,  function ,
 procedure 
 package DEMO_PACK is
  constant SOME_FLAG : bit_vector := "11111111";
  type STATE is (RESET,IDLE,ACKA);
  component HALFADD 
    port(A,B : in bit;
         SUM,CARRY : out bit);
  end component;
end DEMO_PACK;
  
    
  

 
    Items declared in a package are visible wherever selected via a
 use  clause. For instance, assume DEMO_PACK is
analysed into library work:
 use work.DEMO_PACK.all;
entity DEMO is
port
 (Z: out bit_vector(7 downto 0));
end DEMO;

architecture BEHAVE of DEMO is 
begin
  Z &lt;= SOME_FLAG; 
end BEHAVE;
  
    
  

 
    When a procedure or function is declared in a package, its body (the
algorithm part) must be placed in the
 package body . 
    
  

 
    A constant declared in a package may be  deferred . This means
that its value may be changed by re-analysing omly the
 package body :
 package P is
  constant C : integer;
end P;

package body P is
  constant C : integer := 200;
end P;
  
    
  



 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

Packages are usually supported by synthesis tools, provided all the
items they declare are compatible with synthesis
 
Synthesisable declarations and non-synthesisable declarations (e.g.for a
test bench) should therefore be placed in separated packages.
  
Design Libraries are often not supported, so design files containing
packages must either by analysed first for synthesis, or be present in
the local directory.
  
If a package has a body, it must usually be in the same design file as
the package itself.

  
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, the keyword  end  may be followed by the
keyword  package , for clarity and consistancy.
  
 Shared variables  and  groups  may
also be declared in a package.
