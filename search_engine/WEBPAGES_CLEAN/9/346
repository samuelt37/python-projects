This presentation describes the Practical Software Measurement (PSM) 
approach. PSM is sponsored by the Office of Undersecretary of Defense 
for Acquisition &amp; Technology (OUSD A&amp;T). The goal of the project is to 
provide program managers with the objective information needed to 
successfully meet cost, schedule, and technical objectives. 

  

The PSM process
   is based on actual software measurement experience on DoD, Government, 
and industry programs 

  treats measurement as a flexible process not a pre-defined list of 
graphs or reports 

  integrates the measurement requirements into the developers process 

  defines an issue-driven analysis approach which helps the program 
manager make informed decisions 

  supports the current software acquisition and measurement 
policy and provides a basis for enterprise level software measurement.
   

The PSM team produced and deployed a guidebook, training, tools, 
workshops, and a cooperative transition approach that is currently 
being used by DoD, Government and industry.
