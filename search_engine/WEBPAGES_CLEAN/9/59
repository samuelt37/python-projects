			   Abstract  
			   Chinese Pinyin input methods are very important for Chinese language
				 processing. In many cases, users may make typing errors. For example, a user wants to type
				 in "shenme" (ä»ä¹, meaning "what" in English) but may type in "shenem" instead.
				 Existing Pinyin input methods fail in converting such a Pinyin sequence with errors
				 to the right Chinese words. To solve this problem, we developed an efficient error-tolerant
				 Pinyin input method called "CHIME" that can handle typing errors. By incorporating state-of-the-art
				 techniques and language-specific features, the method achieves a better performance
				 than state-of-the-art input methods. It can efficiently find relevant words
				 in milliseconds for an input Pinyin sequence. 			  
			 
			 
			   Framework 
                           For an input Pinyin sequence with typing errrors, CHIME works in three steps: 
                            Detect mistyped Pinyins that are not included in the predefined Pinyin dictionary. 
			     For each mistyped Pinyin, CHIME find top-k similar candidate Pinyins. 
			     CHIME converts the corrected Pinyin sequence to the most likely sequence of Chinese words.

			   inputPinyin : contains the 2,000 input Pinyin sequences (679 sequences contain at least one typo). 
			    outputHanzi : contains the corresponding Chinese word sequences that users intend to type in. 
			    SogouResult : contains the conversion results from  Sogou  .  
			    CHIMEResult : contains the conversion results from CHIME.

 Type in Pinyins with errors, and we are trying to predict what you intend to type in. 
If you type in "shenem", we can find "ä»ä¹". If you type in "xiexe", we can find "è°¢è°¢".
