  Kernel::Side_of_oriented_sphere_d  


A model for this must provide:
 

    
         
    template &lt;class ForwardIterator&gt;
         
            
          Bounded_side 
         
          
         
     fo ( ForwardIterator first,  ForwardIterator last,   Kernel :: Point_d  p)  

         
                
    returns the relative position of point
   p  to the oriented sphere defined by the points in  A =     tuple [first,last)  The order of the points in  A  is important,
  since it determines the  orientation  of the implicitly constructed
  sphere.  If the points in  A  are positively oriented, the positive
  side is the bounded interior of the sphere.  Precondition:   A 
  contains  d+1  points in  d -space.  Requirement:  The value type of
   ForwardIterator  is   Kernel :: Point_d  .
