 Top- K  Color Queries for Document Retrieval 
 Saumi Bandyopadhyay, UC Irvine 

 In this paper we describe a new efficient (in fact optimal)data
structure for the top- K  color problem. Each element of an array
 A  is assigned a color  c  with priority
 p ( c ). For a query range [ a ,  b ] and a
value  K , we have to report  K  colors with the highest
priorities among all colors that occur in  A [ a .. b ],
sorted in reverse order by their priorities. We show that such queries
can be answered in  O ( K ) time using an
 O ( N  log σ) bits data structure, where
 N  is the number of elements in the array and σ is the
number of colors. Thus our data structure is asymptotically optimal with
respect to the worst-case query time and space. As an immediate
application of our results, we obtain optimal time solutions for several
document retrieval problems. The method of the paper could be also of
independent interest.
