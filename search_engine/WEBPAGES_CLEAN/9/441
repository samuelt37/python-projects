24.2 oeistream 
 

 
All of the  oestream  classes that provide input handling derive from this
class. This class provides efficient implementations of standard input stream
functions at the byte level:  getbyte, get, skipbyte, peekbyte ; at the
data buffer level:  read, skip ; and at the text level:  getline,
skipline, gettoken . Like the standard  istreams , the     operator is
overloaded for easy assignment of data from text streams.

  
This class also provides the framework but not fully functional implementations
of the  open  and  close  routines. However, if a data buffer already
exists in memory, an  oeistream  instance can be used to read from that
buffer using the provided  open  and  close  routines.

  
    char      buffer[] = "hello world!";
oeistream is;

if (is.open(buffer, 12))
{
    while (is)
    {
       int c = is.getbyte();
       oeout &lt;&lt; c;
    }
    is.close();
}
