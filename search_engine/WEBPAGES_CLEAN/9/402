   Wait Statement  
        Sequential Statement 
 ---- used in ----&gt; 
 Process Procedure 
            Syntax        
  

 
     wait until condition;      wait on signal_list;      wait for time;      wait;      
  



 
See LRM section 8.1

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The  wait until  form suspends a process until a change occurs
on one or more of the signals in the statement and the condition is
evaluated to be true. A rising edge on NET_DATA_VALID and three rising
edges on CLK must occur for this process to cycle:
 READ_NET: process
begin
  wait until NET_DATA_VALID = '1';
  NET_DATA_READ &lt;= '1';
  wait until CLK='1';
  wait until CLK='1';
  NET_BUFFER &lt;= NET_DATA_IN;
  wait until CLK='1';
  NET_DATA_READ &lt;= '0';
end process READ_NET;  
    
  

 
    The  'event  term in the following form of
wait statement is in fact redundant, but is required by many synthesis
tools:
 WAIT_PROC: process
begin
  wait until CLK'event and CLK='1';
  Q1 &lt;= D1;
end process;  
    
  

 
    The  wait on  form is equivalent to a sensitivity
list. These processes will behave identically:
 process (A,B)
begin
  -- sequential statements
end process;

process
begin
  -- identical statements
  wait on A,B; 
end process; 
    The  wait  statement  cannot  be used:
  In a process with a sensitivity list
  In a procedure called from a process with a sensitivity list.
  In a function
  In a procedure called from a function
   
  Wait for  and  wait  are useful in behavioural models and
test benches.  Wait  on it's own suspends a process indefinitely:
 STIMULUS: process
begin
    EN_1   &lt;= '0';
    EN_2   &lt;= '1';
  wait for 10 ns;
    EN_1   &lt;= '1';
    EN_2   &lt;= '0';
  wait for 10 ns;
    EN_1 &lt;= '0';
  wait for 10 ns;
  wait; -- end of test
end process STIMULUS; 
 
    
  

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    Most logic synthesis tools only support a single  wait until 
(clock edge expression) statement in a "clocked process".
 
Some tools support a single  wait on  statement as an alternative
to a sensitive list in a "combinational process".
  
 Wait for , unconditional  wait  and wait statements in
procedures are not supported.
  
    
  

 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, a wait statement may have a label.
