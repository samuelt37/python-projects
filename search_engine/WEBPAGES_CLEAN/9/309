  Welcome to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository!  






 We currently maintain 360 data sets as a service to the machine learning community.
You may   view all data sets   through our 
searchable interface.  Our  old web 
site  
is still available, for those who prefer the old format.  For a general overview of the Repository, please visit our  About page .
For information about citing data sets in publications, please read our  citation policy .  If you wish to donate a data set, please consult our  donation policy .
For any other questions, feel free to  contact the Repository librarians . 

 We have also set up a  mirror site  for the Repository.
