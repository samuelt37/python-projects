  Exact MAR: Time vs. Instances Solved Results 
     We first show nine plots, one for each benchmark class that was run. Note that some solvers do not accept Markov networks as input and are shown as constant 0 in these cases.                
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
         The overall results, for all benchmark sets. Note that this does not take into account the vastly differing number of benchmark set sizes as well as the fact that some solvers don't work on Markov networks.
