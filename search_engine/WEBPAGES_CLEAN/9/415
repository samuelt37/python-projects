  Library Modules and Programming 
All programmers must be able to use library modules when programming.
This means they must be able to read the documentation for these modules and
  understand how to use the names they define.
Typical library modules define functions or classes: some define both.
This page is an index to the documentaiton of all the modules that I will ask
  you to install in the  courselib  folder in your Eclipse workspace.
We will use some of these modules in the course
 
If you are interested in reading the code in some of these modules, to learn
  how they work (the more Python you know the better), you can either use
  Eclipse to examine the  .py  files in the  courselib  folder
  (but don't change them!) or click the link (second on the upper-right of
  the documentation page) which switches the browser to dispaly the  .py 
  file.
