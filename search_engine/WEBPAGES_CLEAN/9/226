      Influences: A single factor that makes an outcome more likely:
 
  (easier 	(strong-actor)	(inflate balloon))
  (easier	(more-elastic)	(inflate balloon))
       Inference Rules: How to recognize when factors are present
 
  (act stretch)  	?	(more-elastic)
  (old-actor) 	?	(strong-actor)
  (age adult) 	?	(old-actor)
