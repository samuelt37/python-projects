 Abstract  
This paper characterizes connectionist-type architectures 
that allow a distributed solution
for classes of constraint-satisfaction problems.
The main issue addressed is whether there exists 
a uniform model of computation (where
all nodes are indistinguishable) that guarantees 
convergence to a solution from every initial 
state of the system, whenever such a solution 
exists. We show that even for relatively
simple constraint networks, such as rings, there
is no general solution using a completely uniform, 
asynchronous, model. However, some
restricted topologies like trees can accommodate 
the uniform, asynchronous, model and a
protocol demonstrating this fact is presented.
An almost-uniform, asynchronous, networkconsistency 
protocol is also presented. We show
that the algorithms are guaranteed to be selfstabilizing, 
which makes them suitable for dynamic or error-prone environments.
