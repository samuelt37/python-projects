                          Google the term – coined by former GE CEO Jack Welch – and you’ll learn that it’s
                              most often applied in business to explain an organization that throws caution to the
                              wind, scrapping boundaries and bureaucracies in order to tap the internal power of
                              its people to directly enact change. For the past 50 years, the UCI School of Social
                              Sciences has been putting this approach into practice, breaking down traditional barriers
                              to create change in society, economies and human well-being. But never has this boundaryless-mindset
                              been more important than today.
