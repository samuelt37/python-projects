Automated Reasoning

 Abstract  
The class of algorithms for approximating 
reasoning tasks presented in this paper is based on
approximating the general bucket elimination
framework. The algorithms have adjustable
levels of accuracy and efficiency, and they can
be applied uniformly across many areas and
problem tasks. We introduce these algorithms
in the context of combinatorial optimization
and probabilistic inference.
