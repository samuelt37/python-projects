     Brief description:  
CATS is a set of tools for statically analyzing concurrent programs.
        The analyses are performed on the task interaction concurrency graph
        (TICG), an enhanced reachability graph.  CATS includes a TICG builder,
        deadlock checker, model checker for verifying temporal logic
        assertions, and support tools such as a task interaction graph viewer.
 
     Evaluation against applicable general dimensions: 
 
     Availability: commercial/licensed/public domain  
Cost-free license from UCI Arcadia project.
 
     Cost:  
Free if obtained over the Internet, media charge for magnetic tape.
 
     Degree of support/maturity/testing/usage:  
Limited support; used within the project to analyze some large
        concurrent programs, including the Chiron UIMS.

     Computing platforms:  
Sun 4
 
     Language compatibilities:  
Suitable for programs using Ada-style rendezvous; tasking structure
        is expressed using task interaction graphs (TIGs) which are now
        constructed manually, though a TIG extractor for Ada code is under
        development.
