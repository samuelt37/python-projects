  Hyperweb Server Documentation  

 Background 

 The Hyperweb Server provides access to the Chimera 2.0 hyperwebs stored on a Chimera website. The Hyperweb Server's chief responsibility is the maintenance of a Chimera 2.0 hyperweb's persistence and consistency. In addition, it communicates hypermedia information (via its API) to Chimera Servers which connect to it on behalf of their clients. 

 As a system administration tool, the Hyperweb Server provides operations to export and import Chimera hyperwebs. These hyperwebs can be exported or imported individually or as a set. In addition, for each Chimera website, the hyperweb server maintains a database that tracks information about the viewers, objects, and views referenced by the anchors and links in the website's hyperwebs. The information in this database is available globally across all of the hyperwebs at a particular Chimera website. This database is known as the VOV (for Viewers, Objects, and Views) and it can be imported and exported as well. 

 User-Interface 

 The Hyperweb Server's user-interface is contained within a single window that localizes its operations and status information. Each Menu and Tab of the user-interface is explained through the links below.
