Colors in Ucigame are specified in one of two ways:
 
  With three numbers, indicating the red, green, and blue components.
  With one number, indicating white, black, or a shade of gray.
   
In both cases, the number or number range from 0 to 255.
Other values have no meaning.
 
 
Here are some examples with three numbers:
 
    255, 0, 0					    	   Pure, maximum red
     0, 255, 0					    	   Pure, maximum green
     0, 0, 255					    	   Pure, maximum blue
     255, 255, 255  	    	   White: all colors at maximum
     0, 0, 0					    	   Black: all colors at minimum
     255, 64, 164				    	   Full red, some green and blue
     255, 128, 128				    	   Full red, medium green and blue
     255, 192, 192				    	   Full red, lots o' green and blue
     128, 128, 128				    	   Equal amounts of three colors yields a shade of gray
     255, 255, 0				    	   Yellow is red plus green
     255, 0, 255				    	   Purple is red plus blue

     128, 0, 0					    	   Dark red
     128, 128, 0				    	   Dark yellow
    
Here are some examples with one number:
