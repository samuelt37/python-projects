    Course Description
  and Prerequisites    
       
    205 Human-Computer  Interaction  (4).  The design and evaluation of
  interfaces to computer systems and applications with special attention to their
  fit to human cognitive capabilities and organizational practices. Includes
  coverage of hypermedia, groupware, and other rapidly emerging developments. 
         
    Informal Course
  Description    
       
   This is a graduate level introduction to the field of
  human-computer interaction, a very broad and interdisciplinary field relevant
  to many courses of study from computer and industrial design to software
  engineering and ubiquitous computing. The class will be carried out in a way
  to help you with your graduate studies. The assignments and final exam will
  help prepare you for the kinds of questions and writing you will need to do
  for qualifying exams and graduate level presentations. The papers will for
  the most part give you a common language that researchers in the field expect
  you to be conversant in. Some of the historical papers will surprise you in
  the kinds of visions they encompassed, laying out research agendas that are
  yet to be fulfilled. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Policies

  that may be important to you. 
       
    Attendance:  You
  may miss two scheduled classes without explanation�but this is not a
  requirement that you skip. 
       
    Web Page and Readings:  The Web
  page for the class, particularly the list of reading is subject to update.
  Check it frequently and be sure to refresh / reload the Web pages when you
  brose them. If a reading is added the day of a class, students are not
  responsible for it until the next class. 
       
    Email
  correspondence:  All email to me must include the class number, 205, in
  the subject line. If you do not get a response to the email in 72 hours,
  resend it. 
       
   
   
       
   
    
         
   
   
    Course Mechanics and
  Grading    
       
    Lectures  will
  focus on assigned readings but allow ample time for class participation as
  described below. 
       
    Readings    will be assigned for each lecture.
  Students will be asked to prepare a weekly,  three-page commentary  (two pages of text plus citations on a
  third page) about the class readings. The theme of the commentary will vary
  and will be announced. Commentaries will be due the Thursday following a week
  of lectures that form the basis. Some of the commentaries will require
  additional references. Pages are double-spaced with  a 
  11 or 12 point Times Roman or 10 point Arial / Tahoma font. For citations,
  you may use a form that is familiar to you but be consistent. APA, IEEE, ACM
  are some common approaches (see links page). 
       
    Class participation
   includes attendance and being able to comment relevantly on the readings.
  In addition, students will be asked to pair up and present a paper from the
  readings via a  power point
  presentation.  
       
    Final exam  will
  follow the format of a �Phase 2� exam question and will be in-class. It will
  be based on the readings and closely linked to some of the commentary
  assignments.
