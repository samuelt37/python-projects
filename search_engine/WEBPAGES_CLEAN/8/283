            Postdoctoral Researcher 
            Department of Computer Science 
            Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics 
             Baldi group  
             
            I study machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning with artificial neural networks. 
             
             
            My research includes a number of machine learning applications in the natural sciences, including the prediction of chemical reactions and the analysis of data from high-energy physics.
