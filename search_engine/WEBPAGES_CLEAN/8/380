			  What We Are  About  
 
    What do we do at EVOKE Lab &amp; Studio?</strong>   
 
 We start with an eye toward social issues and concerns, and integrate social theory, art, computer science, and design to create new technologies and artifacts that evoke thought, debate, discussion, and consideration of a more harmonious mediated world. Our projects range from small experiments with new innovations to large-scale studies on major issues like “big data”, privacy, social justice, and self-exploration through technology. We are an open community of interdisciplinary scholars and designers who have fun, learn, and grow together, and are always looking for more fellow travelers! 
 
 
 
    Where do we work?</strong>   
 
 We are located at the UC-Irvine campus in the Calit2 Building. While our research work takes us everywhere, and our field sites are varied and far-flung, much of our work takes place in the EVOKE Lab &amp; Studio itself. Our Design Lab is modeled after the workflow of the User Experience (UX) design process, taking ideas from inception to formal design specs. When it’s time to start building, projects shift into the larger, adjacent Studio space where we move from idea to physical reality. See below for more details on what we have in the Lab &amp; Studio. 
 
 
   
 
     The EVOKE Lab 
 Where the creative work happens, the Lab is set up to support UX design workflow from blue-sky sessions to conceptual prototyping.  Find out more about what’s in the EVOKE Lab.  
 
   
 
     Values in Design 
 How do technologies reflect our human values? How do we design social values into our technologies and systems? Our Values in Design research track explores these questions.  Learn more about our VID research.  
 
   
 
     Data/Self 
 Devices and sensors are making it easier to track ourselves and turn our bodies, activities, and choices into analytics. It’s changing what it means to know ourselves.   Learn more about our work on the Data and the Self.  
 
   
 
     The EVOKE Studio 
 Projects move out of the Lab and to the Studio to take on material forms. Our “big black box” space is perfect for exhibits, performances, large construction, and anything the imagination can conjure.  Find out more about the EVOKE Studio.  
 
   
 
     Knowledge Infrastructures 
 Scientific infrastructures are well understood to carry data and information, but how do they foster the creation of useful  knowledge ? Can we generative better systems and associated policy frameworks that cultivate knowledge-centered communities and initiatives?  Learn more about our work on Knowledge Infrastructures.  
 
   
 
     Emerging Configurations of Knowledge 
 Although the book and journal article are the standard forms of scholarly communication, we give form to knowledge through a much broader range of expression. Our research explores emerging forms of communication through new technologies.  See more about our work on Emerging Configurations of Knowledge .

   Workshops &amp; Special Events   
 
 In the EVOKE Lab &amp; Studio, we frequently put on workshops related to design, computing, social theory, etc. Sometimes it’ll be a skills workshop, other times a gaming session, reading group, or interesting speaker series. Often, the event will be in the EVOKE Lab, but sometimes we also have events at other locations. Keep an eye on our upcoming events and join us! 
 
 
 
   Day-to-Day Happenings   
 
 The Lab &amp; Studio are in constant activity with faculty and students working on projects, meeting, studying, and doing what we all do. We’re not a secret society, so if the door is open, come on in. Drop in anytime to see what’s going on!

					 A while back I stumbled upon a browser game which in some ways could be considered an attempt to gamify privacy literacy. Gamification in the context of surveillance usually means the exploitation of the pleasures of play in order to collect and sell data, i.e. in fitness or productivity apps. In a somewhat similar vein, a group of […]

					 Overlooking a recent technology article on BBC news (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24332358), I read about how a Japanese research lab is developing a system to allow users (via augemnted reality) to be able to see the translation of writing in the environment. Naturally, its intended application is to allowing users to see the their foreign surroundings in a […]

					 Although the 24-hour news cycle has recently moved on from Snowden and  surveillance to cover the latest set of unfortunate circumstances on Capitol Hill, there are some points I would like to make regarding the role of surveillance in the further dissolution of any sense of a human author that might underlie the use of […]
