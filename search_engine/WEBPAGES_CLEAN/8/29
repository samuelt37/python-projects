The main focus of my past research was SimSE, an educational software engineering simulation environment whose goal is to allow software engineering students to learn and practice the software engineering process in a graphical, realistic, fully interactive, and entertaining setting. See the   SimSE Website   for more information.        University of California, Irvine    Copyright © 2014
