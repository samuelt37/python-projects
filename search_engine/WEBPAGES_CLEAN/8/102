    Feedback     
         Any 
action of the user should lead to an immediate reaction of the system (ideally 
after no more than 0.1 seconds)      Examples:   
 
   Menu entries, object icons, 
etc. should become highlighted when being touched by the cursor.      
   
    Selected items in menus should 
be marked.  
   Path 
selection in navigation hierarchy should be visualized.                                         
      Errors in user 
input should be reported immediately.     System 
should inform the user about the status with status indicators, e.g.  
     clock with 
rotating hands  
      description of what is going on         , and  
      even better progress indicators  (e.g., 
bar that progressivly indicates task completion).   
                                          
       Feedback can be visual, auditory and tactile.    
(users 
should be able to turn off auditory output)   
    System reactions should always have about the same latency.
