&gt; Decorated URLs in the MKS style may suffice for the simple versioning
&gt; needs. But I suspect we'll want to look at an additional HTTP method --
&gt; call it SET_CONFIG -- to tell a server, "Now switch to serving the
&gt; 'tables-no-frames' version of the pages."

HTTP already has ample mechanisms to deal with multiple configurations
of content. And the presumption must be that there is no _state_, so
the notion of "switching to" some usage perspective won't work.

You might want to look over the content negotiation parts of the
HTTP/1.1 spec from:

         http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/ 

I'm troubled by the 'decorate URL' style of version referencing, but
the alternatives ("add additional HTTP methods") seems worse. I
suppose if a version is something that you want to be able to talk
about, then it should have its own URL.
