 Abstract  
GSAT is a randomized greedy local repair procedure that was introduced for solving 
propositional satisfiability and constraint satisfaction problems. We present an 
improvement to GSAT that is sensitive to the problem's structure. When the problem 
has a tree structure the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution in linear time. 
For non-tree networks, the algorithm designates a subset of nodes, called cutset, and
executes a regular GSAT algorithm on this set of variables. On all the rest of the 
variables it executes a specialized local search algorithm for trees. This algorithm 
finds an assignment that, like GSAT, locally minimizes the sum of unsatisfied 
constraints and also globally minimizes the number of conflicts in every tree-like 
sub-network. We will present results of experiments showing that this new algorithm 
outperforms regular GSAT on sparse networks whose cycle-cutset size is bounded by 30% 
of the nodes.
