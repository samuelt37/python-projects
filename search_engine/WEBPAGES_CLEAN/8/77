Maximum General Assignment Problems

Abstract:
  
The authors show that for any separable assignment problem (SAP), if there 
exists an B-approximation algorithm for solving the single bin case, then 
there is an LP-based algorithm that yields an (1-1/e - 
ε)-approximation and a local search algorithm with a 
(1/2-ε)-approximation.

A SAP is defined as follows:  Given a set of bins and items to pack into 
bins, a value  f_ij  for assigning item  j  to bin  i , and a separate packing 
constraint on each bin (defined by a set of subsets of items that fit into 
bin  i ), find the packing that maximizes the aggregate value.
