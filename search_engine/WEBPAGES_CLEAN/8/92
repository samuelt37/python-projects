       New walkthrough models are becoming increasingly larger everyday and
  it's not feasible to keep the whole model in the main memory anymore.
  Therefore out-of-core techniques are required to keep the data on hard disk
  and achieve interactive frame rates at the same time. We are investigating
  several directions in this area including:    
     1.      
      Novel disk layouts to minimize the hard disk seek     
    time    
     2.      
      Novel in-core data structures that can effectively     
    index the out-of-core data    
     3.      
      Storing pre-processed data in order to minimize     
    the CPU workload
