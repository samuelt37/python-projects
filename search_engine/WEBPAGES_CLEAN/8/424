 Academic Advising 

 
 

 It is the  student's  responsibility to make decisions about his/her educational and career goals. 
 Academic counselors are here to help students work towards those goals, and academic advising is an intentional partnership between the student and his/her advisor(s) in which the shared goal is the student’s academic success. 
 Below is information on when, why, and how often to see academic advising, whether you come during  walk-in hours or for an appointment . 
 For information regarding academic advising workshops and student org meetings, check out our  SAO Events Calendar . 
   
    
    »</strong>  Meet with an Academic Advisor </strong> 
  Whenever you have a question about your academic standing, progress, or goals 
 Once a quarter, or at least once a year, to make sure you are on track 
 Three quarters  before  your intended graduation date 
    
    »</strong>  Some Benefits of Consistent Academic Advising Meetings </strong> 
  Be confident that you are on track for graduation 
 Receive assistance with short- and long-term goal setting 
 Get help with planning and selecting courses to meet your academic and career goals 
 Obtain referrals to and advice about campus resources and opportunities 
 Gain clarification on University and School policies and procedures 
    
    »</strong>  While Meeting with an Advisor </strong> 
  Arrive on time (if meeting during a scheduled appointment) 
 Come prepared with questions and concerns 
 Honestly discuss your goals, interests, and priorities 
 Keep an open mind to consider the options presented to you 
 Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand something 
    
    »</strong>  What it is a Study Plan, and Why Should You Have One?</strong> 
 A Study Plan maps out of the courses and/or units you would need to take in the upcoming academic year(s) in order to make progress on your degree requirements. 
  It presents a bird's eye view of your course load and potential academic commitments over the year 
 It allows you to make quick adjustments to your schedule and plan ahead 
 It can help reduce stress when enrolling for classes 
 Use this helpful  academic plan worksheet . 
    
    »</strong>  Tips for Building a Study Plan</strong> 
  Know what classes you need to take. These include courses that satisfy University and School Requirements, as well as any core courses required for your major. 
 Make special note of any required classes that are only offered once a year or once every other year, or must be taken in a specific order. 
 Pay attention to course prerequisites, and know which ones you have cleared. If you need to submit a prerequisite clearing request, take care of it in advance. 
 Use the tentative academic year course plan when mapping out your year. But keep in mind that this course plan is tentative, so some of the elective classes you were hoping to take may be cancelled or conflict with each other. 
 Be prepared to be flexible!
