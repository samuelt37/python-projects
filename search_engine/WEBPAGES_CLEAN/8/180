The MHCID program is housed in the Department of Informatics at UC Irvine, a leading department in the intersection of people, design, and technology. The department is home to four ACM fellows, four members of the CHI Academy, three endowed chairs, and numerous winners of other prestigious awards. The MCHID program draws faculty members from a myriad of backgrounds to create a rich environment in which students can draw upon a wide range of expertise. Faculty come from across UCI and from industry. Students in the MHCID program will have the opportunity to interact closely with these faculty and with prestigious members of the industry advisory board.
