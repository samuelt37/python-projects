 Informatics 45 Spring 2010 
   Schedule 

 

 

  The schedule is a work-in-progress that will be built as we go along, depending on our progress (and, perhaps toward the end, your areas of interest).  I will try to keep the lecture schedule and readings at least a week ahead of us, so you'll know to expect, at least in the short term. 

 There will sometimes be online readings associated with lectures.  We will generally be talking about them, or about the issues raised in them, in lecture; it's best to do the readings before the lecture, so that you can participate in the discussion and get the most out of your time.
