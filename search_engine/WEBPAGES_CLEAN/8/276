   3rd Place</strong>  ($1,500 sponsored by Northwind Ventures)</strong>  
  Product Name: </strong>VideoOnTheWall 
  Product Description:</strong> VideoOnTheWall gives everyday people the ability to become "news reporters" on the Internet.  
 Users capture footage via the camera functionality on a cell phone and transmit to our servers.  
 These streaming news reports can be viewed by anyone on the Internet live. The experience is interactive. A trusted network of viewers can send real-time messages to the reporters for instant feedback.  
 The system ushers social web interaction to the next level. Reporters can have their own personal page with all their previous video casts, which can spur a following for the most popular reporters, in the same way in which people follow popular bloggers.
