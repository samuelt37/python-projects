8.6 OEFormat 
 

 
The OEFormat namespace is used to encode symbolic constants
representing the molecular file formats that may be read or written by
OEChem.  The symbol OEFormat::UNDEFINED has the value zero
indicating an unrecognized or undefined file format.

  
The symbol OEFormat::MAXFORMAT is defined as the last value plus
one, allowing the convenient declaration of fixed sized arrays and
range checking.

  
    
namespace OEFormat {
  const unsigned int UNDEFINED =  0;
  const unsigned int SMI       =  1;
  const unsigned int MDL       =  2;
  const unsigned int PDB       =  3;
  const unsigned int MOL2      =  4;
  const unsigned int BIN       =  5;
  const unsigned int TDT       =  6;
  const unsigned int ISM       =  7;
  const unsigned int MOL2H     =  8;
  const unsigned int SDF       =  9;
  const unsigned int CAN       = 10;
  const unsigned int MF        = 11;
  const unsigned int XYZ       = 12;
  const unsigned int FASTA     = 13;
