 Abstract  
The paper presents algorithm directional resolution, a variation on the original 
Davis-Putnam algorithm, and analyzes its worst-case behavior as a function of the 
topological structure on the theories. Th notions of induced width and diversity 
are shown to play a key role in bounding the complexity of the procedure. 
The inportance of our analysis lies in highlighting structure-based tractable classes 
of satisfiability and in providing theoretical guarantees on the time and space complexity 
of the algorithm. Contrary to previous assesments, we show that for many theories directional 
resolution could be an effective procedure. Our empirical test confirm theoretical prediction, 
showing that on problems with special structures, like chains, directional resolution greatly 
outperforms one of the most effective satisfiability algorithms known to date, namely the 
popular Davis-Puntnam procedure.
