            Java Hash Tables in Matlab    
        
           
               I usually use Perl for text processing since its very easy to create regular expressions and hash tables.  It seems Matlab can do these things as well.  For instance, one can create a Java Hashtable in Matlab:   &gt;&gt; ht = java.util.Hashtable(); &gt;&gt; ht.put('art',123); &gt;&gt; ht.get('art')  ans =   123    One can also call other methods, such as contains() or size(), on the Java Hashtable object (see  API ).  I had not realized that it is possible to  instantiate Java objects  in Matlab!  However, Matlab's hash table does seem to be noticeably slower than Perl's hash table.
