       NOTE: Problems from Walrand or Tanenbaum are on the   "Non-textbook problems" handout . (Don't do the problems on this handout that are not listed below.)

        the switch is free, but the links are not. In the second part ("for which
        values of d"), neither the switch nor the links are free. Also give the
      resulting total costs in each case.
