    UC IRVINE - ICS 125 PROJECT IN SYSTEM DESIGN 
     PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
     
      
This project is about building a networked calendaring system for a
PDA that would enable sorting for different categories. I.e., each
calendar day would have, e.g., 5 different variables, and the sorting
could be done on each variable. E.g., one variable could be location,
another oculd be sales amount.

Magi is one possible platform for this project.
