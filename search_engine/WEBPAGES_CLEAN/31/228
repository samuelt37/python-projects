  Reconfigurability Scripts  
      
 
     A reconfigurability script consists of the following
 
  Bounds of when monitoring statistics should be examined (this is based on compile time profile &amp; analysis information regarding execution time and expected bottlenecks/potential reconfigurability gains.
  Several options of how to reconfigure, depending on several expected values for the monitor statistics. These typically include: 
  A worst case scenario: if thereï¿½s no meaningful way to improve performance based on the accessing patterns found. 
  A best case scenario: if accessing paterns are found at RT to be very regular and predictable despite CT appearances. 
  One or more intermediate cases, favoring one or the other of the monitored parameters.
