             Database Schema 
                 
                     
                           Source :
                                Vendors and other sources of chemical information.
                               ChemicalMix :
                                Individual records available from sources. These may
                                not be individual chemicals, but rather a mixture of chemicals
                                available as a unit.
                               Source2ChemicalMix :
                                Resolution table between sources and chemical mixes.
                                This accounts for multiple sources providing the same
                                chemical mixtures, without storing redundant data.
                               Annotation :
                                High-level chemical annotations that the sources
                                provide, likely extracted from SD Tags of the SDF molecule
                                files the source data came from. These are the secondary
                                annotations which vary depending on the source.
                               Chemical :
                                Individual chemical components of chemical
                                mixes that cannot be further resolved into components.
                                These include the derived primary annotations which are pre-computed
                                and stored in the database to facilitate future searches and
                                computations.
                               MixtureComponent :
                                Similar to Source2ChemicalMix, resolution
                                table between ChemicalMix and Chemical, to avoid
                                storage of redundant Chemical information.
                               Isomer3d :
                                Stereochemistry specific chemical representations with
                                predicted 3D structural information / atom coordinates.
                                Multiple 3D conformation records may exist here for any
                                single record in the Chemical table, one for every
                                possible isomeric configuration the chemical can exist in.
