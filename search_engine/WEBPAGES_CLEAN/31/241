 UCI  ICS 1C , Summer 1996, Homework 2 
 12 - 19 August  1996, Labs 3-5.    Due Monday, 19 August. 
 
Using 
 
 http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/doc/hw2skel.html   
as a basis, create an HTML document with the following content:
    Your name, e-mail address and major.
   The names and e-mail addresses of your team members
  who have reviewed your document.
   Three items of interest in an academic area (e.g. Humanities,
  Social Ecology, etc.) that you have found on the Web,
  with a brief statement about each item of interest, and include
  a link to each item that will let us get directly to your sources.
   Five questions that you could not have answered at the
  start of this quarter, but that you can answer now and the
  answers to these questions. 
  At least 2 of these 5 questions should be directly related
  to the content of this course, and at least 2 others should
  be directly related to your major or (if you are unaffiliated)
  an academic area you are considering as your major. 
  Each answer should be at least 80 words long and contain
  at least 2 links to other documents on the Web.
   
You will submit this assignment during lab on Monday, 19 August
following instructions which will be available at that time.

  
Grading will be on the basis of content,
the effective use of correct and clear writing,
and how you choose to present the 
information so that it includes an appropriate use of the technology.

  
Your choice of questions is an important and influential part of
the content.  The teaching staff is happy (make that eager) to
help you select ``good'' questions.  In fact, it's a good idea
(but not a requirement) to discuss your questions with one of the
staff shortly after you start to work on this assignment.
