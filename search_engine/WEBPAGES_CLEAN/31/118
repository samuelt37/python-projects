  Replicators : B358/S23467 

 I found this replicator on Oct. 25, 2001. It repeats every 11
generations, on a one-dimensional 4-unit grid. 

     

 This rule has only  one known
spaceship . It is unknown whether the replicator can lead to
high-period oscillators, spaceships, guns, or other interesting
technology.
