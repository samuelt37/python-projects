						 Individuals are tracking a variety of health-related data via a growing number of wearable devices and smartphone apps. More and more data relevant to health are also being captured passively as people communicate with one another on social networks, shop, work, or do any number of activities that leave “digital footprints.” Self-tracking data can provide better measures of everyday behavior and lifestyle and can fill in gaps in more traditional clinical data collection, giving us a more complete picture of health. 
 The  Health Data Exploration project  is a collaboration between EVOKE and researchers at UCSD/Calit2, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. We conducted a study to better understand the barriers to using personal health data in research from the individuals who track the data about their own personal health, the companies that market self-tracking devices, apps or services and aggregate and manage that data, and the researchers who might use the data as part of their research.  This research was published as a report, “Personal Data for the Public Good,” in March 2014 by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
