 Best-first AND/OR Search for 0/1 Integer Programming 

 Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
AND/OR search spaces are a unifying paradigm for advanced algorithmic
schemes for graphical models. The main virtue of this representation is
its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can translate into exponential
time savings for search algorithms. In this paper we introduce an AND/OR search
algorithm that explores a context-minimal AND/OR search graph in a best-first
manner for solving 0/1 Integer Linear Programs (0/1 ILP). We also extend to the
0/1 ILP domain the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search with caching
algorithm which was recently proposed by [1] for solving optimization tasks in
graphical models. The effectiveness of the best-first AND/OR search approach
compared to the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search is demonstrated
on a variety of benchmarks for 0/1 ILPs, including instances from the MIPLIB
library, real-world combinatorial auctions, random uncapacitated warehouse location
problems and MAX-SAT instances.
