The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

Discusses the expected behavior of Delaunay triangulations for
points chosen uniformly at random (without edge effects).
The main result is that within a region containing  n  points,
the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor
of log  n  / log log  n.

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O( k )
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving  m  or  n 
to one involving min( m,   k ) or min( n,   k )
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the  k  smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order ( k +1) Voronoi diagrams.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.
  
In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.
  
In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have  total length within a constant factor of
optimal . Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see " Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation " for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that  any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices .
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper " Mesh generation and optimal triangulation ".

(special issue on computational geometry).
 
Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
 linear programming 
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in " Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers ",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Given a collection of  n  sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
 linear programming ,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both  n  and  d.

    Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

Given a set of points with weights that are not known precisely,
but are known to fall within some range, considers the possible
weighted centroids arising from different choices of weights
in each range.  The combinatorics of this problem are closely
connected with those of
 zonotopes .

Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select  k  points that can be connected by a
small
 spanning tree .  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable  k );
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on  n  is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in
quadtrees, and a general technique
based on that in " Iterated nearest neighbors "
for reducing the dependence
on  n  in any approximation algorithm.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for  empirical
network analysis  and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n c ), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least

related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

    Global optimization of mesh quality . 
D. Eppstein. 
Tutorial at
10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.
 
Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212007 .  
 19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281 .
 
We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds.

    Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs .

New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for

For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2 α(n)  log 2 n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
 quasiconvex programming , and is used

other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented

one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

that is, given a drawing, choosing to draw one edge as upper and one
lower at each crossing in order to improve the drawing's readability.

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in  straight skeleton  construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

A  straight skeleton  is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

Information Systems (ACM GIS 2008) , Article 16  (best paper award). 
Invited talk at INFORMS 2009, San Diego.
 
We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

We consider problems of determining when a curve in the plane is the
projection of a 3d surface with no vertical tangents. Several problems
of this type are NP-complete, but can be solved in polynomial time if a
casing of the curve is also given.

New York, 2009, pp. 150–159 .   SIAM J. Computing  39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010 .
 
If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.
  
    Dilation, smoothed distance, and minimization diagrams of

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

paper award). 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.
 
We provide an O(n 3  log 2 n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

stripification, optimal angular resolution, and metric embedding.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper  Algorithms for Drawing Media . Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a  Manhattan orbifold  and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L 1  plane.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist  Mark Lombardi , we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the  Lombardi
Spirograph , is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

Information Systems (ACM GIS 2010) , San Jose, California, pp. 13–22 .  arXiv:1009.1904 .
 
An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
 P  is  O ( n   d  ), independent
of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell

of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

We show that a partial order has a non-crossing upward planar drawing if
and only if it has order dimension two, and we use the
Dedekind-MacNeille completion to find a drawing with the minimum
possible number of confluent junctions.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties

We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,

graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103  .
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

Applications  19 (2): 619–656, 2015 .
 
We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.
  
    Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.

Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

Algorithms  36: 18–26, 2016 .  
If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a

changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of

the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.
