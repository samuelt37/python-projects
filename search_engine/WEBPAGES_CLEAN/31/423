on graphs of maximum degree three and four.
We also consider related problems including counting the number of
Hamiltonian cycles in such graphs.

approximation algorithms for iceberg range queries and for various

    Minimum dilation stars.  
D. Eppstein and
 K. Wortman .  arXiv:cs.CG/0412025 .  21st ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Pisa, 2005, pp. 321–326.   Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  37 (1): 27–37, 2007 .
 
We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2 α(n)  log 2 n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
 quasiconvex programming , and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

    Drawings of planar graphs with few slopes and segments.   V. Dujmović ,

and
 D. R. Wood .  arXiv:math.CO/0606450 .   Comp.
Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  38: 194–212, 2007. 
 
We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).
  
    Guard placement for efficient point-in-polygon proofs.

and
 N. Sitchinava .  arXiv:cs.CG/0603057 .  23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 27–36.
 
The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.
  
    Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0604034 .  18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(3): Article 29, 2009 .
 
We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

    Interconnect criticality driven delay relaxation.   L. Singhal ,
 E. Bozorgzadeh ,
and D. Eppstein.  IEEE Trans. CAD  26 (10): 1803–1817, 2007.
 
We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.
  
    Upright-quad drawing of st-planar learning spaces.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0607094 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 282–293 .   J. Graph Algorithms and Applications  12 (1): 51–72 , 2008 (special
issue for GD'06).
 
We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

    Trees with convex faces and optimal angles.   J. Carlson
and D. Eppstein.   arXiv:cs.CG/0607113 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 77–88 .
 
We consider drawings of trees which, if the leaf edges were extended to
infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

    Choosing colors for geometric graphs via color space embeddings.   M. Dillencourt ,
D. Eppstein, and
 M. T. Goodrich .  arXiv:cs.CG/0609033 . 
14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 294–305 .
 
We show how to choose colors for the vertices of a graph drawing in such
a way that all colors are easily distinguishable, but such that adjacent
vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

    Happy endings for flip graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0610092 .  23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.   J. Computational Geometry  1 (1): 3–28, 2010 .
 
We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

We show how to solve several versions of the problem of casing graph drawings:
that is, given a drawing, choosing to draw one edge as upper and one
lower at each crossing in order to improve the drawing's readability.

    Space-efficient straggler identification in round-trip data
streams via Newton's identitities and invertible Bloom filters.  
D. Eppstein, and
 M. T. Goodrich .  10th Worksh. Algorithms and Data Structures,  Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2007. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  4619, 2007, pp. 637–648.  arXiv:0704.3313 .   IEEE
Trans. Knowledge and Data Engineering  23 (2): 297–306, 2011 .
 
We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

We describe tests for whether the union-closure of a set family is
well-graded, and algorithms for finding a minimal well-graded
union-closed superfamily of a given set family.
  
    Recognizing partial cubes in quadratic time . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0705.1025 .  19th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
San Francisco, 2008, pp. 1258–1266.   J. Graph
    Algorithms and Applications  15 (2): 269–293, 2011 .
 
We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a  hypercube , in time
O(n 2 ), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from " algorithms for media ".

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 78–89.   J. Graph Algorithms and Applications  17 (1): 35–55, 2013 .
 
Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including " Algorithms for Media ", " Algorithms for Drawing Media ", " Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces ", and
" The Lattice Dimension of a Graph ".
