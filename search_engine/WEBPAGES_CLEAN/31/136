   ICS-280 Spring 2005, Current Topics in Graphical Models with Focus on
  Genetic Linkage Analysis 
     
  
     
		   Class Reference
		    
	    
	


  	  
			  Classroom: PSCB 220 
				 Day: Wednesday  
				 Time: 2:00 - 4:20pm  
				 Instructor: Rina Dechter -  dechter@ics.uci.edu 
			   The seminar will focus on most recent research papers in graph-based
			reasoning and knowledge representation, as well as on exploring connection
			with focus on two application areas. Genetic Linkage Analysis and 2.
			Transportation Studies. Each student will be engaged in a research project
			and will be required to present relevant papers from the literature as well
			as their own findings. Students will also need to provide a final report for
			their research project.
