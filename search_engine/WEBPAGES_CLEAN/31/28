 SPEW ( http://nideffer.net/proj/spew/)   is a exploration game that filters and re-contextualizes data feeds  from all over the web into a pointed commentary about several current  events. The data arcade, hidden inside the main environment, explores  alternate methods of data presentation through the manipulation of game  parameters from several faithful recreations of well-known video game  classics.

 The WTF?! Project ( http://www.aoedipus.net/)   is a flash-based parody of World of Warcraft. Through the lens of real  world scientists and philosophers trapped in an alternate universe that  is full of self-aware and meta-gaming NPCs, this opening chapter of  WTF?! scratches the surface of a giant canvas of social and economical  ramifications in MMORPGs. A free SDK for the engine (wtf-sdk) is also  available for download.

Through the editors available, users can  create their own side scrolling ARPG by incorporating original graphics  and sound.

    Server Migration: Ubuntu 8.04 LTS 32 bit to Ubuntu 9.10 64 bit ... a tale of woe  

       Wed, 2010-04-21 12:19 — yuzo 
  
   
     Changing from 8.04 LTS to 9.10 server proved to be a non-trivial task. Some problems were due to certain limitations due to the hardware, others were very surprising. This post discusses the issues that came up. 
  
Introduction: 
For our Linux testing environments, we have been using Ubuntu Linux. I have prefered using Ubuntu since I switched from Debian a number of years ago.
