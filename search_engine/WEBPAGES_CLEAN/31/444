 Here is some pseudo-code for Selection Sort.
My version keeps the right portion of the array sorted and
inserts items a[n-2] down to a[0]
The version most commonly seen keeps the right portion of the
array sorted and inserts items a[2] through a[n-1]

InsertionSort:

/* a[0] to a[n-1] is the array to sort */

// items a[i+1] through a[n-1] are assumed to be sorted.
