        BEEM : Bucket Elimination with External Memory    
        Kalev Kask, Rina Dechter and Andrew E. Gelfand     
              Abstract   
   A major limitation of exact inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models is
their extensive memory usage, which often puts real-world problems out of their reach.
In this paper we show how we can extend inference algorithms, particularly Bucket Elim-
ination, a special case of cluster (join) tree decomposition, to utilize disk memory. We pro-
vide the underlying ideas and show promising empirical results of exactly solving large
problems not solvable before.
