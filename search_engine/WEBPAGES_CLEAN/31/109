				 Catalogue Description  
				223 Applied Software Design Techniques (4). Study of concepts, representations, techniques, and case studies 
				in structuring software systems, with an emphasis on design considerations. Topics include static and dynamic 
				system structure, data models, abstractions, naming, protocols and application programmer interfaces.
				  
				 Structure  
				The class will be discussion-oriented. Papers must have been read beforehand, and discussion will be 
				seeded by questions, observations, and assertions from all students in the class.
				  
				 Case Study  
				Each student will perform a case study by adopting one software system that they will use to illustrate 
				the techniques with concrete examples. Based on the case study, a few slides should be prepared weekly that 
				illustrate the findings in the example system.
				  
				 Poster  
				Each student will create a poster, which is based on a new "invention". Specifically, 
				at the end of the quarter each student will present a new technique, a new modeling 
				notation, a new approach, a new tool, or any other new "thing" that they invent as 
				a result of their experience in the class. The technique will not have to be fully 
				demonstrated, but the concept and novelty should be clear from the poster.
				  
				 Grades  
				All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class 
				attendance and participation, (b) questions, obaservations, and assertions that feed
                the discussions in class, (c) case study slides, and (d) poster.

				 Students with Disabilities  
				Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the 
				impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her 
				specific needs.  Also contact the Disability Services Center at 
				(949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such 
				accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
