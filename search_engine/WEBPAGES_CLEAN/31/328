       NOTE: Problems from Walrand or Tanenbaum are on the   "Non-textbook problems" handout . (Don't do the problems on this handout that are not listed below.)  
       Kurose 5th ed. chapter 1 problem P2 / 6th ed. chapter 1 problem P3 
       Kurose 5th ed. chapter 1 problem P3 (use n=4) / 6th ed. chapter 1 problem P4(a-b) 
       Walrand 1st ed. #2.1: Justify your answers. 
       Walrand 1st ed. #2.12: The denominator for B given should read "1 + rho
        + rho^2 / 2! + ...". The "1" was missing on the scanned copy. You should be able to solve for N=1 and N=2 on paper.
      You will need to write a spreadsheet, write a program, or use a graphing calculator to solve for N=3 and N=4.  Interpret your answer for N=1. 
       Tanenbaum 3rd ed. #2.14: Assume that "1-MHz full-duplex" means that
        there is 1MHz capacity in each direction. 
       Tanenbaum 3rd ed. #2.20
