  Ordered Collections: Proposals  
     Two proposals for ordered collections:
 
    Single, server-maintained ordering:
 
  PROPFIND (INDEX) returns resources in order
  Specify resource to come after for ADDREF, DELREF, and PUT methods
  Server is responsible for consistency maintenance
       Multiple, client-maintained orderings:
 
  Orderings are stored in a �order� property
  Can have more than one ordering
  Client is responsible for consistency maintenance
  Works with existing methods, only need to define a new property
