   Approximating the minimum weight Steiner triangulation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 91-55 , ICS, UCI, 1991.   3rd ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,  Orlando, 1992, pp. 48–57 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  11: 163–191, 1994 .
 
 Quadtree  based
 triangulation  gives a large but constant factor
 approximation 
to the minimum weight triangulation of a point set or
convex polygon, allowing extra Steiner points to be added as vertices.
Includes proofs of several bounds on triangulation weight relative to
the  minimum spanning tree  or non-Steiner
triangulation, and a conjecture
that for convex polygons the only points that need to be added are on
the polygon boundary.
