Instructions for downloading SimSE 
For Discussion Sections on 11/7/14      1. Download the  SimSE Player's manual . Read all of it except for Section 5.  2. If you have a laptop that you can bring to discussion, download the inspection game in one of two formats:   	  exe  (for Windows machines)      	  jar  (for Windows or non-Windows machines)   	 For both formats, the download is a zip that consists of a "readme" text file and an executable game (jar or exe), which you can run by simply double-clicking on it. If you do not have the current version of Java installed on your machine, you will have the opportunity to install it when you try to run a game.     If you do not have a laptop to bring to discussion, you can simply join in with someone who does.  You will play the game and answer questions about it in discussion.    </body>
