  Semantics Loss<body>

   Semantics Loss  
    
Abstract data structures:
  
trees, lists, graphs,
  
hash tables, 
  
algorithm specific structures     
scalars, arrays, 
  
structs, pointers    
LOAD�s
  
STORE�s    
Example:
  
assigning X.data, 
  
an integer field of X,
  
a node of type T on an 
  
acyclic linked list    
assigning
  
X.data 
  
an integer
  
field of X, 
  
a node of 
  
type T    
storing
  
integer
