 ICS 261, Winter 2009: 
Data Structures 

 This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
10:00 - 10:50 in ICS 253.
Textbook: Advanced Data Structures, by Peter Brass, available online for
  free from  Brass's web
    site  

 Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (assigned and due each
  Friday), a midterm, and a final exam. As in previous course offerings, courseworks
  will be graded in-class at the start of the class on which they are
  due. Grading will be based 20% on the homework score and 40% on each exam.
