 What is a data structure?

	Module:
		set of variables and subroutines
		encapsulating some interface

	Object-oriented:
		interacting set of objects that implements some functionality


What do we study?

	What sets of operations are commonly needed?

	How can we implement them efficiently?
		(various forms of analysis, amortized, etc)

	How can we form new specialized data structures by combining
	existing ones in simple ways?


Why data structures?
	Theoretical: how do I find a fast algorithm?
	Fast ds = fast alg

		sorting examples -- selection sort =&gt; heap sort; ins sort

	Programming in the small
	(even when overall program does something non-theoretical)

		interval tree for fast tree scrolling example

	Software design principles (modular object oriented design)



Python syntax
    key diffs from C etc:
	no variable declarations
		(data has a type but variables can hold any type data)
	block structure determined by indentation instead of brackets

simple example

    fib = [1, 1]

    def fibonacci(n):
	while n
