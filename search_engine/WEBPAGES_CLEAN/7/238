  Overview 

  We'll examine the relationships between software architectures and application-level 
  Internet protocols. The goal of the class will be to develop a clearly articulated 
  research strategy for getting us to the next major successor of today's WWW. 
  The working hypothesis is that event-based architectures will form the backbone 
  of that endeavor. In terms of topics we'll be looking at:  
  the existing app-level protocols 
    some work in software architecture 
    Roy Fielding's work on architectures as it underlies the design of the 
    modern WWW 
    work in Internet-scale event notification  
  This will be a read-papers-and-present ideas type of seminar.
