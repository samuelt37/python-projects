BounceHouse shows off Ucigame's "pixel perfect" collision
detection.  (If you don't specify pixel perfect, then
collision detection is based on the entire rectangular sprite,
which in the case of the big X has quite a different shape.)
Use the arrow keys to accelerate the spaceship in any
direction.
  
Press the Space key to toggle the spaceship's behavior when
it collides with an edge or the big X: it can bounce or stop.
  
The spaceship's "eyes" turn red briefly when it bumps against
the big X or the side of the window.  The red "eyes"
(see  images/et-red-eyes.png) 
are pinned onto the spaceship sprite, and are normally
hidden (because of spaceshipBumped.hide()).  When a collision
is detected, spaceshipBumped.show() is called, so they
appear on top of the usual green "eyes."
At timer named "TurnOffBumpedIndicator" is created, which
causes TurnOffBumpedIndicatorTimer() to be invoked every 200
milliseconds.  But since that method turns itself off, it
is only called once, and the eyes are set back to green by
hiding the pinned sprite.
