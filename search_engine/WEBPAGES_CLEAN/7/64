                                  Last Monday on November 2nd, our first meeting of November, WICS and non-profit organization, Girls Inc., hosted an info session to talk about what Girls Inc. does. The evening started with a presentation about its values and opportunities for students. Then we concluded with a quick Q&amp;A session with the representatives. WICS would like to thank Jessica and Mark for coming and introducing Girls Inc. to our members. We would also like to thank all the students who came and are interested in volunteering at Girls Inc.
