 My brain was blown when I've first seen this awesome piece of game. Freshest tablet game from a top of the line game studio, showing such awesome and majestic enemies that I'm still stunned and appaled. Seeing myriads of zombie bugs dead, trigger constantly fluttering as I was releasing a barrage of bullets from my shadowgun and throwing explosives everywhere. Ominous main character reminded me of the old Doom PC game, though Combat Trigger: Modern Dead 3D has several more gameplay features. Our health gets to be customized which is the only thing that lets us persist even deeper into this sci-fi horror. Modern warfare gets blended with gloomy and depressed futurism, where cosmos exploration gave us only ineffable dismay of having Earth infested by dead zombie invaders. Billions of them, in fact. All hungry for our lives and our goods! Cool ego shooter, hard waffen, wow. 
Become a frontline commando with your rifle blazing, or snipe the zombie beasts from huge distances. All using only your tablet screen. Only the best exploits of modern warfare combined with an quick trigger finger will let you to achieve victory over the monstrous bugs. Awesome graphics encourage you to heed your call of duty. Combat in modern style your fear when travelling through future Earth locations and shooting your shadowgun, become the extreme mobile frontline commando, killing numerous like an android.

 I have recently come across a new driving app for android, its name is Real Race: Asphalt Road Racing and it looks almost like a simulator with arcade mechanics. 
On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a strong 8. List of features is nearly overwhelming, so is its playability. Outrunning the leaderboards really entangles you and you're instantaneously pulled in. It trully reminds me of Asphalt Overdrive. Overall it's a good, ambitious free game. 
There are no chases with law enforcement, but maybe it is for the best as multiplayer asphalt gameplay gives awesome occasion to prove your unparalleled underground drag racing prowess. 
It boasts some very state-of-the-art AI and I've played already 6 times successively or so and it is still appealing and interesting. 
Racing around deserts and grasslands, asphalt and roads, it's like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and actually the newest part, NFS: Rivals. 
On-screen immense velocity gives a feel of literally being there and racing with top drivers as seen in TV. Stress spikes are numerous. 
It is kinda kewl to drive and vanquish other racers on 6 or so maps. Game feels similar to race with GT cars like lamborghini or dodge viper.

 modern combat  —   13 February 2015, 05:54    
   
 My mind was blown when I've saw for the first time this sweet piece of game. Newest phone game from a top of the line game studio, displaying such awesome and horrible enemies that I'm still shocked and consternated. Witnessing numberless undead bugs dead, trigger steadily kicking as I was firing my shadowgun and tossing grenades everywhere. Ominous main character reminded me of the old Doom PC game, though Combat Trigger: Modern Dead 3D has several more gameplay features. Our defenses gets to be personalized which is the only thing that lets us continue even deeper into this science fiction nightmare. Modern warfare gets blended with murky and pessimistic sci-fi, where deep space exploration gave us only ineffable horror of having Terra occupied by dead zombie bugs. Humongous numbers of them, actually. All hungry for our blood and our homes! Cool ego shooter, hard waffen, wow. 
Become a frontline commando with your pistol blazing, or snipe the zombie monsters from huge areas. All using only your touch screen. Only the best stunts of modern warfare combined with an quick trigger finger will let you to win over the dead bugs. Great graphics encourage you to heed your call of duty. Combat in modern style your anxiety when travelling through future human cities and throwing barrages of bullets from your shadowgun, become the ultimate mobile frontline commando, murdering millions like an android.

 Cheap Air Jordans  —   19 December 2014, 07:38    
   
 Air Jordan is a brand of shoes and athletic clothing designed, owned, and produced for Michael Jordan by Nike's Jordan Brand subsidiary. The shoes informally referred to in the plural as Jordan's or simply J's, were first produced for Michael Jordan in 1984 and released for public consumption in 2001.|Since its introduction into the sports shoe market, the Air Jordan evolved to the original basketball shoes to models for different uses, including I-XXIII.. Air Jordan currently sponsors 21 active NBA players, including Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Ray Allen, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony. They also endorse Nike Air Jordan products. Also they sponsor other sports such as the MLB, NFL, NASCAR, Track, and the WNBA.|The Air Jordan 1 was designed by Peter Moore. The Air Jordan 1 was first produced for Michael Jordan in 1983, in a red and black colorway to match the uniform of the Chicago Bulls, the team for which Michael Jordan played. This red and black color-way was later outlawed by NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them. Michael Jordan would wear the shoes anyway, and each time he stepped on the court with the Air Jordan 1 he would be fined five thousand dollars. Nike used this as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities. Nike would later create a colorway with red, white, and black which would be worn by Jordan for most of the 1985 and 1986 season.|The success of the Air Jordan 1 encouraged Nike to release the New Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy giving the shoe a luxury feel. The Air Jordan II was originally retailed at $100.|The Air Jordan III was designed by Tinker Hatfield who works by nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the Jordan III changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new Jumpman logo, an elephant print trim and tumble leather to give it a luxury look. The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the character he played in his film 'She's Gotta Have It'. This campaign was known as the "Mars and Mike" ad campaign, which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordan's to feature the "NIKE AIR" logo on the back, but later replaced by the Jumpman logo, with the words "AIR" underneath it, similar to the Air Jordan VI. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the 1988 Dunk Championship and many other event

 I have recently come across a new asphalt app for android, it's called Real Race: Asphalt Road Racing and it looks nearly like a simulator with arcade mechanics. 
On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a strong 8. List of features is almost mind-boggling, so is its replayability. Besting the leaderboards trully caughts you and you are directly drawn in. It really reminds me of Asphalt Overdrive. Overall it's a good, ambitious free game. 
There are no chases with law enforcement, but I suppose it is good though as multiplayer asphalt feature gives awesome occasion to verify your unparalleled underground drag racing prowess. 
It boasts  very cutting-edge AI and I've played already ten times in a row or so and it's still amusing and interesting. 
Driving through deserts and grasslands, asphalt and highways, it's like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and as a matter of fact the latest part, NFS: Rivals. 
On-screen high speed gives a feel of actually being there and hurrying with top drivers as seen in TV. Adrenaline rushes are numerous. 
It's kinda cool to race and defeat other racers on six or so maps. Game is similar to race with GT cars like lamborghini or asphalt.

On-screen high velocity gives an illusion of actually being there and racing with top drivers as seen in TV. Stress spikes are not far and few. 
It boasts some really state-of-the-art AI and I'm playing it already seven times successively or so and it is still appealing and engaging. It's kinda kewl to drive and beat other players on 6 or so maps. Game feels like race with GT cars like lamborghini or dodge viper.

 mobile racing game  —   02 October 2014, 05:27    
   
 I have just stumbled upon a fresh driving game for smartphones, it's called Real Race: Asphalt Road Racing and it's nearly like a racing sim with arcade mechanics. 
On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a strong 8. List of features is almost overwhelming, so is its replayability. Outrunning the leaderboards really caughts you and you are right away drawn in. It really reminds me of Asphalt Overdrive. Overall it is a great, ambitious free game. 
There are no chases with the police, but maybe it's for the best as multiplayer asphalt feature gives great occasion to verify your cool underground drag racing skills. 
It boasts  really cutting-edge AI and I've played already seven times successively or so and it's still amusing and engaging. 
Racing through dunes and steppes, asphalt and roads, it is like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and as a matter of fact the newest part, NFS: Rivals. 
On-screen immense velocity gives a feel of actually being there and hurrying with top drivers as seen in TV. Stress spikes are not far and few. 
It's kinda cool to race and defeat other players on six or so maps. App is like race with GT cars like lamborghini or dodge viper.

There are no chases with law enforcement, but I suppose it's for the best as multiplayer asphalt gameplay gives great occasion to show your cool underground drag racing prowess.

Racing around deserts and grasslands, avenues and roads, it's like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and actually the latest edition, NFS: Rivals. 
On-screen high velocity gives an illusion of actually being there and racing with top drivers as seen in TV. Adrenaline spikes are numerous. 
It is kinda kewl to race and vanquish other racers on 6 or so tracks. App feels similar to race with GT cars like lamborghini or asphalt.

 asphalt overdrive  —   08 July 2014, 11:45    
   
 I've just stumbled upon a fresh racing game for android, it's called Real Race: Asphalt Road Racing and it looks really like a simulator with casual feel. 
It has some really cutting-edge AI and I'm playing it already seven times in a row or so and it is still appealing and engaging. It is kinda cool to race and defeat other players on six or so maps. App is similar to race with GT cars like race or dodge viper. Racing around dunes and steppes, avenues and highways, it is like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and actually the latest edition, NFS: Rivals Underground. There are no pursuits with law enforcement, but maybe it's good though as multiplayer asphalt feature grants great occasion to demonstrate your unsurpassed underground drag racing skills. 
On-screen great speed gives a feel of actually being there and hurrying with top drivers as seen on television. Adrenaline rushes are not far and few. 
 
 On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a strong 8. List of features is nearly mind-boggling, so is its playability. Outrunning the leaderboards trully caughts you and you're right away drawn in. It trully reminded me of Asphalt Overdrive. Overall it's a awesome, ambitious free app.

 Real Racing  —   23 June 2014, 04:57    
   
 I've just stumbled upon a new racing app for android phones, it's called Real Race: Asphalt Road Racing and it seems to be almost like a simulator with arcade feel. 
It boasts some very advanced AI and I'm playing it already 8 times in a row or so and it's still appealing and interesting. It's somehow cool to drive and defeat other racers on six or so tracks. Game is like grand prix with GT cars like ferrari or porsche. Racing through deserts and grasslands, asphalt and lanes, it's like Need for Speed Carbon or Most Wanted, and actually the newest part, NFS: Rivals. There are no chases with the police, but perhaps it is for the best as multiplayer gameplay grants great opportunity to show your cool underground drag racing prowess. 
On-screen immense velocity forces a feel of actually being there and racing with the best drivers as seen on television. Adrenaline rushes are numerous. 
 
 On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a strong eight. List of features is nearly mind-boggling, so is its replayability. Beating the leaderboards trully entangles you and you're instantly pulled in. It really reminds me of Fast and Furious. Overall it is a great, ambitious free app.

 Join a QuotesChimp. The old saying that there is power in numbers is especially pertinent in the area of insurance. Thus, whenever possible, obtain your insurance through a group rather than on an individual basis. Not only will you save money but you will have the power of the group to keep you from being penalized (by increased premiums or refusal to renew) if you make what the company thinks are excessive claims.

 Even if the content in your articles is based around the same topic, keep each title or heading interesting, you should make the names and titles unique and interesting. The first couple words in your title are what makes a reader interested. 
 
 If you don't keep track of your standings then you will not know if your seo efforts are paying off. You can use either Alexa or Google toolbar to determine your ranking. 
 
 Using product feeds can really help to reach new customers. Feeds can contain information about your business such as prices, descriptions and prices.Submit them to sites for shoppers as well as to search engines. 
 
 There are many different techniques you can optimize your search engine rankings. You will get the most results if your system for search. The optimized performance will result in an overall better experience for the user. 
 
 Content is the most important aspect of SEO strategy. Your content needs to be the right length, but also focus on a main subject. You should also need to use better grammar than the competition. When you content is well written, it helps to have great content on your site. 
 
 This is very useful for the people who found you through YouTube. 
 
 Add a site directory if you're trying to get more visitors. A site map is a great tool to help people locate pages within your web pages together. 
 
 Focus on becoming an expert in just one or two aspects of SEO techniques at a time. There is not enough time to excel in all the various SEO techniques, so select one which you think will be the most valuable to you and make the most of its capabilities. 
 
 Purchasing a previously used domain name that has some history behind it will automatically get you a higher ranking. Search engines give higher value on domain names that have been around for more than two years old. 
 
 Coding is an important aspect to consider when you want to bring people to your website. For example, a site that relies heavily upon JavaScript must be coded efficiently, search engine spiders cannot index it. 
 
 Many believe that simply including keywords in comment tags will create a more visible site. 
 
 Using keywords in your structure and content will increase your site an advantage on most search engines. 
 
 There are multiple thing you get from search engine. You will find you get the most results if you are maximizing search efficiency. The optimized performance will result in an overall better experience for the user. 
 
 Your website's server needs to be configured so that it is case-sensitive with regards to URLs. 
 
 If you're using a server that's shared, ensure that no banned sites are on your proxy. If you unknowingly share a proxy with spammers and/or banned sites, it will have a negative impact on your search engine ratings, or in some cases not indexed at all. 
 
 Use the longer forms of words for keywords to generate more search engine hits. Keyword stemming is used by some of the search engines use. If you use "accountant" as your keyword," for instance," but others may not. If you are using a search engine that uses keyword stemming, then your site will be included in the searches that include the shorter form of the word as well. 
 
 Optimize your entire site toward your targeted niche and target niche. Always add relevant content that contains keywords; this includes your main keywords. 
 
 Search engine optimization requires patience and you might be slow to see results. It is a natural response to want to see results right away for your work. You have to remember that creating a solid web presence online takes dedication and time. 
 
 If you feature a good number of videos on your site, realize that crawlers will have trouble finding these, no matter how high it is in quality. To help website crawlers recognize your website's videos, create a site map listing videos you posted on your site to allow web crawlers can see them. 
 
 Make sure every piece of text and every image on your site is geared toward your primary keywords and your niche. Always add relevant content that contains keywords; this includes your main keywords. 
 
 Your page rank gets higher the longer time a person remains on how long a person is on your site. 
 
 Try writing a list of useful tips when shopping for something in your product category, or an article about its use or how others have benefited from it. 
 
 Spiders are constantly crawling through your content and pulling your site up based on things like keywords, so it is important that they can understand your site. A sitemap allows you to present the spider can use to understand your site; this also makes it easier for spiders to assess relevancy. 
 
 Games and surveys are good ways to find your site to better assist you in finding the ideal target audience.People love to take surveys to see what type of person they are. You should inquire about their shopping habits or interests. You'll learn more about your audience this way and people will enjoy doing the surveys. 
 
 You get free publicity that will help bring visitors with this service. Always take advantage of free venues for your publicity. 
 
 Doing search engine optimization to help draw traffic to your website is actually something that can be done with minimal muss and fuss. It simply requires being detail oriented, and a willingness to adopt the right strategies. Keep these tips handy, and use them as a reference to help you improve your website's search engine ranking.

 It would be useful if you could put up our marks till date on MyEEE. We could get an estimate of where we stand

 Awaiting solutions to the last HW :)

 If we want to submit HW4 electronically, should we use the "Hwk2" AssignmentSubmission dropbox on EEE or will a new one be created?  Or should HW4 only be turned in during class?  Thank you.
  Sorry; I've created a HW4 drop box if you need it.  However, if you could also turn in a hard-copy in class (of anything except code) I'd appreciate it.

 Hi Ben,
You can refer to last quarter's slides while waiting for slides for this class.
I mean CS271 in fall 2008 offered by prof. Dechter.
Actually, the contents are almost identical.
  Yes, my slides are based on slides from previous versions of 271, and those slides can be used if you don't want to wait for mine.

 Wonder how long it'll take to get lecture slides posted.  Bad bad bad
  I don't see that waiting one day to get slides is such a big deal.  How many people have started the homework?

 I am sorry; my previous post mean: the textbook defines Quiescence as what the slides define (as the Horizon effect)*!

 It seems like the textbook defines Quiescence as what the slides have defined (Pg 202 in the Second edition of the textbook). And I don't quite get what the textbook defines as the horizon effect if it is any different at all. Is my understanding correct?
   Good question.  Quiescence is a measure of how strong the horizon effect will be -- quiescent nodes will not suffer from a strong (short term) horizon effect.  So the horizon effect is the notion that there is a distance beyond which the algorithm cannot "see", and quiescence is a property of a node that if we look only a little further our evaluation function will not change dramatically.

 Does the min-conflicts algorithm always terminate?  I remember how hill-climbing greedily picked a next solution and could get stuck in a local maximum.  It seems that min-conflicts could infinitely loop, trying and moving variables without reaching a solution.  Or are there bounds to the number of attempts?
   Not always -- it can become stuck, and terminate at a non-solution, or can move randomly around a plateau.  But it is effective with surprising frequency.

 I think we all need the solution to homework 2 before the midterm. Could you upload the solution?
   Done.

 For Problem 2 on Homework 2, what did you mean by "for compactness, write each node as (abc;def;ghi)"?  Did you mean draw a search tree and nodes in the tree should appear as letters rather than explicit 3x3 states of the 8-puzzle?
   I simply meant that, rather than drawing an entire 8-puzzle square, you can just write each configuration "in order", say left-to-right and top-to-bottom.  If you want to draw the entire square that's OK too.

 It would be helpful if you can put up the midterm course online 
Thanks
   I'm not quite sure what this means.

 At least, could you upload lecture slides within the day we have a class?
I would like to go over the materials while I can still remember them clearly.

 probably you can release a version before class much before and if there are major changes then a second revised version.

 yeah yeah yeah~ I agree.. eh.. I mean, I have the same Q as Kim( 13 Jan.)
Thanks^^

 Can we have powerpoints available before class so we can print them out from home?
   Hmm.  Fair question. I can try, but I'm not always done editing them.  I'll see if I can get into the habit.

 Will class powerpoint be available for download?
   Yes; they're now posted on the syllabus.
