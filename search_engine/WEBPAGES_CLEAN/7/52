  Operating System Usage  
      Basic User/Supervisor Mode Distinction
 
  Supervisor mode allows modification of protection data structures
  Special instructions used to modify these data structures check for privilege mode, trap otherwise
  Bootstrap to privilege mode, initial execution loophole must correctly setup these data structures
  
  =&gt; Most of the isolation is ensured indirectly through implicit instruction execution constraints
  Address checking in the translation lookaside buffer
  Mode checking based on instruction type
  Simple mechanisms in hardware, all conventions in software
