  Online Validation: Motivation  
      Classical system design depends on off-line testing/validation of hardware designs
 
  Huge cost/ effort for complex designs, many errors get through
  CAD tools / Compilers often generate erroneous code (see errata lists!)
  Correct by construction doesnï¿½t work (at least not yet!).
       Adaptive systems inherently involve
 
  Unpredictable interactions (new hardware and software)
  Cross process interactions?
  Dynamic adaptation?
       Would you fly on an airplane with an adaptive computer in the landing system?
