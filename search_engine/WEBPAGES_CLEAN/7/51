  Network Effects  
      XML, WebDAV, and ISEN each generate network effects for each other
 
  WebDAV increases the value of XML by linking it to resources
  XML increases the value of WebDAV by providing an extensible marshalling syntax
  ISEN services increase the value of WebDAV by adding awareness information
