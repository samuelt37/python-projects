    Â    
 
 Do your best to improve each of the following short
passages.  Try to remain true to the author's meaning and intentions;
feel free to consult with others in the cases where the author's meaning
is ambiguous or opaque.  Don't be shy about rewording or rearranging
significantly.  
 
 Many of these passages depend on the proper placement
of modifying words or phrases; this concept is analogous to the computer
science concepts of identifier scope and operator precedence.
