    				Entrepreneurship    			 
  			 
    			  “Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” –Mark Twain  
 One of the greatest enjoyment is to apply research to develop products that impact our lives. This has driven Ramesh to address issues in technology that will make a difference in the next few years. This is one of the most enjoyable aspect of being a researcher engineer.
