3.26.5 SetFormat 
 

 
    
bool SetFormat(unsigned int fmt)
    
Set the file format associated with an output oemolstream.  The set of
unsigned integer values valid for this property are defined by the
OEFormat namespace.  By default, when writing to standard out
(std::cout), the associated file format is OEFormat::SMILES.  The
file format property of an output oemolstream may be retrieved using the
oemolostream::GetFormat method.  Note that the file format property is
also set automatically by oemolostream::open based upon the file
extension of the specified filename.
