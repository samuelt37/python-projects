 Dr. Rohit Khare: Resume (2004)<body> DR. ROHIT KHARE  OBJECTIVE   To study, design, and implement   distributed    decentralized systems that will change the world.   (Unlike traditional client/serversolutions, decentralized systems must permit participants to disagreeor disconnect safely.)   EXPERIENCE                2004-present                CommerceNet Labs 	   	   Mountain View, CA	               Director of a new electronic-commerce research laboratory.                       CommerceNet is a ten-year-old nonprofit organizations dedicating to	   advancing commerce on the Internet. From its earliest days working on Web security and credit-cardpayment prototcols to its success spinning out XML technologies, CommerceNet has been a unique neutral meeting place for users, vendors, and entrepreneurs. In the latter capacity, CommerceNet also spins out startup companies. One of those became CommerceOne, which funded the endowment CommerceNet is investing in Labs today.            
	  As Director, I am working with our Board to recruit an R&amp;D team focused on the new challenges of decentralized commerce; as well as supporting our interests in engineering entrepreneurship and investment activity. As of the launch of zLab in December 2004, we have hired half a dozen Fellows, Members of Technical Staff, and Associates; and produced as many technical reports for our website,  http://zLab.Commerce.Net/ .                        1999-2002                KnowNow 	   	   Sunnyvale, CA	               Co-founder, CEO, and CTO of a successful venture-backed startup.                        The KnowNow LiveServer is a simple and flexible way to    distribute real-time information across the Internet. Its core    innovation is a way to use the Web in a peer-to-peer mode that    enables developers to publish and subscribe to events across Web    browsers, Excel spreadsheets, and custom applications written in a    half-dozen different programming languages.                       At KnowNow, I raised $22.5M in venture capital, led by    Kleiner, Perkins and several other angels and professional    investors over three rounds. I managed the research and    development team of several full-time employees and dozens of    contractors that produced the original release, which led to the    open-source Mod_PubSub project as well as a pending patent. I also    recruited a complete management team in order to focus on my role    as CTO to represent customers' interests to Engineering and    Marketing. Later, I took a sabbatical to complete my PhD after my    original leave-of-absence from UC Irvine expired.                        1997                MCI Communications 	   	   Boston, MA	               Internet Architect, working with the standards policy and    security teams.                        MCI's Internet Architecture Group, headed up by Vint Cerf,    provided the technical leadership behind the world's largest IP    carrier. We participated in the standards-setting and    interoperability-testing processes, particularly around security    and internationalization.                        With John Klensin, I designed a patent-pending    content-filtering service for helping families select appropriate    policy providers and supervising Web access for each child.                                  1996-present                4K Associates 	   	   Irvine, CA	               Founder and president of an Internet standards strategy consultancy.                        Provided market research, standards analysis, and training    in technologies ranging from Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)    to Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) for clients such    as Bain &amp; Co., Canon, Sun Microsystems, the US Department of    Justice, Nextel, Jabber, and Microsoft.              	  At 4K Associates, I managed a team of ten principals over    the years, bridging the worlds of academia and industry. I also wrote    the industry's first public report criticizing WAP as needlessly    incompatible with Web standards -- now seen as conventional wisdom    -- as part of due diligence on Microsoft's $600M investment in Nextel.                                  1995-97                World Wide Web Consortium (MIT) 	   	   Cambridge, MA	               Technical lead for Security, Electronic Commerce, and        HTTP Extension activities.                       The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), headed up by Tim Berners-Lee,    brings together the world's leading research organizations,    technology vendors, and user organizations to lead the continuing    evolution of open standards for the Web. As one of the very first    employees beyond the original team that invented the Web at CERN,    we pioneered the processes and organizational structure that still    guide W3C today.                        Analysis, protocol development, and implementation support    for the Technology &amp; Society and Web Architecture Domains. I    wrote and edited technical specifications, position papers, and    the W3C Newsletter.I also organized and spoke at dozens of W3C,    IETF, IW3C2, and DARPA meetings and invited workshops.                                  1995-97                O'Reilly &amp; Associates 	   	   Sebastopol, CA	               Editor-in-Chief of the  World Wide Web Journal .                       Along the lines of its  Perl Journal  and  The    X Resource , O'Reilly &amp; Associates joined with W3C and    International WWW Conference Committee (IW3C2) to publish the    quarterly  W3J .                        I solicited, edited, and contributed to seven books in the    series, totaling 1,500pp. Together with other ORA editors and key    conferences and workshops, we brought subscribers the latest    standards, research, and previews of upcoming books on Web technology.                                  1993-1995                Rohit Khare Software 	   	   Pasadena, CA	               Development of custom &amp; commercial NeXTstep applications.                       Designed, implemented, and tested novel email connectivity    protocols and secure encryption of multimedia email for clients    such as the LA Sheriff's Department, BOSS Logic, and SHL    Systemhouse.                                  1992-present                Journalist &amp; Author 	   	   Various                       Correspondent, product reviewer, and columnist for the    software industry.	               Reported for several IDG publications, including     NeXTworld Magazine .
