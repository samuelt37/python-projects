				 Abstract 
				 


				 

 
 Motivation . We present the software architecture of the Computable Plant Project, a
multidisciplinary computationally based approach to the study of plant development.
Arabidopsis thaliana is used as a model organism, and shoot apical meristem
development as a model process. Meristems are the plant tissues where regulated cell
division and differentiation lead to plant parts such as flowers and leaves. We are using
green fluorescent proteins to mark specific cell types and acquire time series of threedimensional
images via laser scanning confocal microscopy. To support this we have
developed an interoperable architecture for experiment design that involves automated
code generation, computational modeling, and image analysis. 
 
 Results . Automated image analysis, model fitting, and code generation allow us to
explore alternative hypothesis in silico and guide in vivo experimental design. These
predictions are tested using standard techniques such as mutants and altered hormone
gradients. The present paper focuses on the automated code generation architecture.
