 * 4nbg - solve alternate formulation of 4/n problem.
 * David Eppstein, UC Irvine, 26 Oct 1998
 *
 * 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z can be solved if we can find b and g s.t.
 * b+g = 0 mod (-n mod 4bg): From any solution b, g,
 * let a = (b+g)/(-n mod 4bg), f = (an+b)/g, c = (f+1)/4ab.
 * Then 4/n = 1/abcn + 1/bcg + 1/acgn.
 *
 * Not all solutions to 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z look like this,
 * even when n is prime, but this seems to work for many n.
 *
 * There never exist solutions b and g when n is square (apparently this
 * is related to a 1956 paper by A. Schinzel cited in the section of
 * Unsolved Problems in Number Theory on the 4/n problem).  But they
 * also do not exist for certain other special values of n: 288, 336,
 * and 4545 (and no others less than a million).  What are these numbers?
