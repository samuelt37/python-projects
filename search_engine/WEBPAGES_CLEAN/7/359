    Dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees and extrema of binary functions . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-05 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Tech. Rep. 92-88 , ICS, UCI, 1992.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  13: 111–122, 1995 .
 
Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
 minimum spanning tree  can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt  n ) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

Number theory.
I survey and implement in  Mathematica  several methods
for representing rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions.
One of the methods involves searching for paths in a certain graph
using a   k  shortest paths  heuristic.

    A deterministic linear time algorithm for geometric separators
and its applications .

G.L. Miller , and 
 
S.-H. Teng .   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 99–108 .   Fundamenta Informaticae  22: 309–330, 1995 
(special issue on computational geometry).
 
Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Any  d -dimensional point set
can be triangulated
with O( n  ceil( d /2) ) simplices, none of which has
an obtuse
dihedral angle.
No bound depending only on  n  is possible 
if we require the maximum dihedral angle to measure at most 
90-epsilon degrees or the minimum dihedral to measure
at least epsilon.  Includes a
 
classification of simplices  in terms of their bad angles.

    Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 94-25 , ICS, UCI, 1994.  
 6th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
San Francisco, 1995, pp. 632–640 .  arXiv:cs.DS/9911003 .   J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications  3 (3): 1–27, 1999. 
 
Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, " Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families ", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

    Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-11 , ICS, UCI, 1995.   27th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing,  Las Vegas, 1995, pp. 662–671 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  20: 463–476, 1998 .
 
Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.

Given a set of points with weights that are not known precisely,
but are known to fall within some range, considers the possible
weighted centroids arising from different choices of weights
in each range.  The combinatorics of this problem are closely
connected with those of
 zonotopes .

    3-Coloring in time O(1.3446  n  ): a no-MIS algorithm .  R. Beigel 
and D. Eppstein.

Worksh. Faster Exact Solutions for NP-Hard Problems , 2000.
 
Speeds up 3-coloring by solving a harder problem:
constraint satisfaction in which each variable can take on
one of three values and each constraint forbids a pair of
variable assignments.  The detailed solution involves
several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,
3-edge-coloring, and 3-SAT.  The 3-SAT algorithm is fixed-parameter tractible in that it is polynomial time when the number of 3-variable clauses is O(log n).
Merged into
 3-coloring in time O(1.3289^n) 
for the journal version.

Uses geometric optimization techniques to find, among  n  weighted values,
the  k  to drop so as to maximize the weighted average of the remaining values.
The feasibility test for the corresponding decision problem involves
 k -sets in a dual line arrangement.

    Faster geometric  k -point MST approximation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-13 , ICS, UCI, 1995.  Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  8: 231–240, 1997.
 
Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select  k  points that can be connected by a
small
 spanning tree .  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable  k );
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on  n  is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in
quadtrees, and a general technique
based on that in " Iterated nearest neighbors "
for reducing the dependence
on  n  in any approximation algorithm.

    Representing all minimum spanning trees with applications to
counting and generation . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-50 , ICS, UCI, 1995.
 
Shows how to find for any edge weighted graph G an equivalent
graph EG such that the  minimum spanning trees 
of G correspond one-for-one with the spanning trees of EG.
The equivalent graph can be
constructed in time O(m+n log n) given a single minimum spanning tree of
G.  As a consequence one can find fast algorithms for counting, listing,
and randomly generating MSTs.
Also discusses similar
equivalent graph constructions for
 shortest paths , minimum cost flows,
and  bipartite matching .
