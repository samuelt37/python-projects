 UCI ML Repository: Donations Info<body>
  Making donations to the UCI Machine Learning Repository 

We're always looking for additional databases.  Donations 
may be made by doing an 
 
anonymous ftp  of donated files to the  /incoming  directory 
at  ftp.ics.uci.edu .  After ftping your files, please send email 
to  ml-repository@ics.uci.edu . 

While we accept entries with minimal documentation.  We prefer that
the donor do their best at documenting the files.  The file 
 DOC-REQUIREMENTS 
describes the standard documentation format.  

We also prefer that the data have a standard format.  For databases of
instances: one instance per line, no spaces, commas separate attribute
values, and missing values denoted by "?" is the standard form.  For
other types of data, use your best judgment.

  Thanks for you donations! You are helping to make machine
learning a strong and vital research area.
