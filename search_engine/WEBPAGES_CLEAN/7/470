See LRM section 9.5.1

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
   Each condition is aboolean expression:
 architecture COND of BRANCH is
begin
   Z  5 else
        B when X   
   
  

 
   Conditions may overlap, as for the  if 
statement. The expression corresponding to the first "true" condition is
assigned.
 architecture COND of BRANCH is
begin
   Z   
   
  

 
   There must be a final unconditional  else  expression:
 architecture COND of WRONG is
begin
   Z  5;  --illegal
end COND;  
   
  

 
   The expressions assigned may be delayed.
 Transport delay  mode may
also be specified 
   
  

 
   Conditional signal assigments may be used to define  tri-state
buffers , using the  std_logic  and  std_logic_vector 
type. Note the use of the  aggregate  form for
a vector bus. 
architecture COND of TRI_STATE is
  signal TRI_BIT: std_logic;
  signal TRI_BUS: 
             std_logic_vector(0 to 7);
begin
  TRI_BIT  'Z');
end COND;  
   
  

 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

Conditional signal assignments are generally synthesisable.
 
A conditional signal assignment will usually result in combinational
logic being generated. Assignment to 'Z' will normally generate
tri-state drivers. Assinment to 'X' may not be supported.
  
If a signal is conditionally assigned to itself, latches may be
inferred.

  
        Whats New in '93       

In  VHDL -93, any signal assigment statement may have an optinal label.
  
 VHDL -93 defines an  unaffected  keyword, which indicates a
condition when a signal is not given a new assignment:
  label: signal 
The keywords  inertial and reject  may also be
used in a conditional signal assignment.
 
A conditional signal assignment can be specified to run as a
 postponed  process.
