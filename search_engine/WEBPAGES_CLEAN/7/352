A Sidetrack-based Approach for the k Shortest Simple Path Problem
  
Denis Kurz
  
We propose an algorithm for the problem of finding the k shortest simple 
s-t paths in a directed, weighted graph. Unlike other algorithms for this 
problem, it does not solve the replacement path problem repeatedly. Instead, 
we exploit the notion of sidetracks of a shortest path trees. Sidetracks were 
first used by Eppstein to solve a similar problem where the output paths are 
not required to be simple.
   

Our algorithm maintains the worst case running time of state-of-the-art 
algorithms for this problem. In practice, the sidetrack-based approach is 
highly competitive on all graph classes that we used in computational studies 
compared to other approaches, and faster by up to two orders of magnitude on 
some of the classes.
