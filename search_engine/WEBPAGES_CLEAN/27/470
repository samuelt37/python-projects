bool SetFragmentNumber(int frag)
    
Set the fragment number property of a residue.  Fragment numbers are
integer indices that define the connected components of a
macromolecule.  When reading from a PDB file, the first atom is placed
in fragment number 1.  Each time a ``TER'', ``END'' or ``ENDM'' record is
encountered within a single connection table, the fragment number is
incremented.  Similarly, when writing a PDB file, a TER record is
written between any consecutive pair of atoms with different fragment
numbers.  The default value is zero.  The fragment number property of
a residue may be retrieved using the OEResidue::GetFragmentNumber
method.
