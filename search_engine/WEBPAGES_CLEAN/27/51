 Abstract  
Reasoning in Bayesian networks is exponential in a graph parameter w* known
as induced width (also known as tree-width and max-clique size). In this paper, we
investigate the potential of causal independence (CI) for improving this performance.
We consider several tasks, such as belief updating, finding a most probable 
explanation (MPE), finding a maximum aposteriori hypothesis (MAP), and finding the
maximum expected utility (MEU). We show that exploiting CI in belief updating can significantly reduce the 
effective w*, sometimes down to the induced width of the unmoralized network's graph.
For example, for poly-trees, CI reduces complexity from exponential to linear in the
family size. Similar results hold for the MAP and MEU tasks, while the MPE task
is less sensitive to CI. These enhancements are incorporated into bucket-elimination
algorithms based on known approaches of network transformations [10, 13] and
elimination [18]. We provide an ordering heuristic which guarantees that exploiting CI
will never hurt the performance. Finally, we discuss an efficient way of propagating evidence in CI-networks using 
arc-consistency, and apply this idea to noisy-OR networks. The resulting algorithm 
generalizes the Quickscore algorithm [9] for BN2O networks.
