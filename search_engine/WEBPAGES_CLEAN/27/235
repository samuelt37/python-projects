   Data Set Information:  
 The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.   The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.   A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link:  [Web Link]   An updated version of this dataset can be found at  [Web Link] . It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows.  

   Attribute Information:  
 For each record in the dataset it is provided: - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  - Its activity label.  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
