        Future work 

    	    Coming soon 
	    	 
	    		The current version of DataGuard comes with three translational layer.
	    	 
	    	 
	    	   DB2 
	    		 Gmail 
	    		 Amazon S3 
	    	 


	    		We are still working to improve the system and add new functionalities.
	    		We are close to releasing the code for other translational layers. Those are:


	    	  Flickr - Privacy preserving storing and sharing of images. 
		    	 Google Calendar - Privacy preserving calendar. 
		    	 Google DocsSpreadsheets - Privacy preserving documents sharing. 
	    	  

    	    Open problems 

    			In DataGuard, we only considered the problem of accessing data remotely. When it
    			comes to personal information another requirement is the ability to share it.
    			DataGuard middleware could be extended to allow data sharing as well. This raises
    			many interesting challenges, since to enable data sharing the untrusted server should
    			authenticate users and distribute data. This needs to be done in a fashion where the
    			server does not learn any user's data.
