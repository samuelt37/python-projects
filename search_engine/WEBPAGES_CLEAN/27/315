20.1 Obtaining the Atomic Symbol of an Atom/Element 
 

 
To simplify the task of dealing with the elements of the periodic
table, OEChem contains several functions to obtain useful properties
of the elements.

  
A common task is to obtain or display the atomic symbol of an atom
represented by an OEAtomBase.  To save space and reduce redundancy and
consistency issues the OEAtomBase class contains only an unsigned
integer representing the atom's atomic number.  This value may be
obtained using the OEAtomBase method  GetAtomicNum .  This value can
be converted into an atomic symbol using the OEChem function,
 OEGetAtomicSymbol .

  
    #include "oechem.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   const char *symb = OEGetAtomicSymbol(OEElemNo::C);
   cout &lt;&lt; "The atomic symbol for carbon is " &lt;&lt; symb &lt;&lt; endl;
}

The example above uses the unsigned integer constant  OEElemNo::C 
from the  OEElemNo  namespace.  This namespace represents the atomic
numbers of the 109 elements as their symbols as a convenience.

  
The  OEGetAtomicSymbol  function always returns a valid
 const char *  pointer.  For atomic number zero and elements greater
than or equal to  OEElemNo::MAXELEM  (currently 110),
 OEGetAtomicSymbol  returns a pointer to the NUL character,
 '\0' ,  i.e.  an empty string.  For all other (valid) values, the
returned string contains one or two characters.
The first character is always uppercase, and the second character, if
it exists is lower case.
