						 Dr. Cory Knobel, executive director of the EVOKE Lab &amp; Studio, received the Lee Dirks Memorial Award for best paper at the 2014 iConference, held in Berlin, Germany on March 4-7, along with co-authors Dr. Leanne Bowler and Eleanor Mattern of the University of Pittsburgh iSchool. The paper,   Developing Design Interventions for Cyberbullying: A Narrative-Based Participatory Approach   reports on a set of collaborative sessions with youth to derive modes of social media design that are empirically grounded in children’s experiences with online bullying.
