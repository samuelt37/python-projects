| But wait ... the relative URL in A.html will try to get the 2.1 version of
| logo.gif, which doesn't exist!  Assuming you mean that the version=2.1
| really refers to a collection of resources, I'll assume you can add a
| symbolic link to version 2.0 of logo.gif into the version=2.1 collection.
| At this point, let me introduce resource C.html, which, like A.html, has
| three versions, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1.  As you might imagine, C.html also
| includes logo.gif, but C.html is an older page which has not been updated
| recently, and hence includes logo.gif version 1.0. So the URL for C.html
| is:
|
|  http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html 
|
| Utilizing the solution of adding a symbolic link to logo.gif, version 1.0
| into collection "version=2.1", we suddenly realize that a symbolic link to
| logo.gif already exists (left over from adding the link to version 2.0 of
| logo.gif for A.html version 2.1).  This is a problem.

Your examples are confusing versions (generically) and revision numbers.
Revisions are usually file-specific.  That is, each file has its own
independent revision space.  Versions are more generic, and include
symbolic labels (the example I used) which occupy a separate namespace
from revisions.  Thus

	 http://foo.bar.com/version=best/A.html 
	 http://foo.bar.com/version=best/B.html 

May get revision 2.1 of A.html and 2.0 of B.html.  Surfing works.

| I strongly feel the text/config MIME type approach is the best one for
| handling browsing of collections of versioned objects.

But not in version-unaware clients!
