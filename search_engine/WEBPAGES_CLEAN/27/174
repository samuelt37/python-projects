Using Random Sampling to Find Maximum Flows  Dan Halem , ICS, UC Irvine 

We present new algorithms, based on random sampling, that find
maximum flows in undirected uncapcitated graphs. Our algorithms
dominate augmenting paths over all parameter values (number of
vertices and edges and flow value). They also dominate blocking
flows over a large range of parameter values. Furthermore, they
achieve time bounds on graphs with parallel (equivalently,
capacitated) edges that previously could only be achieved on graphs
without them.
