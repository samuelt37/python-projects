\-

\!param
These papers concern problems in which some parameter or parameters
is free, and one must explore the space of different solutions
obtained for different values of these parameters.
The  k-set problem  can be viewed
in this framework as a form of parametric median-finding,
in which the set of elements have values that are linear functions
of a single time parameter; I have also looked at other
similar parametric matroid problems as well as some parametric geometry
problems.
  
\-

\!pure
Most of my research is in the design and analysis of algorithms,
but some of my papers are completely non-algorithmic,
instead consisting of theorems about graphs or combinatorial geometry.
Some other papers, while primarily about algorithms,
also contain non-algorithmic content of independent interest.

\!graph:sgi
Subgraph isomorphism is a very general form of pattern matching in
which one attempts to find a target graph as a subgraph of a larger
input graph.  It is NP-complete, but it has many applications and
algorithms are known for many special cases.

bibliography of subgraph isomorphism algorithms and applications ,
which I collected for my SODA 95 paper.

Program transformation.
Given a (lisp) program for an invertible function, how do we automatically
find a program for the inverse function?
Considers more general simultaneous inverses of multiple functions.
The heuristic part involves type inference for finding conditionals
to use in certain if statements.

    On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms . 
D. Eppstein.  
 SIGACT News  18 (3): 38–40, 1987 .
 
A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
 alphametic )
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

 Int. Advanced Workshop on Sequences,  Positano, Italy, 1988.   Sequences: Combinatorics, Compression, Security, Transmission, 
R. M. Capocelli, ed., Springer, 1990, pp. 59–74 .
 
The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

Gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of mutations needed
to transform one input string into another, in a general model
in which substrings may be inserted or deleted at a cost depending
nonlinearly on the substring length.  The time bound
depends on the number of times the second derivative of the cost function changes sign.

    Reset sequences for monotonic automata . 
D. Eppstein.  15th Int. Coll. Automata, Languages and Programming, 
Tampere, Finland, 1988. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  317, 1988, pp. 230–238.   SIAM J. Computing  19 (3): 500–510, 1990 .
 
Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between  n 2   and  n 3  
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O( k )
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving  m  or  n 
to one involving min( m,   k ) or min( n,   k )
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the  k  smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order ( k +1) Voronoi diagrams.

Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

It was known that planar graphs have O( n ) subgraphs isomorphic
to K 3  or K 4 . That is, K 3  and
K 4  have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
  
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K x,y 
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
K x − 1,x − 1 ) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.
  
In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.
  
In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have  total length within a constant factor of
optimal . Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see " Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation " for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that  any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices .
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper " Mesh generation and optimal triangulation ".

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
 linear programming 
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in " Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers ",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

    Tree-weighted neighbors and geometric  k  smallest spanning trees . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 92-77 , ICS, UCI, 1992.  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  4: 229–238, 1994.
 
" Finding the  k  smallest spanning trees "
used higher order Voronoi diagrams to reduce the geometric
  k  smallest 
 spanning tree  problem to the graph problem.
Here I instead use nearest neighbors for a modified
distance function where the bottleneck shortest path length
is subtracted from the true distance between points.
The result improves the planar time bounds and extends
more easily to higher dimensions.

 Inf. Proc. Lett.  51: 207–211, 1994 .
 
For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
  
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
 formal
concept analysis . If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Given a sequence of edge insertions and deletions in a graph,
finds the corresponding sequence of minimum spanning tree changes,
in logarithmic time per update.
Similarly solves the planar geometric version of the problem
(using a novel "mixed MST" formulation in which part of the input
is a graph and part is a point set) in time
O(log 2  n ) for the Euclidean metric and
O(log  n  log log  n ) for the rectilinear metric.

Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
 minimum spanning tree  can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt  n ) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Speeds up a triangulation algorithm of Bern et al.
[" Linear-Size
Nonobtuse Triangulation of Polygons "] by finding a
collection of disjoint circles
which connect up the holes in a non-simple polygon.
The method is to use a
 minimum spanning tree  to find a collection of
overlapping circles, then shrink them one by one to reduce the number of
overlaps, using Sleator and
Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to keep track of the
connectivity of the shrunken circles.

Given a collection of  n  sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
 linear programming ,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both  n  and  d.

    Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

    Finding the  k  shortest paths . 
D. Eppstein.  35th IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci.,  Santa Fe, 1994, pp. 154–165.  Tech. Rep. 94-26 , ICS, UCI, 1994.  
 SIAM J. Computing  28 (2): 652–673, 1998 .
 
This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the  k  shortest in the graph, where  k  is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
  
The  k  shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
 k  shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Any  d -dimensional point set
can be triangulated
with O( n  ceil( d /2) ) simplices, none of which has
an obtuse
dihedral angle.
No bound depending only on  n  is possible 
if we require the maximum dihedral angle to measure at most 
90-epsilon degrees or the minimum dihedral to measure
at least epsilon.  Includes a
 
classification of simplices  in terms of their bad angles.

    Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems .

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, " Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families ", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.

Given a set of points with weights that are not known precisely,
but are known to fall within some range, considers the possible
weighted centroids arising from different choices of weights
in each range.  The combinatorics of this problem are closely

Speeds up 3-coloring by solving a harder problem:
constraint satisfaction in which each variable can take on
one of three values and each constraint forbids a pair of
variable assignments.  The detailed solution involves
several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,
3-edge-coloring, and 3-SAT.  The 3-SAT algorithm is fixed-parameter tractible in that it is polynomial time when the number of 3-variable clauses is O(log n).
Merged into
 3-coloring in time O(1.3289^n) 
for the journal version.

D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-13 , ICS, UCI, 1995.  Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  8: 231–240, 1997.
 
Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select  k  points that can be connected by a
small
 spanning tree .  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable  k );
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on  n  is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in
quadtrees, and a general technique
based on that in " Iterated nearest neighbors "
for reducing the dependence
on  n  in any approximation algorithm.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

 Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications  23: 43–52, 2002 .
 
Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for  empirical
network analysis  and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n c ), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

 generalized linear programming ; we also give

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

    Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   2nd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry  , Durham, North Carolina, 1997.   6th Int. Meshing Roundtable,  Park
City, Utah, 1997, pp. 7–19 .  arXiv:cs.CG/9908016 .  Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  10 (4): 347–360, 2000.
 
We use  circle-packing methods  to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
   The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
  The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
  All elements are kites, or
  All angles are at most 120 degrees.
  
In each case the total number of elements is O( n ).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

This paper shows how to use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from " Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees " for some non-geometric problems including
hierarchical clustering,

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

    Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:math.CO/9907126 .  Algorithmica  27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
 
This paper introduces the  diameter-treewidth
property  (later known as  bounded local treewidth ): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an  apex graph  G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K 3,a -free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
  Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
" subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems " but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, " Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures ",  J. ACM 
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, " Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited ",  Algorithmica 
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of  bidimensionality , a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
" The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications ",  The
Computer J.  51: 292–302, 2008.

in which the edge weights are piecewise linear functions of time that
may change unpredictably.  We solve the problem in time
O(n 2/3  polylog n)
per combinatorial change to the tree for general graphs, and in time
O(n 1/4  polylog n) per combinatorial change to the tree for planar graphs.

We consider several variations of the problem of
 coloring  the squares of a
 quadtree  so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

The idea is to apply our  dynamic closest pair

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
 regression depth  at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
 low-dimensional linear programming 
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
 minimum spanning trees ,
 shortest paths , and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.

We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".

Our program searches through a state space

for finding the successors of each state.
Successful results include a

reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg

We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's
Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the
current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In
contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,

We show that any graph can be
 colored  in time O(2.415 n ),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

    Topological issues in hexahedral meshing . 
D. Eppstein. 
Invited talk at
 Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science , Stanford, 2001.
 
We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We examine  flips  in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

    The minimum expectation selection problem .

10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.  arXiv:cs.DS/0110011 .  
 Random Structures and Algorithms  21: 278–292, 2002 .
 
We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

    Global optimization of mesh quality .

Tutorial at
10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.
 
Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

based on a Markov process rather than incremental growth.  We compare
our model with others in its ability to predict web graph clustering
behavior.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f 1 +f 2 )/(f 0 +f 3 ).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a  hyperbolic geometry 
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt; 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
 sphere packings  in R 3 .
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 599–608 .
 
We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

    Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0304018 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006 .
 
We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
 exponential time
backtracking algorithms  for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use  quasiconvex programming  to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 
  
The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

    Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0307023 .  15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  5(2):15, 2009 .
 
We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
 minimum spanning trees .

Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book  Media Theory , making journal publication moot.

We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets
in bounded-degree graphs in constant time per set, in graphs from minor
closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2 α(n)  log 2 n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
 quasiconvex programming , and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and

obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).

This follows on to our previous paper on
 using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip  by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the  hyperbolic  or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L 1  metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

it isometrically into a  hypercube , in time
O(n 2 ), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from " algorithms for media ".

axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain

equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including " Algorithms for Media ", " Algorithms for Drawing Media ", " Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces ", and
" The Lattice Dimension of a Graph ".

shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

    Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

    Animating a continuous family of two-site distance function
Voronoi diagrams (and a proof of a complexity bound on the number of

and D. Eppstein.   25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, video and

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.
  
The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

    Optimal embedding into star metrics .

Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best
paper award). 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.
 
We provide an O(n 3  log 2 n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

graph-theoretic problem on the auxiliary graph. The problems considered
include the art gallery problem, partitioning into rectangles, minimum

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper  Algorithms for Drawing Media . Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1870 .  21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms , Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.
 
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n ε -approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n 1 − ε  for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to

planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3 d/3 ) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist  Mark Lombardi , we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the  Lombardi
Spirograph , is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of
subgraph there are in a larger undirected graph, when the subgraphs have
at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.

    Privacy-preserving data-oblivious geometric algorithms for

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

    Densities of minor-closed graph families . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1009.5633 .   Electronic J. Combinatorics  17(1), Paper R136, 2010 .
 
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
 c ( n  +  o ( n ); for instance, for
planar graphs,  c  = 3. We call  c  the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ω ω , and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Suppose that  P  is the intersection of  n  halfspaces in
 D  dimensions, but that the bounded faces of  P  are at most
 d -dimensional, for some  d  that is much smaller than
 D . Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of

of  D . We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of  P , and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of  P .

There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much

of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)  
We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

    A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

Conference , Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.   Discrete
Comput. Geom.  52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013) .
 
This talk and journal paper combines the results from
" Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs " and " The graphs of
planar soap bubbles ".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.

We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a
social network have a sequence of pairwise interactions. Contiguous
subsequences of these interactions form graphs, and we develop efficient

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

sequences, orderings of the items in a learning sequence that are
consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We show that  m /5.22 vertices are sufficient

and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

    Linear-time algorithms for proportional apportionment . 
Z. Cheng and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1409.2603 .  Proc. 25th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2014) ,
Jeonju, Korea, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8889, 2014, pp. 581–592.   
We consider a broad class of  highest
averages methods  for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout,

A cuckoo filter is an approximate set data structure that can be used in
place of a Bloom filter, but with several practical advantages: it uses
less space, has better locality of reference, and can handle element
deletions. We provide the first theoretical analysis of a simplified
variation of cuckoo filters, showing that these advantages can be
guaranteed to hold theoretically and not just experimentally.

The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a

vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for

number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).

We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper

length) and the goal is to find a schedule for them to all cross the
intersection without collisions, minimizing the maximimum delay incurred
by any platoon. We show that for many types of intersections, an optimal
schedule can be found in polynomial time by a combination of dynamic
programming and parametric search.
