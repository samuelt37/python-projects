 Guard Placement For Wireless Localization 

 Presented by Nodari Sitchinava 

 
Abstract:
  
Motivated by secure wireless networking, we consider the problem of
placing fixed localizers that enable mobile communication devices to
prove they belong to a secure region that is defined by a simple
polygon. Each localizer views an infinite wedge of the plane, and a
device can prove membership in the secure region if it is inside the
wedges for a set of localizers whose common intersection contains no
points outside the polygon. This model leads to a broad class of new art
gallery type problems, for which we provide upper and lower bounds.
