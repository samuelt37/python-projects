 Meeting Place and Time 
Bren Hall 1423, Monay 1:00PM-:50PM
 Requirements and grading 
 There will be two assignments for this course. The first is a problem set on the elementary principles
of quantum computation. Collaboration on the problem set is encouraged, but you need to list who you
worked with on the problems. The second assignment of an article relation quantum computation from
the web or a magazine.
Each assignment will count 15% towards your grade. The remaining 70% is based on participation and attendance.
You must attend at least 7 out of the 8 classes to receive full credit for  participation.
