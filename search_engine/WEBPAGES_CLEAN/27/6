Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

    Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-11 , ICS, UCI, 1995.   27th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing,  Las Vegas, 1995, pp. 662–671 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  20: 463–476, 1998 .
 
Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.

Uses geometric optimization techniques to find, among  n  weighted values,
the  k  to drop so as to maximize the weighted average of the remaining values.
The feasibility test for the corresponding decision problem involves
 k -sets in a dual line arrangement.

Given a graph with edge weights that are linear functions of a parameter,
finds the sequence of
 minimum spanning trees  produced as the parameter varies,
in total time O(mn log n), by combining ideas
from " Sparsification "
and " Geometric lower bounds ".
Also solves various problems of optimizing the parameter value,
including one closely related to that in
" Choosing subsets with maximum weighted average ".

    Computational geometry and parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Invited talk ,
5th Int. Symp. Parametric Optimization, Chiba, Japan, 1997.
 
This talk surveys some connections from computational geometry to
parametric matroids: the results of my paper
" Geometric lower bounds ",
new upper bounds from a paper by Tamal Dey,
and a problem from constructive solid geometry
with the potential to lead to stronger lower bounds.

We describe algorithms for maintaining the
 minimum spanning tree  in a graph
in which the edge weights are piecewise linear functions of time that
may change unpredictably.  We solve the problem in time
O(n 2/3  polylog n)
per combinatorial change to the tree for general graphs, and in time
O(n 1/4  polylog n) per combinatorial change to the tree for planar graphs.

    Setting parameters by example .

IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci. , 1999, pp. 309–318 .  
 SIAM J. Computing  32 (3): 643–653, 2003 .
 
We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
 low-dimensional linear programming 
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
 minimum spanning trees ,
 shortest paths , and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

    Internet packet filter management and rectangle geometry . 
D. Eppstein and S. Muthukrishnan.  arXiv:cs.CG/0010018 .  
 12th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Washington, 2001, pp. 827–835 .
 
Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,
and find an O(n 3/2 ) time algorithm for testing whether
a rule set contains any ambiguities.

    The minimum expectation selection problem . 
D. Eppstein and
 G. Lueker . 
10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.  arXiv:cs.DS/0110011 .  
 Random Structures and Algorithms  21: 278–292, 2002 .
 
We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.
