	 I have a long-standing interest in more philosophical issues related to bioethics and what it means to be human in light of the current technological revolution in biology and computers, as exemplified by cloning and the Internet. This is an effort to foresee and recast progress in different areas of computational biology within a broader set of concerns. 

	 Playing acoustic guitar, especially blues and flamenco.
