 Abstract   
 
  
   
Location information gathered from a variety of sources in
the form of sensor data, video streams, human observations,
and so on, is often imprecise and uncertain and needs to
be represented approximately. To represent such uncertain
location information, the use of a probabilistic model that
captures the imprecise location as a probability density function
(pdf) has been recently proposed. The pdfs can be arbitrarily
complex depending on the type of application and
the source of imprecision. Hence, efficiently representing,
storing and querying pdfs is a very challenging task. While
the current state of the art indexing approaches treat the
representation and storage of pdfs as a black box, in this
paper, we take the challenge of representing and storing any
complex pdf in an efficient way. We further develop techniques
to index such pdfs to support the efficient processing
of location queries. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that our indexing techniques significantly outperform the
best existing solutions.
