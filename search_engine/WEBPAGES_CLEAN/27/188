  Further opportunities to adapt  
      L2 cache organization
 
  variable-size line
       L2 non-sequential prefetch
 
     L3 organization and use (for deep sub-?)
 
     In-memory adaptivity assist (DRAM tags)
 
     Multiple processor scenarios
 
  Even longer latency
  Coherence, hardware or software
  Synchronization
  Prefetch under and beyond the above
  Avoid coherence if possible
  Prefetch past synchronization
    Assist Adaptive Scheduling
