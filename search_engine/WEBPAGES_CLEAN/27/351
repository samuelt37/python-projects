 Abstract   
 
  
   
In this paper we address the problem of  reference disambiguation . Specifically,
we consider a situation where entities in the database
are referred to using descriptions (e.g., a set of instantiated attributes). 
The objective of reference 
disambiguation is to identify the unique entity to which each description corresponds. 
The key difference between the approach we propose and the traditional techniques
is that our approach analyzes not only object features but also inter-object relationships to improve 
the disambiguation quality.
Our extensive experiments over two real data sets and also over synthetic datasets 
show that analysis of relationships 
significantly improves quality of the result.
