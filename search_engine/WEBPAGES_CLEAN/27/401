 ICS 10A * Assignment 4<body>
  
  
        
 
 This assignment is due by the beginning of
your discussion section on Wednesday, October 22.  The material covered
here will appear on the midterm, so you'll want to become comfortable
with it by then.  
 
  Summary:   For this assignment, you
will measure information:  how much space some object requires, how much
it might cost to store it, how long it might take to transmit it.  Feel
free to use a calculator, spreadsheet, or other tool (such as the "word
count" feature of Microsoft Word), and to consult the web references
we mention.  
 
  Part I.  Fill in this table.  We suggest
completing the first column ("Size in bytes") first, since this
may involve a few intermediate data-gathering steps.  Bracketed numbers
(like "[12]") refer to notes and hints, which appear below the
table. 
            
 Information packages  
 
 Size in bytes (or KB, MB, GB, ...) [5]  
 
 How many copies of the information package
can you fit on one of the storage media listed below?  (Or, how many of
the storage media would it take to store one information package?)  
 
 How much would it cost to store this information
on ZIP disks? [6]  
 
 How long would it take to download this information
package using:   
   
  
 
  
 
 Floppy disks (1.4 MB)  
 
 ZIP disks (250 MB)  
 
 60 GB hard drive  
 
  
 
 A 56K modem [7]  
 
 A 52Mb cable modem   
   
 The summary paragraph above  
 
 332 bytes  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 The course syllabus [1]  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 The text of Tolstoy's  Anna Karenina 
[2]  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 A bitmap of a black &amp; white drawing, 640
     480 pixels  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 An on-screen color picture, 640      480 pixels, 16 bits/pixel  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 A high-quality 5 megapixel digital photo,
2593      
1944, 32 bits per pixel  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 A 30-second TV ad at 30 frames per second,
each frame 352      
240 pixels, 24 bits per pixel [3]  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 An 85-minute movie at 60 frames per second,
each frame 1536      
922, 32 bits per pixel, plus stereo sound [4]  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
    [1]  Recall that the syllabus is available
on line, most easily by following the link from the instructor's home
page,    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay   
. 
 
 [2]  Check Project Gutenberg at    http://promo.net/pg   
.  
 
 [3]  Assume there's no sound involved.  
 
 [4]  CD-quality stereo sound involves two
channels (left and right).  Each channel takes 44,100 samples per second,
at 16 bits per sample.  
 
 [5]  Use 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1000 KB,
1 GB = 1000 MB, and so on.  
 
 [6]  For the price of a ZIP disk, try    http://www.staples.com   
.  ZIP disks come in two sizes, 100 MB and 250 MB.  Use the 250 MB size
here.  
 
 [7]  Note that data transmission rates are
typically given in  bits  (or kilo bits  or mega bits ) per
second.  
  
  Part II.   How much space is required
by the web page you created for Assignment 2?  For now, let's just consider
the text, and not the images.  There are three different ways of measuring
it:  
 
  (a)   The size of the text displayed
in the browser.  You can get this text size by viewing your page in Navigator
or Explorer (not in Composer), selecting all the text, copying it, pasting
it into a Word document, and using the Word Count menu item.  
 
  (b)   The size of the HTML source to
your page.  You can get this by choosing View Source on your page in the
browser, selecting it all, and using the word count in Word as before.  
 
  (c)  The size of the Composer file that
contains your web page.  You can get this by checking the size of the file
in Windows; ask a classmate or your TA if you don't know how to do this.  
 
 Figure out each of these quantities.  Which
is the largest, which the smallest, and why?  (This is something you can
discuss with your classmates and TA; there's no single right answer.)  
 
 How big are the images on your web page?  
  
 For this assignment, turn your answers in
on paper.
