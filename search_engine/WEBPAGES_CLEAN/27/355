 <body>  The Locked House of Dr. Matrix  
  A Puzzle Hunt by Wei-Hwa Huang
  that occurred during G4G8, March 2008   
 
  THE RULES : 

You can solve the puzzles in any order.  However, competitive players will
probably solve most, if not all, of the puzzles in the order suggested by
Dr. Matrix:  solve a puzzle,  distill the answer into a single letter,
then go to the next puzzle with that letter.

Each player should use a puzzle log to record puzzle IDs and answers.
The puzzle log has four columns: write the  identification  letter of the puzzle
in column 1, the  solution  of the puzzle in column 2, the  single  letter
that the solution encodes to in column 3, and the  encrypted  five-letter word
in the lower-left corner of each puzzle in column 4.  On the next line,
copy the "Next" letter to the first column, and then solve that puzzle.  Repeat.

The encoding adds the ranks of the letters in the word modulo 26.  Examples:
   A 1  C 3  T 20  = X 24 
   A 1  C 3  T 20  S 19  = Q 17 
   A 1  R 18  T 20  S 19  = F 6 

Some puzzles have an upside down HINT at the bottom of the puzzle.
Don't be fooled; this is a hint for a  different  puzzle.
The starting text of each puzzle will tell you if a hint for that
puzzle is available and, if so, at what puzzle you will find it.

Once you have solved at least 13 puzzles, you may go onto Phase 2.
