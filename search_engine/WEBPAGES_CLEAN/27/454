        	     MY  Calendar  
                 
                
                Please, note that the following schedule is only tentative. Changes may be possible; henceforth, please consider this only as a rough indication of my availability.   
    
    Some meetings and commitments may not appear  for various reasons related to calendar management. Also, although I do my best to keep the schedule up to date, some appointments (including personal appointments) may still not be reported in the Academic calendar below.     You can request a meeting with me using the   
        Doodle Meetme page   or with a good old fashioned email to my UCI address. (reported in the sidebar on the left).
