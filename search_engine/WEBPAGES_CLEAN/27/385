  Search for problem solving,  
 Knowledge-representation and reasoning, logic approach,  
 Knowledge-representation and reasoning under uncertainty,  
 Learning.       Academic Honesty: 
  Academic honesty is taken seriously. It is the responsibility of
each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic honesty
policies. Please take the time to read the  current UCI Senate
Academic Honesty Policies .  
     Assignments: 

    Bi-weakly homework assignment distributed in class each week:
the homework will be given on Tuesdays and should be turned in the
following Tuesday. 
 15-20 min. quiz every Thursday (almost). 
 One programming project.  
 Final exam. 

     Procedures: 
  Some handouts will be distributed during the quarter by the
Distribution Center, others will be available to buy in the Engineering
Copy Center. 
     Course-Grade  : 
 Homeworks plus project will account for 40%, quizzes - for 20% and
final - 40% of the course grade.
