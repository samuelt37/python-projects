void OEWriteMDLFile(oemolostream &amp;ofs, OEMolBase &amp;mol,
                    unsigned int flavor = OEMDLOFlag::DEFAULT)
    
Write the molecule as a MDL mol format file to the output stream
ofs.  A number of different MDL format variants are supported by
the use of the bits in the ``flavor'' parameter.

  
The  OEMDLOFlag::MCHG  flag is used to instruct the MDL mol
file writer to write  "M  CHG"  and  "M  RAD"  lines for
charged/radical atoms in the output connection table, even if the
charge and radical values of every atom are within the ranges representable
by the MDL atom block.  By default,  "M  CHG"  and  "M  RAD" 
lines are only used for connection tables that "overflow" the allowed
atom block limits.

  
The  OEMDLOFlag::ISO  flag is used to instruct the OEChem MDL
mol file writer to write  "M  ISO"  lines for isotopes in the output
connection table, even if the isotopic masses of every atom are within
the range representable by the MDL atom block.  By default,  "M  ISO" 
lines are only used for connection tables that "overflow" the allowed
atom block limits.

  
The  OEMDLOFlag::RGP  flag is used to instruct the OEChem MDL
mol file writer to write out  "M  RGP"  entries for each R-group
atom,  i.e.  atom with element zero and a non-zero atom map index.
These atoms are always written with atomic symbol  R# .
