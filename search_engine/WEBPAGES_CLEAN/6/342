  Lesson 3 - Copyright 2:  
  Pretty Much All Writings Are Copyrighted  
  
 Let´s begin with how to obtain a copyright.  What do you 
need to do to get a copyright for something you´ve written?  
   You don´t need to send it in to the Library of Congress. 
   You don´t need to put a copyright notice on it. 
   Your work is copyrighted THE MOMENT IT´S WRITTEN DOWN. 
   
That´s right:  To get a copyright for something you´ve 
written, you need to do *absolutely nothing* except for 
writing it down. 
So the e-mail you send to a friend?  It´s copyrighted. 
(Copyright law applies to things you write electronically, 
even if they never end up actually "written" on a piece of 
paper.)  
The personal Web page you´ve put up?  It´s copyrighted.  
The memo you write on the job?  It´s copyrighted, though 
under the "work made for hire" doctrine, the copyright is 
owned by your employer.  The general rule is that anything 
you write within the scope of your employment is owned by 
the employer.  (The rule may be different if you´re an 
independent contractor, but the legal distinction between 
employee and non-employee is too complex for this seminar.)  
There are only two basic limitations here:  
   Extremely short writings - for instance, several words or shorter - or extremely simple drawings are generally not copyrighted. 
   If you simply copy what someone else has done, without adding anything new of your own, your copy is generally not copyrighted.
