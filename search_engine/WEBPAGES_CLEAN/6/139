We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

We show that thickness and  geometric thickness 
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every  t , there exists a graph with
thickness three and geometric thickness  &gt;   t . 
The proof uses  Ramsey-theoretic  arguments
similar to those in
" Separating book thickness from thickness ".

We describe a new method of
 drawing graphs , based on allowing the edges to
be merged together and drawn as "tracks" (similar to train tracks).
We present heuristics for finding such drawings
based on my previous  algorithms
for finding maximal bipartite subgraphs , prove that several
important families of graphs have confluent drawings, and provide
examples of other graphs that can not be drawn in this way.

    Algorithms for drawing media.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0406020 .  12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , New York, 2004. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3383, 2004, pp. 173–183.
 
We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
 partial cubes :
one based on
 finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph  and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.
  
Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book  Media Theory , making journal publication moot.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3843, 2006, pp. 165–176.  arXiv:cs.CG/0510024 .  
We characterize the graphs that can be drawn confluently
with a single confluent track that is tree-like except for three-way
Delta junctions, as being exactly the distance hereditary graphs.
Based on this characterization, we develop efficient algorithms
for drawing these graphs.

    Upright-quad drawing of st-planar learning spaces.

issue for GD'06).
 
We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  4372, 2007, pp. 77–88 .
 
We consider drawings of trees which, if the leaf edges were extended to
infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

We show how to choose colors for the vertices of a graph drawing in such
a way that all colors are easily distinguishable, but such that adjacent
vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

    Succinct greedy geometric routing using hyperbolic geometry . 
D. Eppstein and
 M. T. Goodrich .  arXiv:0806.0341 .  Proc. 16th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Heraklion, Crete, 2008 
(under the different title "Succinct greedy graph drawing in the
hyperbolic plane"), 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 14–25.   IEEE Transactions on Computing  60 (11): 1571–1580, 2011 .
 
Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.
  
    Isometric diamond subgraphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0807.2218 .  Proc. 16th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Heraklion, Crete, 2008. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5417, 2009, pp. 384–389.  
We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

    Drawing graphs in the plane with a prescribed outer face and
polynomial area .  E. Chambers ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 M. Löffler .  Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Konstanz, Germany, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in

Algorithms and Applications  16 (2): 243–259, 2012 .
 
Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist  Mark Lombardi , we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the  Lombardi
Spirograph , is available online.
  
    Drawing trees with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area .  C. Duncan ,

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call  Lombardi drawing ) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

and Applications  17 (3): 173–200, 2013 .
 
We show how to draw any graph of maximum degree three in three
dimensions with 120 degree angles at each vertex or bend, and any graph of
maximum degree four in three dimensions with the angles of the diamond
lattice at each vertex or bend. In each case there are no crossings and
the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

We show that a partial order has a non-crossing upward planar drawing if
and only if it has order dimension two, and we use the
Dedekind-MacNeille completion to find a drawing with the minimum
possible number of confluent junctions.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 367–378.
 
We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 308–319.  arXiv:1109.0345 .
 
We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.
  
    Planar Lombardi drawings for subcubic graphs .

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

    Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 L. Trott .  arXiv:1209.0748 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 414–425 .  
We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.
  
    On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs .  F. J. Brandenburg ,
D. Eppstein,
A. Gleißner,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
K. Hanauer, and
J. Reislhuber.  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 327–338 .  
A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.
  
    Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein, and
 J. Simons .  arXiv:1308.5741 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 340–351 .  
Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.
  
    Superpatterns and universal point sets .  M. J. Bannister ,
Z. Cheng,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0403 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 208–219 . 
Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.   J. Graph Algorithms &amp; Applications  18 (2): 177–209, 2014   (special issue for GD'13).
 
A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately  n  2 /4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.
  
   Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1308.0066 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 436–447 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  18 (2): 211–231, 2014  (special issue for GD'13).
 
The  planarity game  involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
 n  7/6 , much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

 M. Nöllenburg , and
 B. Speckmann , and
 K. Verbeek .  arXiv:1308.6824 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 352–363 .   J. Computational Geometry  7 (1): 22–46, 2016 .
 
A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.
  
    Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines . 
D. Eppstein,
M. van Garderen,
 B. Speckmann , and
 T. Ueckerdt .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing  (poster), Bordeaux, France, 2013. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.
  
    Planar induced subgraphs of sparse graphs .  G. Borradaile ,

Applications  19 (1): 281–297, 2015 .
 
We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that  m /5.22 vertices are sufficient
and  m /(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.
  
    The Galois complexity of graph drawing: why numerical solutions are
ubiquitous for force-directed, spectral, and circle packing drawings .  M. J. Bannister ,

Applications  19 (2): 619–656, 2015 .
 
We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.
  
    Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs
with bounded treewidth .  M. J. Bannister  and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1408.6321 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 210–221. 
 
We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.
  
    Balanced circle packings for planar graphs .  M. J. Alam ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 S. Kobourov , and
 S. Pupyrev .  arXiv:1408.4902 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.
  
    Flat foldings of plane graphs with prescribed angles and edge lengths .  Z. Abel ,

Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 272–283. 
 
Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

The Graph Drawing version used the alternative title
"Genus, treewidth, and local crossing number".
We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the
number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.
The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout,
and uses the title "Track Layout is Hard".

We describe a system for transforming context-free grammars into
human-readable syntax diagrams, including optimizations that change the
structure of the grammar to make it more readable without affecting the
language described by the grammar.
