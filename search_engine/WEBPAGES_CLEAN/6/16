Arcadia Project Overview 
 

The Arcadia project began work as a funded, informal consortium
in the fall of 1987.  It is a research project examining issues
in two primary areas.   First, those issues necessary to create
an evolvable software development environment based on abstract
interfaces to pro-active components, and second, issues associated
with techniques, tools, and processes for the formal definition,
analysis, evaluation, and automation of software processes and
products.

 

The project is organized into several areas of study: environment
architectures and interoperability mechanisms, user interfaces,
hypermedia, process (modeling, programming, and execution), 
object management, measurement and evaluation, language processing, 
configuration management, and analysis and testing.
The analysis area is further subdivided into concurrency
analysis, dependence and flow analysis, and analysis tool
infrastructure.

  

Prototypes are used to validate approaches taken in the individual
areas as well as to investigate technical interactions between areas.

  

The Arcadia consortium is comprised of researchers from the
University of California, Irvine (UCI), the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst (UMass), the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU), and
Purdue University.
