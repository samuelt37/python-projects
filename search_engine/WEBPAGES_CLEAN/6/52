   Component Instantiation  
        Concurrent Statement 
 ---- used in ----&gt; 
 Architecture 
            Syntax        
  

 
     instance_label: component_name
	 generic map  (generic_association_list)
	 port map  (port_association_list);
  
    
  

 
See LRM section 9.6

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The instance label is compulsory. The component name must match the
relevant component declaration. architecture STRUCT of INC is
  signal X,Y,S,C : bit;
  component HALFADD
    port(A,B : in bit;
         SUM, CARRY : out bit);
  end component;
begin
  U1: HALFADD port map (X,Y,S,C);
  -- other statements
end STRUCT;
  
    
  

 
    The association  list  defines which local signals connect to which
component ports. The association  list  above is  positional , i.e.
the signals are connected up in the order in which the ports were
declared.
 
    

 
    the alternative is  named association , where ports are
explicitly referenced and order is not important: ADDER1: HALFADD port map
    (  B =&gt; Y,     A =&gt; X,
     SUM =&gt; S, CARRY =&gt; C);
  
    
  

 
    Ports may be left unconnected using the keyword  open : ADDER2: HALFADD port map
  (B=&gt;Y,A=&gt;X,SUM=&gt;S,CARRY=&gt;open);
  
    
  

 
    An instance of a component with generics, has a  generic map 
declared before the port map: U1 : PARITY
  generic map (  N =&gt; 8)
  port map    (  A =&gt; DATA_BYTE,
               ODD =&gt; PARITY_BYTE);
  
    

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

Component instantiation is supported for synthesis, although  generic
map  is usually ignored. Whether a logic synthesis tool will "flatten
through" a component, treat it as a "black box", or recognise it as a
primitive is usually under the user's control.

 
         Whats New in '93        

In  VHDL -93, an entity-architecture pair may be directly instantiated,
i.e. a component need not be declared. This is more compact, but does
not allow the flexibility of configuration  DIRECT: entity HA_ENTITY(HA_ARCH)
              port map (A,B,S,C);
