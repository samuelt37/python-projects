 WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol Document Version History<body>
      WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol Version History 
     The WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol document specifies a
set of headers and methods which extend the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol to provide capabilities for overwrite prevention (locking),
properties, and namespace management.  It provides a standard network
protocol infrastructure for asynchronous collaborative authoring of a
wide variety of content across the Internet.

        Distributed Authoring and Versioning
      Protocol  
      Jim Cunningham, Asad Faizi 
      November 24, 1996 
      This draft is internally labelled v0.1, and also internally,
      within the HTML, lists Chris Fuchs as an author.  This draft was
       mailed
      to the discussion list .  It uses a series of HTTP methods and headers for
      remote authoring and versioning operations.  This draft caused
      quite a stir when it was mailed to the list, since it arrived
      without warning, and it's base URL (within the HTML source) was
      on a machine called "hidden-agenda".  Humorously, it turns out
      that the machine was named after a local band in which a team
      member played after hours...
