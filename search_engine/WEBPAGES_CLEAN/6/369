   Assignments   
 
  We encourage you to talk with each other and
  help each other understand how to do the assignments.  There are some limits,
  though.  Everyone should read the  guidelines for collaboration and independent work .  (Really; read it. People who ignore it risk serious trouble.) 
 We may post assignments here in advance. Any assignment posted here is a tentative draft, subject to change without notice, unti the due date of the previous assignment. After that date, we will notify you of any significant changes. The due dates themselves are tentative as well, though once the previous assignment is due we won't make the next assignment's due date any earlier than what's shown.
