  Abstract  

State explosion is the primary obstacle to practical application of 
reachability analysis techniques for detecting potential synchronization 
faults (deadlocks, races, etc.) in concurrent systems. Process algebras 
provide a useful theoretical framework for avoiding state explosion
by applying reductions at intermediate steps in a compositional analysis 
of a large system. We report on an implementation and experience with a 
tool that uses algebraic structure to perform modular, hierarchical 
analysis of systems described in an Ada-based PDL, and report on
application to a collection of well-known example problems. Although 
algebraic properties are fundamental to the approach, basic algebraic 
operations are a small portion of the tool.  Pre-analysis of the scope 
structure and communication topology of the system under test, and
data flow analysis and controlled symbolic expansion of source code 
are essential to avoiding state explosion in practice.
