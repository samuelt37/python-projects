	      Grading 

 Your class grade will be based on a class project (70%) and two
homeworks (total of 30%, each HW is worth 15%). The projects will
require submission of a progress report during the quarter, a
presentation in class during Weeks 9 or 10, and a final report. 

  Academic Honesty 
 It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with the  UCI Senate Academic Honesty Policies . For homework assignments and projects you are allowed to discuss ideas and concepts verbally with other class members, but you are not allowed to look at or copy anyone else's written solutions or code relating to homework assignments or projects. All material submitted must be material you have personally written during this quarter. Failure to adhere to this policy can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class.
