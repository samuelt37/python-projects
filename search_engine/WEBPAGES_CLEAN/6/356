      • Wide
    variety of shapes</strong>  
       
       
       
        • Often used
      in an "eye-less
      mode"</strong>    
        (due to distraction, adverse light conditions,  practice)  

                    High-tactility
  keypads necessary 
          (elevated keys, sufficient
distance between keys, material that feels different than
  chassis) 
         [audio
    feedback too much dependent on ambient noise level !]  
      • Saving
      screen real estate has high priority</strong>  
  - Icons    - Overlapping
controls (which automatically appear and disappear) - Highly targeted information provision (e.g., through personalization)   
    • Menus
    should be relatively flat </strong>   
  </strong>  Vertical
    screen size thereby does not seem to play a major role, unless it is very small
(i.e. one line only)  
    • New interaction
paradigms possible</strong>  
      
          Motion-invariant
        displays  
           
        
             
        
                      
         Touchscreen
            dragging   
        
             
        
                      
         Hand mirror metaphor   
                   
                           
         Keyhole/Flashlight
      Metaphor   
                       
           
         Texting: low cost, low intrusion on receipient and others, turn-taking,
    privacy  
  
     
 
      
        Using a
            handsfree phone while driving is not much safer than using
            a handheld phone     </strong>  
         Speaking to
          other people by phone   places
          a sufficiently dangerous cognitive load on drivers (4 times higher than
        when talking to a passenger)  
          Increases accident
        risk by a factor of 4 (equivalent to 0.08% alcohol in blood)  
          (Texting while
            driving increases the accident risk by a factor of 18  )
