         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    Conditions may overlap -  only  the statements after the
 first  "true" condition are executed.
 if (X = 5) and (Y = 9) then
	Z &lt;= A;
elsif (X &gt;= 5) then
	Z &lt;= B;
else
	Z &lt; C;
end if;  
    
  

 
    The  elsif  and  else  clauses are optional. This process
models a transparent latch:
 process (EN, D)
begin
	if (EN = '1') then Q &lt;= D;
	end if;
end process;
  
    
  

 
    A condition is any boolean expression:
 process (ALARM_TIME, CURRENT_TIME)
	variable AL_EQ_CUR: boolean;
begin
	AL_EQ_CUR := (ALARM_TIME = CURRENT_TIME);
	if AL_EQ_CUR then
		SOUND_ALARM &lt;= '1';
	else
		SOUND_ALARM &lt;= '0';
	end if;
end process;
  
    
  

 
    An  if  statement may be used to infer edge-triggered registers
in a process sensitive to a clock signal. Asynchronous reset may also be
modelled:
 process(CLK, RESET)
begin
	if RESET = '1' then
		COUNT &lt;= 0;
	elseif CLK'event and CLK='1' then
		if (COUNT &gt;= 9) then
			COUNT &lt;= 0;
		else
			COUNT &lt;= COUNT + 1;
		end if;
	end if
end process;
  
    
  

 
     If  statements may be used to specify conditional assignments
or state transitions in a finite state machine:
 case READ_CPU_STATE is
	when WAITING =&gt;
		if CPU_DATA_VALID = '1' then
			CPU_DATA_READ &lt;= '1';
			READ_CPU_STATE &lt;= DATA1;
		end if;
	when DATA1 =&gt;
	-- other branches of the case statement
end case;
  
    
  

 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

The  if  statement is generally synthesisable. Where an  if 
statement is used to detect the clock edge in a "clocked process",
certain conventions must be obeyed. Using an  if  statement without
an  else  clause in a "combinational process" can result in latches
being inferred, unless all signals driven by the process are given
unconditional default assignments. For more details see
 Process .

 
         Whats New in '93        
  

 
    In  VHDL -93, the  if  may have an optional label:
 label:  if  condition  then 
...etc
 end if  label
