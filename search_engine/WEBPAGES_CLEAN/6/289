                 Description 
                 
                     All of the chemical isomers in the database are available for download,
                    including all of their primary chemical annotations.
                    They are available for download as a collection of gzipped SDF
                    molecular format files, each about 100 MB large. 
    
                     Note that small subsets of chemicals and isomers are available
                    for download based on specific search criteria are via the
                     ChemicalSearch  page.
