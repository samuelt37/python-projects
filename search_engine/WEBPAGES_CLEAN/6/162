I recommend your reading it.  [January 23, 2003]  Debi's slides  on Endnote usage   are now available.  [January 20, 2003] Eric's slides from last Thursday are now available. See   the schedule below for the URL.  [January 16, 2003] Assignment 2 made it out by email, so I've deleted it from   this page.  [January 9, 2003] I've posted  Haig Krikorian's slides .   Note also the correct URL for the Software Architecture website:  http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/swarch /.  My  keynote talk from the STRAW '01    workshop is available.  Here's a  talk on architectures from 1999    that I'll be using parts of in class today.   That talk was refined and focused a bit for a  talk   I gave at JPL . I'll be using some of these slides as well  I now have a URL for the Perry and Wolf paper, for your convenience.

Study of the concepts, representation     techniques, development methods, and tools for architecture-centric software     engineering. Topics include domain-specific software architectures, architectural     styles, architecture description languages, software connectors, and dynamism     in architectures.   The following is a quote from Neno Medvidovic. It works for this class.     Software architecture has become an area of intense research in the software     engineering community. A number of architecture modeling notations and support     tools, as well as new architectural styles, have emerged. The focus of architecture-based     software development is shifted from lines-of-code to coarser-grained building     blocks and their overall interconnection structure. Explicit focus on architecture     has shown tremendous potential to improve the current state-of-the-art in     software development and alleviate many of its problems.    This course will expose you to the concepts, principles, and state-of- the-art     methods in software architectures, including domain-specific software architectures     (DSSA), architectural styles, architecture description languages (ADL), software     connectors, dynamism in architectures, and architecture-based testing and     analysis. In the process of studying these concepts, we will make explicit     the boundaries of the field and discuss its relationship to other areas of     software engineering, specifically requirements, design (including object-oriented     design and related notations, such as UML), and implementation. The course     will also examine the practical applicability of architecture research, specifically     its relationship to the work in software reuse and component interoperability     platforms (such as CORBA, JavaBeans, and COM/DCOM).       Textbooks   A variety of textbooks are available, including   Mary Shaw and David Garlan, Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging     Discipline, Prentice-Hall, 1996.    Paul Clements, et al., Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond,     Addison-Wesley, 2002.    Software Architecture: System Design, Development and Maintenance.

At this point   my plan is that there will not be either a term paper or a term project. Rather   I'm just going to ask you to submit weekly progress reports. The "progress"   will be with respect to a whole set of items that will be discussed in class.   Stay tuned.       Academic Dishonesty  Cheating in ICS 223 will be punished in accordance with  University policy  and   ICS policy.  Please familiarize yourself with those documents. Note that University policy states that faculty have the responsibility of "assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty." That appropriate grade, for this class, is an F. Cheating is wrong. It is lying. Don't do it.     Department of Information and Computer Science ,  University of California, Irvine CA 92697-3425  </body>
