Dynamic Planar Point Location with Sub-Logarithmic Local Updates
 
 
by Maarten LÃ¶er, Joe Simons, Darren Strash
 
 
Presented by Joe Simons 
 

 
We study planar point location in a collection of disjoint fat regions, and investigate the complexity of local updates: replacing any region by a different region that is "similar" to the original region. (i.e., the size differs by at most a constant factor, and distance between the two regions is a constant times that size). We show that it is possible to create a linear size data structure that allows for insertions, deletions, and queries in logarithmic time, and allows for local updates in sub-logarithmic time on a pointer machine.
