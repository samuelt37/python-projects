   Data Set Information:  
 These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.   I think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.)  I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set.  The attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi,  riclea  '@'  anchem.unige.it  ) 1) Alcohol 2) Malic acid 3) Ash 4) Alcalinity of ash   5) Magnesium 6) Total phenols 7) Flavanoids 8) Nonflavanoid phenols 9) Proanthocyanins 10)Color intensity 11)Hue 12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 13)Proline   In a classification context, this is a well posed problem with "well behaved" class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.            

   Attribute Information:  
 All attributes are continuous  No statistics available, but suggest to standardise variables for certain uses (e.g. for us with classifiers which are NOT scale invariant)  NOTE: 1st attribute is class identifier (1-3)

Rep. no. 92-02, (1992), Dept. of Computer Science and Dept. of    Mathematics and Statistics, James Cook University of North Queensland.    (Also submitted to Technometrics).     The data was used with many others for comparing various     classifiers. The classes are separable, though only RDA     has achieved 100% correct classification.    (RDA : 100%, QDA 99.4%, LDA 98.9%, 1NN 96.1% (z-transformed data))    (All results using the leave-one-out technique)       (2)     S.
