 AND/OR Cutset Conditioning 

 Robert Mateescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
Cutset conditioning is one of the methods of solving
reasoning tasks for graphical models, especially
when space restrictions make inference (e.g.,
jointree-clustering) algorithms infeasible. The wcutset
is a natural extention of the method to a hybrid
algoritm that performs search on the conditioning
variables and inference on the remaining problems
of induced width bounded by w. This paper
takes a fresh look at these methods through the
spectrum of AND/OR search spaces for graphical
models. The resulting AND/OR cutset method is a
strict improvement over the traditional one, often
by exponential amounts.
