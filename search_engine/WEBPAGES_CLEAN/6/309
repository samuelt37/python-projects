  Replicators : B01367/S01 

 In  
B01367/S01 , a 1x2 block forms an unstable replicator; it can be
stabilized by making four copies of itself, forming a 10c/20
replicator. 

     

 These replicators can be stabilized by pairs of small
oscillators, making larger replicator-based oscillators. The one
below has period 60. 

     

 With random initial conditions, this rule fills space with a chaotic
pattern of interacting replicators. If the initial density of live cells
is approximately 35%, the pattern also features large regions of
opposite phases (live replicators on dead backgrounds in even
generations, or vice versa) with slowly annealing region boundaries.
For densities away from this critical value, one phase or the other eventually takes over the
whole space.
