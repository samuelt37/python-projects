 Detecting and classifying pollen grains in a collected sample allows one to estimate the diversity of plant species in a particular area. This is interesting for ecological monitoring (by placing pollen traps in different areas of the world) as well as in examining fossilized pollen to determine what plant species were present at a particular time in the past. We can easily collect and image many pollen samples but identifying and counting by eye the number of grains of each species is painstaking work which we would like to automate.
 

 Specifically, we have the following projects
   
 
  Identifying three species of fossil pollen grains from spruce.
 
 
 
 
 
  Classifying large-scale modern pollen grains.
 
 
 
 
 
  Identifying fossil pollen grains based on knowledge of modern pollen grains.
 
 
 
  
 This project page is always being updated, please stay tuned!
