        Evaluating the Impact of AND/OR Search on 0-1 Integer Linear Programming    
        Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   

AND/OR search spaces accommodate advanced algorithmic schemes for
graphical models which can exploit the structure of the model. We extend and
evaluate the depth-first and best-first AND/OR search algorithms to solving 0-1
Integer Linear Programs (0-1 ILP) within this framework. We also include a class
of dynamic variable ordering heuristics while exploring an AND/OR search tree for
0-1 ILPs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these search algorithms on a variety
of benchmarks, including real-world combinatorial auctions, random uncapacitated
warehouse location problems and MAX-SAT instances.
