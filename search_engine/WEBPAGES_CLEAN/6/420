 Compiler-in-the-Loop Exploration of Programmable Embedded Systems  
Increasing complexity of embedded systems, and shortening
time-to-market makes designer productivity the key concern in embedded
system development. 
As a result Programmable Embedded Systems - that have a programmable
processor and memory subsystem to support the software part of the
application - are becoming an attractive platforms for embedded system
design. 
Programmable embedded systems greatly enhance design reuse, reduce
design complexity, and time-to-market via software. 
The application-specific, strict, multi-dimensional design
constraints, result in embedded processor designs being highly
customized. 
Embedded processors often feature design idiosyncracies,
custom-algorithms, and sometimes even miss some architectural
features.  
Consequently, code generation for the embedded processors is a
challenging task. 
However, if the compiler is able to exploit the architectural features
of the embedded processors, it can make a tremendous difference in the
power, performance, etc. of the eventual system. 
Existing embedded system design/exploration techniques either do not
consider compiler effects on the design, or include the compiler
effects in an ad-hoc manner, which may lead to inaccurate evaluation
of design choices and therefore result in suboptimal design
decisions. 

 This thesis proposes a Compiler-in-the-Loop Exploration approach, -
systematic method to include compiler effects during architectural
evaluation of embedded systems. 
This dissertation demonstrates the need and usefulness of the proposed
methodology at several levels of embedded system design abstraction:
at the the instruction set architecture level, at the processor
pipeline design level, at the memory design level, and at the
processor-memory interface level.
At each level of design abstraction, this dissertation demonstrates
that the proposed methodology results in a more meaningful exploration
of design space leading to better design decisions with respect to the
design goals of performance, code size, energy and power consumption.
