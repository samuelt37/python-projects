  Course Overview  
This course will provide an introduction to the field of
quantum computation.
Below is a list of some of the topics that will be covered:
   Introduction to quantum mechanics from the perspective of quantum information.
   Formal models of quantum computation and quantum complexity classes.
   Quantum algorithms: quantum fourier transform and applications (including
Shor's algorithm for factoring), quantum search, quantum simulation.
   Limitations on quantum computation.
   Quantum error correction.
    Prerequisites  
No formal course requirements. Students with a strong background in
either computer science, mathematics, physics or chemstry are welcome to attend.


  Course Requirements  
Problem sets will be given every  two weeks.
Students may elect to do a project in lieu of the last
problem set. This could be a paper (original work or survey paper) or a
presentation in class.

   Reading list  
There is no required text for the course.
The following is a list of books and course notes that may be useful.
At the beginning of each lecture, I will point to recommended references
for the material to be presented.
