    Course Description
  and Prerequisites    
       
    104 Human Computer  Interaction  (4).  Presents basic principles of
  human-computer interaction (HCI). Introduces students to user interface
  design techniques, design guidelines, and usability testing. Students gain
  the ability to design and evaluate user interfaces and become familiar with
  some of the outstanding research problems in HCI. Prerequisites: one course
  (with a grade of C or better) selected from ICS 10A, ICS 21, Informatics 42,
  Engineering ENGR10, CEE10, EECS10, MAE10, or equivalent. Same as Informatics
  131.

    Course Mechanics and
  Grading    
       
    Lectures  will
  focus on assigned readings but allow time for class participation. 
       
    Readings   and Textbook:  Almost all of the
  readings will be assigned from the textbook: 
   Designing the User Interface 
   Fourth Edition 
   Ben  Sheiderman 
  and Catherine  Plaisant  
   Occasionally, additional readings will be announced,
  normally with a Web link to a PDF document or power point presentation. If
  you would like additional readings, see the links page. 
       
    Class participation
   includes attendance and being able to comment relevantly on the readings.
  Students will be called upon to answer questions. Occasionally, a short quiz
  will be part of class participation, consisting of an easy question with a
  short answer, multiple choice, or true / false. 
       
    Design notebook: 
  you should begin, starting this week, a design notebook which may be as
  simple as blank sheets of paper you carry around in your pocket. On it you
  should jot down at least one example per week of a user interface success or
  failure that you encounter and make some notes about for use in assignments
  later. 
       
    No Final Exam  but
  a final assignment will be due the day of the final (by the ending time of
  the final).
