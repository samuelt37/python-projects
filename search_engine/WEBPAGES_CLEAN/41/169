   Modeling the organization of the WUSCHEL expression domain in the shoot
  apical meristem 
    This model is based on the "Activator Model" in figure 4 and equations (5)
  through (8) of the following reference:

         The SBML Level 2 Version 1 model consists of the following
        components: 

          254 Compartments 

           1265 Species 

           522 Parameters 

           4139 Reactions (2119 are diffusion, 2025 within a single
          compartment)

  (23 Feb 2006)  Download Mathematica Notebook  to
  generate SBML and run simulation. This notebook shows how to use xlr8r and
  Cellzilla or MathSBML and Cellzilla to run a simulation that is similar to
  the results in the paper. (4.6 MB arg.gz; expands to
  22.8 MB)
    (28 April 2010)  Updated
  notebook  compatible with Mathematica Version 7, xlr8r, and Cellzilla2D
  (6.4 MB Zip, expands to 33.4 MB).  For more information
  on xlr8r and Cellzilla2D  click here . 

    CellzillaML
  file  (XML file: right click to save file - it will not display properly
  in a web browser. Also requires CelleratorML file, below.) This files
  contains the geometric information as an XML file and can be used, along with
  the CelleratorML file, by Cellzilla to reproduce the model in its entirety
  (for more information on CelleratorML/CellzillaML  click here ). This information is also contained
  in the three TSV files listed below so you don't need an xml decoder to retrieve the
  information. 

    CelleratorML
  file  (XML file: right click to save file, it will not display properly in
  browser). 

   The following CSV files can be used to regenerate the template if you want
  to run the model in a different simulator. The files vertices.tsv, edges.tsv,
  and cells.tsv are equivalent to a Voronoi tessletation of centers given in
  centers.tsv (except along the L1 layers where the cells are truncated to give
  proper volume rather than extend to infinity). 

     centers.tsv  - this
    is a list of Voronoi Cell Centers, one x-y pair per line. 

      vertices.tsv  -
    this is a list of polygon vertices, that correspond to the vertices of the
    cells represented as polygons. Each line of the file contains one vertex as
    an x-y pair. 

      edges.tsv  - this is
    a list of the polygon edges, that correspond to the edges of the cells
    represented as polygons. Each line contains a pair of integers i,j, which
    means that there is an edge connecting the ith and jth vertex in the list
    in vertices.tsv. 

      cells.tsv  - this is
    a list of polygonal cells. Each line contains a list of integers. For
    example, the line "1 3 9 24 5 2" means that there is a cell composed of
    edges 1, 3, 9, 24, 5, and 2 in the list of edges in edges.tsv, which are on
    lines 1, 3, 9, 24, 5, and 2 of that file, respectively. 
     (3 May 2011)  Updated Notebook  compatible with Mathematica Version 8, Cellzilla2D, and Cambium v.09 generation.
For SBML generation see Mathematica Version 7 Notebook above.  

  Cambium Model File  (see  Cambium Project Site  for more information on Cambium) 
 
   (18 May 2011)  Single Cell SBML file  or 
 Mathematica-8 nb  for activator models. These represent the internal reactions within a 
single cell. Diffusion is not represented in this file.
