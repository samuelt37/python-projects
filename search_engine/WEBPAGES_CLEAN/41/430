bool SetMinAtoms(unsigned int)
    
This method sets the minimum number of atoms required of a subgraph
match to be returned a solution by a MCS search.  A single atom can be
a perfectly valid maximum common subgraph, however, for many
applications such a small subgraph may not be considered useful.
Setting the minimum number of atoms to a useful size prevents
unproductive subgraph matches from being returned by the
OEMCSSearch::Match method.  The default value for the minimum number
of atoms in a subgraph match is set to one upon construction of an
OEMCSSearch instance.
