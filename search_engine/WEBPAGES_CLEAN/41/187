Embedded computing devices (such as actuators, controllers and sensors of various sizes) increasingly permeate many aspects of modern life: from medical to automotive, from building and factory automation to weapons,
from critical infrastructures to home entertainment. Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are now becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for attacks, especially, malware infestations. A number of research proposals have been made to detect and/or mitigate such attacks. They vary greatly in terms of application generality and underlying assumptions. However, one common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device
(prover).
  
In this project, we stay clear of both efficient-but-limited 
software-based techniques and heavy-weight TPM-based 
approaches to attestation. We focus on the design space
area that has not been previously explored by utilizing
a software/hardware co-design approach to architect an
attestation mechanism with minimal hardware requirements.
