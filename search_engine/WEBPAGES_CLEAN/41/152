4.3 Manipulating SD File Tagged Data 
 

 
Meta information about a molecule is stored in what is known as ``tagged
data''. The most common example of this is the data fields found in SD
files. Since SD files are a common form of data storage and transfer
from one system to another, OEChem provides several methods to
manipulate this data. A simple class, OESDDataPair is used to set or
retrieve these pairs, OESDDataPair objects provide SetTag/GetTag and
SetValue/GetValue methods for access to the each half of the pair.

  
The following functions provide access to the SD data.
