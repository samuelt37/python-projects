      I enjoy playing the guitar and making music. I also like to write music-related software. Feel free to visit the links below. 
        Guitar Instruction:</strong> 
         Guitar Intelli-Generator (G.I.G.) : This applet is perhaps the most versatile guitar chord applet on the Internet. This program actually generates all the possible positions of a desired chord. There is support for full and partial capos as well as alternate tunings. Best of all, it's free to use! 
          Guitar Factory : I made this site when I was doing guitar tutoring. To play the guitar, you really only have to know two things: 1) the chords; 2) the strumming/picking patterns. The Guitar Factory will teach you how to strum and pick simple patterns. G.I.G. will teach you the chords.  

         Music:</strong> 
	     Grace Again</strong>  [  mp3 (4 MB)  ]: This is a mellow guitar instrumental that I made a while ago. It is in the alternate tuning of GCEGCD. The reason for the title is because I tried to emulate a similar guitar piece called "Grace" by Danny Donnelly, and because the ending cadence is the melody of "Amazing Grace."
	       So Amazed </strong> [  mp3 (5.2 MB)  ] [  chord sheet  ]: This song took a while to record. It is about a love that never ceases to amaze me.
