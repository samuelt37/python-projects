4.87 OEKekulize 
 
   
bool OEKekulize(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
Determine a valid Kekul√© form for a molecule.  On input, the integer
bond types of each bond should be set to 1 for single, 2 for double, 3
for triple, 4 for quadruple and 5 for an aromatic (or resonant bond).
On output, the bond order property of each bond is set to the integer
bond types, except for bonds marked type 5, which are assigned as
either single or double as required.  The formal charges and implicit
hydrogen counts of each atom must be correctly specified prior to
calling this function.
