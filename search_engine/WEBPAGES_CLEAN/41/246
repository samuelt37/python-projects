 BEpro - Discontinuous B-cell Epitope Prediction<body>
 
   
 BEpro (formerly known as PEPITO) is a predictor of discontinuous B-cell epitopes. All that is required is the tertiary structure of the antigen, in the PDB format.  
Users can request either a text file with a simplified PDB containing the predicted epitope score in the temperature field (i.e., the last column) or a visualization of the protein using Jmol colored by the epitope score.  
Higher scores correspond to a higher likelihood that the residue is in an epitope.  
Details on the performance of BEpro on the Discotope Dataset can be found  here . 
Details on the performance of BEpro on the Epitome Dataset can be found  here .

BEpro uses Jmol to visualize the epitope predictions.  For more information on Jmol, visit  http://www.jmol.org
