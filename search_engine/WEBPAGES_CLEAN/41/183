                                 Week 5, aka Midterms Week, can be incredibly stressful. Therefore, on April 29, WICS decided to host a social event and de-stress by having a movie night. Since it was Midterms Week, many members were busy and did not show up, but still about 15 people showed up to de-stress by watching movies!
