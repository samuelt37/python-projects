 Write Lock Scope<body>

  Write Lock Scope  
      The scope of a lock is an entire resource
 
  It is not possible to specify a sub-resource lock.  Why?
  The ability to create a sub-resource lock requires knowledge about the content type being locked.
  WebDAV wanted to support all content types equally, not give preferential support to a few.
  Due to the large number of content types, support for sub-resource locks would have added a lot of extra semantics to the protocol.  Some content types wouldnï¿½t have been supported.
