   A heuristic approach to program inversion . 
D. Eppstein.   9th Int. Joint Conf. Artificial
Intelligence,  Los Angeles, 1985, pp. 219–221 .
 
Program transformation.
Given a (lisp) program for an invertible function, how do we automatically
find a program for the inverse function?
Considers more general simultaneous inverses of multiple functions.
The heuristic part involves type inference for finding conditionals
to use in certain if statements.

Considers persistence for a naive form of dynamic algorithm in
which each update rebuilds a static solution.
The space bounds for this can often be reduced 
by maintaining an offline
solution over a sequence of updates constructed
from an Euler tour of the persistent update history tree.

Looks at space complexity of finding minimum simplices -- solves the problem in
O( n  2 ) space and O( n d  ) time
(matching the best known time bounds)
or in linear space at the expense of an additional log in time.
Also finds one-dimensional multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagrams in
linear time for sorted inputs (O( n  log  n ) was known).

    Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188. 
 
For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as  minimum spanning trees ,
 matching , and
 traveling salesmen ,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt  n ) and the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(log  n ).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega( n ).
For traveling salesmen the O(log  n ) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
 d th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

Any  d -dimensional point set
can be triangulated
with O( n  ceil( d /2) ) simplices, none of which has
an obtuse
dihedral angle.
No bound depending only on  n  is possible 
if we require the maximum dihedral angle to measure at most 
90-epsilon degrees or the minimum dihedral to measure
at least epsilon.  Includes a
 
classification of simplices  in terms of their bad angles.

    Representing all minimum spanning trees with applications to

Shows how to find for any edge weighted graph G an equivalent
graph EG such that the  minimum spanning trees 
of G correspond one-for-one with the spanning trees of EG.
The equivalent graph can be
constructed in time O(m+n log n) given a single minimum spanning tree of
G.  As a consequence one can find fast algorithms for counting, listing,
and randomly generating MSTs.
Also discusses similar
equivalent graph constructions for
 shortest paths , minimum cost flows,

Any bipartite Eulerian graph, any Eulerian graph with evenly many vertices,
and any bipartite graph with evenly many vertices and edges, has an even
number of
 spanning trees .
More generally, a graph has evenly many spanning trees if and only if it
has an Eulerian edge cut.

Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets
of prioritized rectangles; the rule to use for a packet is the maximum
priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,

results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
 graph drawing , viewpoint selection in
 hyperbolic  browsing, and element size

    Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation .  M. Bern 
and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0207081 .  
 14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129 .
 
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0212007 .  
 19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281 .
 
We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n 3 ), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
 quasiconvex programming  algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We

efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

We consider problems of determining when a curve in the plane is the
projection of a 3d surface with no vertical tangents. Several problems
of this type are NP-complete, but can be solved in polynomial time if a
casing of the curve is also given.

    Dilation, smoothed distance, and minimization diagrams of
convex functions .  M. Dickerson ,

 K. Wortman .  arXiv:0812.0607 .   7th Int. Symp. Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering (ISVD
2010) , Quebec City, Canada, pp. 13–22 .
 
Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.
  
    Animating a continuous family of two-site distance function
Voronoi diagrams (and a proof of a complexity bound on the number of
non-empty regions) .  M. Dickerson 
and D. Eppstein.   25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, video and
multimedia track, pp. 92–93 .
 
We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.
  
    On the approximability of geometric and geographic generalization

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5664, 2009, pp. 242–253.
 
We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.
  
The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

    Optimal embedding into star metrics .

Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best
paper award). 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.
 
We provide an O(n 3  log 2 n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  5911, 2009, pp. 1–16.  arXiv:0908.3916 .
 
We survey problems in computational geometry that may be solved by
constructing an auxiliary graph from the problem and solving a
graph-theoretic problem on the auxiliary graph. The problems considered
include the art gallery problem, partitioning into rectangles, minimum
diameter clustering, bend minimization in cartogram construction, mesh
stripification, optimal angular resolution, and metric embedding.

We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns
can die out completely, with the aim of finding rules with interesting
behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life. We survey a number of such rules.
  
    Cloning Voronoi diagrams via retroactive data structures .  M. Dickerson ,

Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6346, 2010, pp. 362–373 .  
We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

    Listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs in near-optimal time . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. Löffler , and
 D. Strash .  arXiv:1006.5440 . 
Workshop on Exact Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems, Dagstuhl, Germany, 2010.  Proc. 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation
(ISAAC 2010) , Jeju, Korea, 2010.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  6506, 2010, pp. 403–414 .  
We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3 d/3 ) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.
  
For the journal version, see " Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal
time ," which combines results from this and a different conference paper.
  
    Privacy-preserving data-oblivious geometric algorithms for
geographic data . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 R. Tamassia .   Proc. 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL Int. Conf. Advances in Geographic
Information Systems (ACM GIS 2010) , San Jose, California, pp. 13–22 .  arXiv:1009.1904 .
 
An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

We experiment with our  degeneracy-based
algorithm for listing maximal cliques in sparse graphs  and show that
it works well on large graphs drawn from several repositories of
real-world social networks and bioinformatics networks.

2011. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  6844, 2011, pp. 362–373.
 
We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.
  
    What's the difference? Efficient set reconciliation without prior
context . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
F. Uyeda, and
 G. Varghese .   Proc. ACM SIGCOMM , Toronto, Canada, 2011 .
 
We determine the symmetric difference
between two similar sets of items, held by different machines on the
internet, using an amount of communication bandwidth that is
proportional only to the difference between the sets and with low
computational overhead. Our solution technique combines the invertible
Bloom filter data structure from our previous
work on  streaming straggler detection 
with a randomized sampling scheme that allows us to accurately and
efficiently estimate the size of the difference.
  
    Planar and poly-arc Lombardi drawings .  C. Duncan ,
D. Eppstein,

Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7034, 2012, pp. 308–319.  arXiv:1109.0345 .
 
We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.
  
    Randomized speedup of the Bellman–Ford algorithm .  M. J. Bannister  and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1111.5414 .   Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO12) , Kyoto, Japan, 2012, pp. 41–47 .
 
The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

Venice, Italy, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  7288, 2012, pp. 142–153 .
 
We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

We use a method based on intersecting obstacles with line segments in
order to uniformly sample from obstacle surfaces in the probabilistic

    Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 L. Trott .  arXiv:1209.0748 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 414–425 .  
We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.
  
    On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs .  F. J. Brandenburg ,
D. Eppstein,
A. Gleißner,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
K. Hanauer, and
J. Reislhuber.  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 327–338 .  
A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on  n  vertices may have as many as
4 n  − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45 n /17 + O(1) edges.

pp. 856–864.   arXiv:1209.5791 .
 
We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a
social network have a sequence of pairwise interactions. Contiguous
subsequences of these interactions form graphs, and we develop efficient
data structures for querying the parameters of these graphs.
  
    Parameterized complexity of 1-planarity .  M. J. Bannister ,

13th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2013), London, Ontario  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8037 , 2013, pp. 97–108 .  
We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

    Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees .  M. J. Bannister ,

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.
  
    Small superpatterns for dominance drawing .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1310.3770 .  Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14) , Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.
 
We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O( n  3/2 ), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O( n  log  n ), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

2014) , Copenhagen, Denmark, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8504, pp. 162–173, 2014 .
 
We study cuckoo hashing data structures in a model of flash memory in
which each memory cell has a limited number of times it can be changed,
so the goal is to prevent hot spots that change many times.
  
    Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs

D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1408.6321 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 210–221. 
 
We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.
  
    Balanced circle packings for planar graphs .  M. J. Alam ,

 S. Pupyrev .  arXiv:1408.4902 .  22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Würzburg, Germany, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8871, 2014, pp. 125–136. 
 
The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.
  
    Linear-time algorithms for proportional apportionment . 
Z. Cheng and D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1409.2603 .  Proc. 25th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2014) ,
Jeonju, Korea, 2014.  Springer,  Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci.  8889, 2014, pp. 581–592.   
We consider a broad class of  highest
averages methods  for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.
  
    Minimum forcing sets for Miura folding patterns .  B. Ballinger ,

J. Ginepro, and
 T. Hull .  arXiv:1410.2231 .   26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms , San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147 .
 
A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

We give the first known near-linear algorithms for constructing
Gomory–Hu trees of bounded-genus graphs, and we shave a log off

    ERGMs are hard .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1412.1787 .  
ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.

 A. Hesterberg ,
 I. Kostitsyna , and
 C. Schmidt .   27th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry , Kingston, Ontario,
Canada, 2015, pp. 101–106 .  
We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.
  
    Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled

 V. Dujmović ,
D. Eppstein, and
 D. R. Wood .  arXiv:1506.09145 .  24th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Athens, Greece, 2016.  
We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.
The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout,
and uses the title "Track Layout is Hard".

We describe a system for transforming context-free grammars into
human-readable syntax diagrams, including optimizations that change the
structure of the grammar to make it more readable without affecting the
language described by the grammar.
  
    Treetopes and their graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1510.03152 .   27th ACM-SIAM
Symp. on Discrete Algorithms , Arlington, 2016, pp. 969–984 .  
We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

A cuckoo filter is an approximate set data structure that can be used in
place of a Bloom filter, but with several practical advantages: it uses
less space, has better locality of reference, and can handle element
deletions. We provide the first theoretical analysis of a simplified
variation of cuckoo filters, showing that these advantages can be
guaranteed to hold theoretically and not just experimentally.

    The computational hardness of  d K-series .  W. E. Devanny ,

B. Tilman.  NetSci2016  poster session, Seoul, Korea.
 
The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
 d -dimensional tensor, describing the number of  d -tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any  d  ≥ 3, or for  d  = 2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).

We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.
  
    Scheduling autonomous vehicle platoons through an unregulated
intersection .

Dagstuhl (2016), pp. 5:1–5.16 .  arXiv:1609.04512 .  
We consider a model of vehicle scheduling in which vehicles arrive at an
intersection in indivisible platoons (or individual vehicles of variable
length) and the goal is to find a schedule for them to all cross the
intersection without collisions, minimizing the maximimum delay incurred
by any platoon. We show that for many types of intersections, an optimal
schedule can be found in polynomial time by a combination of dynamic
programming and parametric search.
