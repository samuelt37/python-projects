                     :: Frequently Asked Questions  
                  
                    Q.</strong>  So what's happening at Motorola labs with the Google acquisition and all?    A.</strong> Unfortunately, Google
                     recently  sold 
                     the Motorola Home division to Arris.
                     Motorola labs which has traditionally been funded by the Home business unit will now become
                     part of Arris.
                 
                   
                    Q.</strong>  I want to get an internship / full-time position at Motorola Research.
                    Can you help?    A.</strong> Currently, Motorola labs has a complete hiring freeze. So I will not be able to
                    help with internships or full-time positions.
                 
                   
                    Q.</strong>  You and your team have produced so many interesting applications. Why are
                    they not on the app store(s)?   A.</strong> Much of the work we have done in the research labs have been prototypes
                    for internal show and tell. Again, many of the concepts and ideas are published in journals
                    and patent disclosures. If we had the resources, much of our creations could have been products
                    on the app stores. But sadly, we have had fewer and fewer resources over the years. However,
                    some of the prototypes we have worked on are well on their way to becoming products in some
                    form or the other.
