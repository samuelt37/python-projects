 Ape City? 
 
 
Yep, Ape City. When they made
 
"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" ,
the fourth of the Planet of the Apes series,
the filmmakers wanted to find a location for the futuristic city
conquered by the apes. They found the perfect location on the UC
Irvine campus.

  
Now, many years ago, when I first learned this fabulous fact,
I came across a web page positively  replete  with photos of the
campus infested with apes. When I went looking again, though,

Robert Nideffer , who Photoshop'd them to perfection.

The Social Science plaza features extensively in the movie. In fact,
in the end, the apes defeat Man by setting fire to Social
Science. I'm sure there's some symbolism hidden there...
