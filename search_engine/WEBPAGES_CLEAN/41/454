  Interdependencies  
      The enabling technologies for automation and collaboration are interdependent
 
  XML is the key to automation, and is the format of WebDAV properties
  WebDAV properties provide metadata storage with Web resources, linking XML to the resources they describe
  ISEN provides awareness of activities of collaborators using WebDAV
  A collaborator has been added, or a lock has been released
