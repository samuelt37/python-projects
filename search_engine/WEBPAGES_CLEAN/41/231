        Mixed deterministic and probabilistic networks    
       Robert Mateescu and Rina Dechter     
              Abstract   
         The paper introduces mixed networks, a new graphical model framework
for expressing and reasoning with probabilistic and deterministic information. The
motivation to develop mixed networks stems from the desire to fully exploit the
deterministic information (constraints) that is often present in graphical models.
Several concepts and algorithms specific to belief networks and constraint networks
are combined, achieving computational efficiency, semantic coherence and user-
interface convenience. We define the semantics and graphical representation of
mixed networks, and discuss the two main types of algorithms for processing them:
inference-based and search-based. A preliminary experimental evaluation shows the
benefits of the new model.
