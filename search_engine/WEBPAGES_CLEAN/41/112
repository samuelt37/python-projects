            Intelligent Design Evident in the Breathing of Insects    
        
           
               Did you know that an insect can hold its breath for several minutes? According to a a new study conducted by Timothy Bradley, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCI, and Stefan Hetz, assistant professor of physiology at Humboldt, insects do this in order to avoid tissue damage from excess oxygen. The interesting thing is that insects know how to regulate the oxygen within their bodies.  Here's an  excerpt  http://www.today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1276 :   Bradley explained that insects typically maintain 4-5 kilopascals of oxygen in their respiratory systems, 4-5 times lower than the normal oxygen concentration in the atmosphere. In a normal oxygen-concentration environment, the insect breathes for a period of time and releases a burst of carbon dioxide. It then closes its respiratory system, blocking off more intake of oxygen, to maintain the internal oxygen concentration at 4-5 kilopascals, the right oxygen concentration for its body. In a low-oxygen environment, the insect opens its respiratory system for longer periods of time; when it closes the system, it does so for only a very short time. In a stream of air with high oxygen on the other hand, the respiratory system opens briefly and then closes firmly for a long time. "In other words, insects are actively keeping oxygen out and doing it in a way that shows they know how to measure oxygen," Bradley said. "Their behavior indicates they are regulating oxygen."   This is pretty amazing. Are scientists willing to attribute the origin of this functionality to intelligent design? Don't hold your breath.
