Reconstructing a Three-Dimensional Model with Arbitrary Errors  Thuan Do , ICS, UC
Irvine 

A number of current technologies allow for the determination of
inter-atomic distance information in structures such as proteins
and RNA. Thus, the reconstruction of a three-dimensional set of
points using information about its inter-point distances has become
a task of basic importance in determining molecular structure. But
the measurements are error-prone and some of the entries of the
mesured distance matrix are arbitrarity "corrupted." 

 In this paper, the authors present an algorithm which runs in
O( n  log  n ) time, where  n  is the
number of points, and that algorithm can reconstruct the model of
points  P  from its distance matrix, which has many errors and
which is also not complete. The algorithm will produce a constant
number of point sets consistent to a given distance matrix  
M , and one of them will be the correct point set  P .
