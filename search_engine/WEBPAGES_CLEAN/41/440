Planar Lombardi Drawings for Subcubic Graphs
 
 
David Eppstein
 
 
We prove that every planar graph with maximum degree
three has a planar drawing in which the edges are drawn as circular
arcs that meet at equal angles around every vertex. Our construction
is based on the Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle packing theorem, and
uses a novel type of Voronoi diagram for circle packings that is
invariant
under Mobius transformations, defined using three-dimensional
hyperbolic
geometry. We also use circle packing to construct planar Lombardi
drawings of a special class of 4-regular planar graphs, the medial
graphs
of polyhedral graphs, and we show that not every 4-regular planar
graph
has a planar Lombardi drawing. We have implemented our algorithm for
3-connected planar cubic graphs.
