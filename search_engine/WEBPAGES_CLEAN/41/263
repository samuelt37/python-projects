   General
Educational Aims:     This class is
concerned with advanced user interaction and interface architectures,
focusing specifically on privacy architectures for electronic
environments. Emphasis will be put on privacy protections in upcoming
Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor environments. Students will       learn
about prescriptive approaches to help safeguard privacy (laws, design
strategies, privacy-analysis templates). Using an IoT deployment as an
application example, they will then write a privacy impact analysis,
conduct an empirical study to determine   factors
that influence people's privacy-related decisions (e.g., their
willingness to disclose personal data to an IoT environment), and
design a tool that allows people to express their privacy preferences
to the IoT environment.    
  The
class is research and practice oriented and forms a good introduction to
a  privacy engineering  career (Cranor &amp; Sadeh  2013a ,  2013b )
