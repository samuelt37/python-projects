 C++/Eclipse Download and Installation/Mac 
 
  
  
Here are the links Jianfeng Jia, our TA, sent me for those wanting to install
  Eclipse/G++ on their Macs.
He said:
   
About the Eclipse/C++ installation, I'm using the eclipse Kepler, and installed
  the CDT as a plugin.
I think the orginal  CDT  should also
  work.
 
For the toolchain editor for all the lib and executions, I was using the
 "MacOSX GCC" , and for the further Linker setting, setting the corresponding
  Library path in  the "MacOSX C++ Linker". 
I don't know where does this GCC come from, it might go with CDT, or get
  installed by the previous Xcode (by 
   this ) ?)
  
All the other setting is the same as your instructions. 
   
About the courselib, they may see the problem like this:
  dyld: Library not loaded 
They need to export the  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  environment variable to the
  absolute path of courselib/Debug/. 
I found one  blog  mentioned to
  set it inside eclipse: Property -&gt; Run/Debug Settings , choose project name,
  click "edit",  choose "Environment" tab -&gt; click "new" to add such variable.
