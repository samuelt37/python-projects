        Refined Bounds for Instance-Based Search Complexity
        of Counting and Other #P Problems

              Abstract   

           We present measures for bounding the instance-based complexity of
AND/OR search algorithms for solution counting and related #P problems. To
this end we estimate the size of the search space, with special consideration given
to the impact of determinism in a problem. The resulting schemes are evaluated
empirically on a variety of problem instances and shown to be quite powerful.
