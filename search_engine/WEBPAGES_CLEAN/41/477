 The Relationship Between AND/OR Search and Variable Elimination 

 Robert Mateescu and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
In this paper we compare search and inference
in graphical models through the new framework
of AND/OR search. Specifically, we compare
Variable Elimination (VE) and memoryintensive
AND/OR Search (AO) and place algorithms
such as graph-based backjumping and
no-good and good learning, as well as Recursive
Conditioning [7] and Value Elimination [2]
within the AND/OR search framework.
