    External Memory Geometric Data Structures: Part II 
 
  Nodari Sitchinava, UCI 

 
I will continue the overview of the geometric data structures for the 
external memory model. I will talk about the data structures for 
batched off-line queries. In particular, I will cover the buffer 
tree data structure and the challenges of parallelizing it.
