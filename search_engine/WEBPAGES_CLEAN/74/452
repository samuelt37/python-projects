 Guaranteed-Accurate Floating-Point Summation 

 Yong-Kang Zhu 

 Abstract: 

 Summation of many floating-point numbers introduces many rounding
errors.  When the data are ill-conditioned, the computed sum can be far
from the exact sum, being overwhelmed with roundoff error.  Dekker and
Knuth independently invented an algorithm called  AddTwo 
that adds two floating-point numbers together while simultaneously
computing the exact roundoff error. Based on  AddTwo , we
present an algorithm,  SimpleSum , which repeatedly calls
 AddTwo . Given an array  x  of summands we prove that,
after finite iterations of the outer loop,  SimpleSum 
reaches a steady state in which  x  is sorted by increasing
magnitude, non-overlapping mantissas, and fixed exponents, such that
from  x n   to  x  1  each element contains
a smaller-and smaller component of the roundoff error.  That is, the
converged state of the array contains a full, exact and optimally
compact representation of the sum of the original array. The algorithm
works for any floating-point base. 

 Then, we will briefly outline a more sophisticated algorithm based
on the same principle, that runs in practice in only two "for"
loops, on average, and a "hybrid" that uses some other ideas to
run even faster.
