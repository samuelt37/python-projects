Abstract:
A loop cutset is a set of vertices V such that removing that set V and all
adjacent edges to V from a graph G, the resulting graph is a forest of
trees.  The authors give a randomized algorithm for finding a minimum loop
cutset after O( ckn 6  k  ) steps with probability
1 - (1 - 6 - k  )  c 6   k    ,
where  c  &gt; 1 is a constant specified by the user,
 k  is the minimum size of a
minimum loop cutset, and  n  is the number of vertices.
