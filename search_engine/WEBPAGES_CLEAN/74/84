This abstract base-class defines predicates in OEChem.  Predicates are a
special class of functors which, by convention, has several restriction.  These
restrictions make predicates predictable and reliable.  To the degree possible,
these restrictions are enforced by the api.  CreateCopy is a virtual
constructor which allows copying of concrete derived objects using a reference
to this base class.

  
By definition, a predicates is a functor which always return a boolean.  By
convention, the operator() of a predicate does not modify the object it takes
as an argument and itself is not modified by the evaluation.  These conventions
guarentee that the result of a series of predicate evaluations will not be
order dependent.
