 Environmental Informatics 

 
 





 
     Research Faculty      »</strong>  Pierre  Baldi     »</strong>  Paul  Dourish     »</strong>  Bill  Tomlinson     Humanity is currently facing a range of significant environmental challenges such as global warming, species extinction, pollution, and overpopulation.  Informatics tools and techniques can help facilitate responses to these challenges, and assist with planning for future environmental issues. 
 Researchers in the Bren School are working on projects relating to scientific collaboration, environmental monitoring, interactive education, social networking, and a wide range of other environmental topics.   
 These efforts involve collaborations with faculty from departments around campus including Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology, Chemical Engineering &amp; Materials Science, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Education, and Operations &amp; Decision Technologies.   
 By connecting research on computing and information science with work in these and other fields, environmental informatics can help human civilizations move toward more sustainable ways of living.
