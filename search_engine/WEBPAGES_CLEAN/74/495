3.39.4 operator bool 
 
   
operator bool() const
    
This method will return true if the  OEUniMolecularRxn  was
initialized with no failures using either the initialization
constructors or one of the  OEUniMolecularRxn::Init  methods.
The method will return false when the  OEUniMolecularRxn 
instance has not been properly initialized as it will be unable to
apply transform operations to molecules.
