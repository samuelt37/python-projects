  A  binary string 
is a sequence of 0's and 1's. 
 

 Let  Σ  be the set {0,1}. 
Then the set of finite binary strings is written as  Σ *,
and the set of finite and infinite binary strings is written as  Σ **. 
(The same notation is used for other alphabets other than 0 and 1.) 
 
 
 Σ * can be ordered by the prefix relation,
as can  Σ **: 
for u,v ∈  Σ * ( Σ **), u is a  prefix  of v if either
u=v or
u is a finite initial substring of v. 
We write u≤v if u is a prefix of v,
and u||v if neither u nor v is a prefix of the other
(some authors write u#v). 
 

  Here are some examples:
 

   The empty string  ε  is a binary string. 
     ε  is in both  Σ * and  Σ **. 
   
    0 and 1 are finite binary strings, and are in both
     Σ * and  Σ **, as are all finite binary strings. 
   
    010101... is an infinite binary string. 
    It is in  Σ ** but not  Σ *. 
   
   0 ≤010101...
     0 is a prefix of 010101....
   
   1 || 010101...
     1 is not a prefix of 010101..., nor is 010101... a prefix of 1;
    they are incomparable. 
    In fact, 010101... is not a prefix of anything (because it is not finite). 
   
   00 ≤ 000
   
   00 || 0101
