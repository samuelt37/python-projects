 Temporal Constraints: A Survey 
 Schwalb, E. and L. Vila 
      
  
 Abstract  
Abstract. Temporal Constraint Satisfaction is an information technology useful for 
representing and answering queries about the times of events and the temporal relations between them.
Information is represented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where variables denote
event times and constraints represent the possible temporal relations between them. The main
tasks are two: (i) deciding consistency, and (ii) answering queries about scenarios that satisfy
all constraints. This paper overviews results on several classes of Temporal CSPs: qualitative
interval, qualitative point, metric point, and some of their combinations. Research has progressed
along three lines: (i) identifying tractable subclasses, (ii) developing exact search algorithms, and
(iii) developing polynomial-time approximation algorithms. Most available techniques are based
on two principles: (i) enforcing local consistency (e.g. path-consistency), and (ii) enhancing naive
backtracking search.
