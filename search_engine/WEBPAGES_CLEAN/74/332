 Abstract: 

 We introduce the concept of region-fault tolerant spanners for planar
point sets, and prove the existence of region-fault tolerant spanners of
small size.  For a geometric graph  G  on a point set  P  and
region  F , we define  G  -  F  to be what
remains of  G  after the vertices and edges of  G 
intersecting  F  have been removed.  A  C -fault tolerant
 t -spanner is a geometric graph  G  on  P  such that for
any convex region  F , the graph  G  -  F  is a
 t -spanner for
 G   c  ( P ) -  F , where
 G   c  ( P ) is the complete geometric graph on
 P . We prove that any set  P  of  n  points admits a
 C -fault tolerant (1+ε)-spanner of size
O( n  log  n ) for any constant
ε &gt; 0; if adding Steiner points is allowed then the
size of the spanner reduces to O( n ), and for several special
cases we show how to obtain region-fault tolerant spanners of
O( n ) size without using Steiner points.
