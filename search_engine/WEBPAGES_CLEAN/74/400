Presenting a SODA 2009 paper by Haim Kaplan and Uri Zwick

  
Abstract: 
The Soft Heap is an approximate, meldable priority queue created by
Bernard Chazelle. The idea is genius: allow a fraction of the items
inserted into the priority queue to have their keys artificially
increased (corrupted), and in exchange, we get fast operations. We
describe a new, simpler implementation of the Soft Heap, and discuss
the clever ways that Soft Heaps have been used in the literature.
