A Randomized Algorithm for Constructing the Trapezoidal Map Induced by a 
Connected Geometric Graph
 

 Darren Strash 

 
 Abstract: 
  
We discuss the general problem of constructing the trapezoidal map 
induced by a set of line segments in the plane, and present preliminary 
results for a randomized algorithm for the special case when the line 
segments form a connected geometric graph.
  
This is joint work with Michael Goodrich.
