		       1.   EMG dataset in Lower Limb  : 3 different exercises: sitting, standing and walking in the muscles: biceps femoris, vastus medialis, rectus femoris and semitendinosus addition to goniometry in the exercises.  2.   Pioneer-1 Mobile Robot Data  : This dataset contains time series sensor readings of the Pioneer-1 mobile robot. The data is broken into "experiences" in which the robot takes action for some period of time and experiences a control  3.   Predict keywords activities in a online social media  : The data from Twitter was collected during 360 consecutive days. It was done by querying 1497 English keywords sampled from Wikipedia.
