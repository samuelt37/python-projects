Ito will close the symposium with her afternoon keynote presentation. She is known internationally for her expertise on how people use mobile technologies and new digital media in their everyday lives. She serves as research director of the Digital Media and Learning Hub and chair of the Connected Learning Research Network, both part of the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning initiative that investigates how today’s digital and networked media can be mobilized for the longstanding goals of progressive education. She co-led the Digital Youth Project, a landmark study of the ways young people use new media as part of the initiative. She is co-author of the book based on the study: "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."
