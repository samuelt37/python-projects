       Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate education, you could say I've taken a few classes and written a few  papers .  Below is a mostly-inclusive list of courses I've taken.  There are a handful of courses I've sat in on during my undergraduate and graduate years that are not on this list, as are a few extracurricular activities.  For those that I can remember, I've placed them in parenthesis.  

If everything goes as planned, I'll have all but one class completed for the master's portion of my Ph.D after Spring 2004, and I will have passed my Phase II qualifying exam on May 21.   Graduate Work   Spring 2005:
