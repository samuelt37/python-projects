 1st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, 
San Francisco, 1990, pp. 107–118 .   Algorithmica  11: 360–378, 1994 .
 
An investigation of 3d visibility problems in which the viewing
position moves along a straight flight path, with various
assumptions on the complexity of the viewed scene.

    Triangulating polygons without large angles .  M. Bern ,
 D. Dobkin ,
and D. Eppstein.  
 8th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Berlin, 1992, pp. 222–231 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  5: 171–192, 1995 
(special issue for 8th Symp. Comput. Geom.)
 
Follows up " Polynomial size non-obtuse
triangulation of polygons ";
improves the number of triangles by relaxing the requirements on their angles.
Again mostly subsumed by results of Bern et al described in
" Faster circle packing ".

    Computing the discrepancy .  
D. P. Dobkin  and D. Eppstein.   9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  San Diego, 1993, pp. 47–52. 
 
Measures how well a sample of points from a set works as a discrete
approximation to the continuous measure of shapes in the set,
using algorithms based on Overmars and van Leeuwen's dynamic convex hull
data structure.
Some versions of the problem also involve subroutines
for finding the deepest point in an arrangement of quadrants or orthants.
  
This paper was merged with results of Mitchell to form the journal version,
" Computing the discrepancy with applications
to supersampling patterns ".

    Computing the discrepancy with applications to supersampling patterns .  D. P. Dobkin ,
D. Eppstein, and
 D. P. Mitchell .   ACM Trans. on Graphics  15 (4): 354–376, 1996. 
 
Combines " Computing the discrepancy "
with experimental results of Mitchell on the discrepancies of various point sets,
emphasizing the application of low-discrepancy sets to anti-aliasing in
raytraced graphics.

    Emerging challenges in computational topology .  M. Bern ,
D. Eppstein, et al.  arXiv:cs.CG/9909001 .  
This is the report from the ACM Workshop on Computational Topology
run by Marshall and myself in Miami Beach, June 1999.
It details goals, current research, and recommendations
in this emerging area of collaboration between computer science and
mathematics.
