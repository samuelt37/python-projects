    Plug &amp; Play Models for Video Game Systems 


 
   
    January 2012 to March 2012
   
  
   Developed a set of Plug &amp; Play Models for Video Game systems. These models were developed with the aim of assisting game designers and engineers to identify the baseline requirements in their games which they can then modify to the specific requirements of the game that they are developing. The fact that there exists a common feature set across all games that are or may exist, is leveraged in this approach. 

 

  TL;DR  - Start up kit for carrying out Requirements engineering for Video Games.
