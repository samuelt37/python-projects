 Wiki internal links 
   One of the most important features of the wiki is the internal linking to other wiki pages, therefore it is quite simple.       
  WikiNames ("CamelCase") 
   If you WriteWordsTogether like FistnameLastname or  CamelCase  or  MoinMoin , so that there are at least two changes between capital letters and lower case letters,  MoinMoin  will automatically link this word to the page of the same name.       This is quite simple, because wiki markup isn't necessary. But the unusual syntax isn't everyone's cup of tea, so there is one more alternative, the so-called "free link".       
  Input 
           CamelCase !CamelCaseButNotLinked      
  Display 
      CamelCase  CamelCaseButNotLinked         
  Free links 
   If you want to link pages, which aren't in  CamelCase  or if you just don't like  CamelCase , you can also link this way:       
  Input 
           A [[free link]] and [[other page|another page]].      
  Display 
     A  free link  and  another page .       
  Tracing backwards from links 
   If you click on the page name in the navigation area, the wiki looks for pages which link to this page name.       This can be used for so-called wiki badges. You just write somewhere:        ToDo : Call costumer foobar regarding ...        ToDo  is  CamelCase , so it links to a homonymous page, which isn't very exiting.          But you can click on the page name on the page  ToDo  and lo and behold, you find every page that also includes a  ToDo .
