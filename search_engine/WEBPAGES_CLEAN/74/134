Key Challenges for Software

     Today the Web is read-only, with forms support
 
  Visualize source code (Javadoc)
  Submit problem reports (PHP)
       But, support for writing to the Web is limited
 
  Want to remotely edit source code, design documents, requirements, etc.
  Canï¿½t do that with forms!       --&gt;
