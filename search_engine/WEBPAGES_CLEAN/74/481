virtual OEExprBase *CreateCopy()
    
This pure virtual copy constructor should return a deep copy of the
OEExprBase object.  The copy of the object returned is in memory now
owned by the user making the function call.  It is the responsibility
of the programmer to manage the memory created and returned by this
method.
