2  Submission 
 Monday, 19 August 1996. 
 
   Transfer your Homework 2 from your Macintosh disk to your
 ea.oac.uci.edu  or  orion.oac.uci.edu  account, giving it the
name  hw2done.html .

  Use  lynx  to view the file as an HTML document:      ea&gt; lynx hw2done.html 
 
This allows you to verify that the transfer has gone correctly.

   At this point , you can e-mail your homework to
 ics1c@ics.uci.edu .
 
Your message should use ``HW2 Submit'' as its "Subject"
and its body should be the contents of
 hw2done.html  and nothing more.
 
You may also choose to wait to send this mail until you have
completed the steps outlined below.

  If you have an  ea.oac.uci.edu  account, follow the instructions
given at  
http://ea.oac.uci.edu/doc/directions.html 
to create your web area.
If you have an  orion.oac.uci.edu  account, follow the instructions
given at  
http://orion.oac.uci.edu/user-help.html 
to create your web area.

  If you move your  hw2done.html  file into your   ~/public_html
 
directory, it will be accessible to the Web as
 http://ea.oac.uci.edu/indiv/vitus/ics1c/ your_login /hw2done.html 
or  http://orion.oac.uci.edu/~ your_login /hw2done.html .
   You can check the validity of the HTML in a Web-accessible
document (such as your  hw2done.html  file if you have moved
it into your   ~/public_html   directory) by using
 
 http://www.uci.edu/tools/validation/  .

  If you have not yet mailed your  hw2done.html  file
