  Creating new Pages 
     New pages are created by simply adding a new  WikiName  to an existing page and clicking on it after saving the existing page.       This brings up a page with a variety of possibilities to create the new page:       click on  create page  to start with an empty page or      click on one of the listed templates to base your page on the content of the selected template.        Below the list of templates you will also find a list of existing pages with a similar name. You should always check this list because someone else might have already started a page about the same subject but named it slightly differently.             For details see  HelpOnPageCreation  and  WikiName .
