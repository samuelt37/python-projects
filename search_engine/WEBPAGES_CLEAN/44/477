  Course Description    

 In many business and industry
application domains handling and processing of digital images is a basic and
important component. This spans an extremely wide range of applications from
digital content creation and management for web-based applications over medical
imaging, digital photography, digital print and publishing to real-time 3D
graphics in simulations and computer games. The widespread use of digital-image
content makes it possible  to effectively communicate 
visual results. This course prepares students in the fundamentals of digital
image processing as used in various applications as outlined above and
illustrates the various effects one can achieve with digital images and how to
extract fundamental information.
