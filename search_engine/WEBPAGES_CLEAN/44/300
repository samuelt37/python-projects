 ICS 184 / EECS 116 Summer 2006 
   Schedule 

 

 

  All assigned readings are from the Silberschatz text.  It is a good idea to skim the assigned reading  before  the lecture for the main ideas, attend lecture, and then to go through the assigned reading again to fill in the details that you missed, both in your initial skim of the reading and in the lecture. 

 Some lectures have little or no reading corresponding to them.  In some cases, this is because a block of reading corresponds to more than one lecture.  In other cases, the material covered in that lecture is not discussed in the textbook.
