   Data Set Information:  
 This dataset includes the recordings of five replicates of an 8-sensor array. Each unit holds 8 MOX sensors and integrates custom-designed electronics for sensor operating temperature control and signal acquisition.  The same experimental protocol was followed to measure the response of the 5 twin units. Each day, a different unit was tested, which included the presentation of 40 different gas conditions, presented in random order. In particular, the unit under test was exposed to 10 concentration levels of Ethanol, Methane, Ethylene, and Carbon Monoxide. The duration of each experiment was 600 s, and the conductivity of each sensor was acquired at 100Hz.  Channel, sensor type (from Figaro), and mean voltage in the heater are as follows:  0: TGS2611 5.65 V 1: TGS2612 5.65 V 2: TGS2610 5.65 V 3: TGS2602 5.65 V 4: TGS2611 5.00 V 5: TGS2612 5.00 V 6: TGS2610 5.00 V 7: TGS2602 5.00 V  Presented concentration levels are as follows (in ppm): Ethylene: 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, 100.0 , 112.5, 125.0 Ethanol: 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, 100.0 , 112.5, 125.0 Carbon Monoxide: 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0 , 125.0 ,150.0, 175.0, 200.0, 225.0 , 250.0 Methane: 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0 , 125.0 ,150.0, 175.0, 200.0, 225.0 , 250.0  Days in which each detection platform was tested. Unit 1: 4,10,15,21 Unit 2: 1,7,11,16 Unit 3: 2,8,14,17 Unit 4: 3,9 Unit 5: 18,22  More information at: J.

   Attribute Information:  
 The responses of the sensors are provided in a .txt file for each experiment. File name codes the unit number, gas (Ea: Ethanol, CO: CO, Ey: Ethylene, Me: Methane), concentration (010-100 of the corresponding gas), and repetition.  For example, B1_GEa_F040_R2.txt indicates B1 (board 1), Ea (Ethanol), 50 ppm, Repetition 2.  Each file includes the elapsed time (in seconds) and the resistance of each sensor (in KOhm). First column is time, and 8 following columns are channels 0-7 as specified before.
