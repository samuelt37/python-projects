  Modifying the MoinMoin Default Style Sheets 
     If you wish to modify the default Moin  Moin style sheet, it is a good practice to create a new theme first. Copy one of the existing themes to a new name (and also do not forget to copy the themename.py file, too). Use the @import function to import the original CSS file. Override only those attributes you wish to change. Then, if you later upgrade to a newer version of Moin  Moin, any changes to the original CSS file will be incorporated automatically.       Example:                     @import url("/wiki/classic/css/screen.css");
  
  body {
      background-color: #FAEBD7;  
      font-family: Arial,Helvetica;  
  }      
  Allowing Users to Choose a Style Sheet 
     To allow you users to choose between alternate style sheets, you first need to create several choices. Using the example above, change the background-color to  #E7FFE7  and save the file as  green.css  in  htdocs/mytheme/css/ .       Test this option by modifying your user preferences to select a  CSS URL</strong> of  /wiki/mytheme/css/green.css .        Finally, you will probably need to edit  HelpOnUserPreferences  and change the wording for  CSS URL</strong> to instruct your users on the choices available, including the new option for a green background.        Note</strong>: When a user initializes or updates their User  Preferences, the default value for  CSS URL</strong> will be empty. Any user can return to the default value by erasing the  CSS URL</strong> field value and clicking the   GetText( Save ) </strong> button.       
  How can I use my old .css style option with the new "theme based" moinmoin? 
      Select the theme you like the most, or is more like your old one.      Clone the selected theme into the wiki plugin directory. For example, if the  classic</strong> theme is your departure point to create  mytheme</strong>, then:        Copy your  htdocs/classic  dir (containing the  css  and  img  subdirs) to  htdocs/mytheme        Copy python/site-packages/Moin  Moin/theme/classic.py to data/plugin/theme/mytheme.py       Add the following line to your  wikiconfig.py :         theme_default = 'mytheme'        Modify the mytheme CSS files (common.css, screen.css and print.css) to change the style and the mytheme.py to change order or appearance of elements in the produced html. At least, make sure that you change the value of the variable  name  to   'mytheme'   (at the top of class  Theme ), otherwise your changes to the mytheme CSS files may have no effect.         In this way, you will already have your personal theme available to simplify new upgrades.
