   Brief Introduction:       

  This is a programming languages paper reading
class. We welcome all students interested in doing research on programming
languages and software systems to join the class. The schedule for this class
is on a per-quarter-basis. For the current (Fall 2013) quarter, we will be
reading and discussing papers on memory models. Please email me if you have a
question.
