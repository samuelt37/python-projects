 The Project 
 The goals of IARPA's Automatic Privacy Protection program are to "develop and demonstrate practical,
sound automated methods for the use of private information retrieval techniques in Intelligence Community systems,
to automatically protect the private data of untargeted individuals, to assure that mandated policies are enforced,
and to enable more effective interagency and intergovernmental data sharing for improved security." 

 The governemnt, through IARPA, is funding four research teams to develop innovative new
techniques for practical private information retrieval (PIR) and one team to develop techniques
for monitoring queries for policy assurance.
