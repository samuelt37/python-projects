| From: "Roy T. Fielding" &lt; fielding@liege.ICS.UCI.EDU &gt;
|
| &gt; 	Now Roy Fielding says that Content-Version is opaque and could
| &gt; 	be used exactly for this purpose, 'cause no one would be the wiser
| &gt; 	if the Content-Version were different for each checkout of the
| &gt; 	same document.  This is true, but now the names of these fields
| &gt; 	are losing their meaning, no?  If it's checkout context, call it
| &gt; 	"Checkout-Context" (or "Checkout-Cookie").
|
| Checkout does not have meaning on all systems, whereas version has a generic
| meaning (at times, too generic). It is intended to be as flexible as possible.
| The "Content-" prefix is a requirement of MIME for what HTTP calls
| entity-header field names.

Not to beat a dead horse (but this one's still kicking):

I'm pushing for us to recognise "checkout" as a meaningful act for the
version abstraction we are trying to support, whether or not the underlying
system can make real use of it.  It means "GET the SOURCE for EDIT".
"GET" because the document has to be fetched (or via existing methods
determined that the user has the requested copy), "the SOURCE" because
the user needs the document as it is prior to any server-side
interpretation, and "for EDIT" so that the VC backend is aware of the
user's activity.

All VC systems can cook up a checkout cookie; some VC system will have
difficulty without one.  The simpler systems - RCS, SCCS, and CVS may
well be wrapped with some layer that provides the context.

Here's how I see them being used, again with Perforce thrown into the
mix because it has fairly modern VC semantics:

		CHECKOUT		LOCK			CHECKIN

RCS		Probably just		Verifies that		Verifies

		be different that what
		was requested.

Perforce	Emits client pathname	Verifies that		Verfies

		being checked out.	checked out file.	represents
								head rev.

There is use for the checkout cookie for all these systems, even if the
cookied degrades into being little more than "Content-Version".  Since
All VC systems can make use of the cookies, and some need them for sane
operation (checkin without checkout under clearcase is a no-go), it makes
sense to use a single tag across all underlying VC systems.

IMHO, of course.
