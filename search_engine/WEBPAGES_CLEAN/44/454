We study iterative randomized greedy algorithms for generating
(elimination) orderings with small induced width and
state space size - two parameters known to bound the complexity
of inference in graphical models. We propose and implement
the Iterative Greedy Variable Ordering (IGVO) algorithm,
a new variant within this algorithm class. An empirical
evaluation using different ranking functions and conditions of
randomness, demonstrates that IGVO finds significantly better
orderings than standard greedy ordering implementations
when evaluated within an anytime framework. Additional order
of magnitude improvements are demonstrated on a multicore
system, thus further expanding the set of solvable graphical models.
The experiments also confirm the superiority of
the MinFill heuristic within the iterative scheme.
