                                 Thursday, January 23rd WICS took a trip to Blizzard for a tour of their campus!  We had the privilege of seeing the World of Warcraft developer space and were able to see the kind of work Blizzard developers do first hand.  We were surprised by the colorful offices full of toys and gaming memorabilia, which seems like a rare environment compared to most software development spaces. Thank you to Blizzard for offering their time and space for our organization! 
 After the tour, WICS took a group picture in front of the statue on the Blizzard campus as seen below!
