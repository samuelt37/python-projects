 Relative Worst Order Analysis 

 Joan Boyar 

 Abstract: 
This talk will provide an introduction to relative
worst order analysis, a method for comparing the
performance of on-line algorithms. On-line bin packing
and paging will be used as examples.
 
The papers providing the basis for this talk are joint
work with Lene M. Favrholdt and Kim S. Larsen.
