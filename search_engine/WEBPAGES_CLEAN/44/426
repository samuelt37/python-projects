Showed that for various optimization criteria, the
optimal polygon containing  k  of  n 
points must be near one of the points, hence one can transform
time bounds involving several factors of  n 
to bounds linear in  n  but polynomial in  k. 
Used as a subroutine are data structures for finding several
 nearest neighbors  in rectilinear metric spaces, and
algorithms for finding the
 deepest point in an arrangement  of cubes or
spheres.
