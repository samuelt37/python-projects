                       Econ 11 / ICS 11 Course Policies   
                            
               
           
             Problem Sets:  
                  There will be five problem sets during the term. See the course outline for tentative assignment dates. All problem sets will be posted on the course web page.   
                    Problem sets  are usually due on Tuesday the week after they are assigned. They   are due at the beginning of class, and must be turned in either in lecture or to   the instructor's mailbox in 3019 Bren Hall.
                    No late homework will be accepted.   
                    Some problems on the problem set will be graded based on effort, but not on   the correctness of the answer. Other problems will be graded based both on   effort and on the knowledge demonstrated. It will not be announced beforehand   which problems fall into which category.   
                    Graded problem sets will normally be returned one week after the due date.   Solutions will be available online   when the problem sets are returned.   
                    Your lowest problem set score will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
                                      Case Studies:  
                  There will be three case studies during the term. See the case study webpage for details. 
                   Case studies will be done in groups of 4 or 5 students. 
                   Groups will be formed on Monday of the third week of the quarter. 
                   Each group will act as a Lobbyist for one case study, and as a Staffer for another case study. 
                   In addition, each student will act as a Reporter for the remaining case study. 
                   Grading Policy:  
                Letter grades are based on the instructor's   evaluation of your demonstrated performance in the course. An overall score in   the course will be calculated using the following weighting:
                  Problem Sets (20%)  Case study Lobbyist presentation and report (20%)
                    Case study Staffer presentation  (20%)
                    Case study Reporter (5%)
                    Participation (5%)
                    Final (30%)
                   No absolute scale will be used in assigning letter grades to each overall   score. Instead, the instructor will use his judgment to decide what letter grade   is appropriate for each overall score range. The instructor reserves the right   to override this policy in individual cases where the student has demonstrated   mastery of the material on the final, but this is rare. 
                 All grades (problem sets, case studies, final) will be   available through eee.uci.edu.

                      Policy on Academic Honesty:  
                   UCI   Policy on Academic Integrity.  This includes a definition of plagiarism.
                    On problem sets, you are strongly encouraged to work in groups to discuss   your  approach  to solving each problem, but you must work individually in   progressing from that point toward the solution. You must turn in  only  your own work. Use of any solutions from any source other than a student's own   work is considered plagiarism. 
                   On case studies, the work presented is expected to represent the participation of all members of the group. Anything that is other than the group's own   work must be properly cited or it is considered plagiarism. 
                   Students agree that by taking this   course all required papers are subject to submission for textual similarity   review to Turnitin.com for the detection of plagiarism.  All submitted papers   will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database   solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of the   Turnitin.com service is subject to the Usage Policy agreement posted on the   Turnitin.com site.  
                     Add Drop Policy:  
                  Adds: Only allowed through the end of week 1, as space permits.
                    Drops: Only allowed through the end of week 2.
                    Attendance Policy:  
                  Attendance at all case studies is expected. Students are responsible for all material covered in all lectures, and the   instructor will not provide notes. Posted lecture slides will be missing some key material. Participation in case studies is a significant part of the course grade.
                    To be respectful to your classmates, please turn off cell phones when in the   classroom, and avoid discussion that is not part of classroom activity.
