 ICS-21 Overview 
 
  Introduction to Computer Science I 
ICS-21 
Spring 2012
 
 
  




 
       Introduction  
 
This lecture will overview four topics related to this course:
  Learning: what material will we cover in ICS-21
    Computing/Human Resources:  what resources are available
        (and how we will learn to use them).
    Perspectives on Programming: a short discussion of programming and
        education built around 
         Quotes 
        that I have collected on my web page (there are hundreds there)
    Software Production: This is some "big picture" material that I lecture
        my introductory programming students on.
      Especially interesting is the table on
       Software Project Metrics 
  
This lecture, like the ones to follow, has a problem set at the end.
But instead of doing these problems with the reading -because this
  is the first day of class- we will spend time in class looking at and
   solving these problems.
They mostly concern the precise use of a natural language: there are many
  parallels here to the precise use of a programming langauge.
 
    
  Course Goals 



       
   A First Course in Programming  
 
First and most importantly, ICS-21 assumes  no knowledge of programming .
But, it does assume some knowledge of using computers and software and the
  course moves quickly.
If you  have never used the Windows in some form (XP, Windows 7, etc.), Mac
  OS X, Linux operating systems, we will briefly discuss everything that you
  need to know about them -but you might have to spend some extra time during
  the first week of the course studying and learning this material.
Do not get behind on this count.
 
ICS-21 introduces the concepts and skills needed to begin serious programming.
It is taught in the  Java  language: although this language is harder to
  learn than many, it is an industrial strength language with a large library
  that you can spend years exploring and mastering.
Some of its more advanced features are covered in ICS-22/-23 -the follow-on
  courses to this one; some Java features are beyond the scope of even these
  more advanced courses.
  
During ICS-21 we will cover a wide variety of introductory and intermediate
  Java language features
Below I've tried to categorize the fundamentals of programming in Java
What I think should be covered in ICS-21 includes:
   how to read EBNF descriptions of Java's syntax,
  how to parse Java programs into tokens
    (identifiers, keywords, operators, delimiters, literals, comments),
  how to declare and picture variables (both primitive and references;
      the meaning of  final  for variables),
  how to classify and understand operators
      (terminology; arithmetic, relational, logical, textual, state-change;
       implicit conversion)
  how to analyze and synthesize expressions
    (precedence and associativity, short-circuit evaluation),
  how to analyze and synthesize statements
    (including expression statements,  if ,
     while ,  do ,  for ,  break ,
     switch , and the basics of  try/catch  and exception
    handling); how to analyze statements via hand-simulation and the debugger.
  how to read Javadoc (constructors, methods, and fields; the meaning of
    access modifiers:  final ,  static ,
      public ,  private ) and use pre-written Java
     classes ( Math ,  Prompt ,
      DiceEnsemble ,  BigInteger ,  Timer ,
      ModularCounter ,  StringTokenizer ,
      TypedBufferReader , and  TypedBufferWriter ), understanding
     the difference between local variables, parameter variables, and instance
     variables.  
  how to write your own classes (constructors, methods, and fields from the
    inside),
  how to declare and manipulate Java arrays (of one dimension), including
  how to use them to write classes storing simple collections,
  how to use Java interfaces,
  how to construct, test, and debug programs systematically
  

Basically you will learn the core of programming and Java; we hope that if you
  need to learn more, you will have the necessary skills to learn more advanced
  programming and Java, whether you learn it by yourself or take more courses.
 
Likewise, we will learn to use the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment
  (IDE), including its compiler, debugger, and browser.
Finally, we will cover a variety of  skill in programming  material:
  topics such as program composition, analysis, testing, debugging,
  simplification, and style.
Students will work on six programming assignments based on this material;
  each involves writing a few "small" programs, exercising combinations of
  the material being covered.
During this time we will learn how to program and test our code incrementally,
  and understand the debugging leverage that we get from doing so (as well
  as formally studying the Eclipse debugger).
  
We will cover this material rigorously.
I believe that even students with some background in Java will learn lots
  of little details (and maybe a few big ones) that we will exploit and build
  on as we cover new material later in the quarter.
Do not get behind during the initial phase of this course; everything builds
  on it (especially the terminology); and if you know the early material,
  make sure you start paying attention when we get to the material you don't
  know.
  
  
    




        Expectations for Learning  
 
As members of a course, working together in teaching and learning, we should
  share the following expectations.

   
  
 Instructor: 
   Starts and stops class on time.
    Assigns the minimal amount of homework, but enough so that students learn
        all the required material and are comfortable with it.
         ICS-21 is a 6 unit course.
            A full-time student typical takes ~15 units/quarter.
            Assuming a 40 hour (full-time) work week, this means your time
              working on ICS-21 should occupy about 16 hours/week.
            Of this 16 hours, 7 hours/week will be in-class lecture/lab time,
              leaving 9 hours/week for lecture prepartion and programming.
           Distributes course materials in a timely manner.
    Returns solutions/graded homework promptly.
    Is available for providing individual help.
   Student: 
  Attends class, is punctual, and participates (does reading, asks/answer
        questions).
    Completes all homework, spending the requisite time to learn all the
         required material.
    Studies course materials (READ! READ! READ!) and is prepared for class.
    Examines solutions/graded homework to improve knowledge and rectify
        misconceptions about the course material (and promptly reports any
        possible grading mistakes).
    Seeks individual help when it is needed.
  
The biggest source of problems for students taking ICS-21 is skipping classes,
  not doing readings/homework fully, and poor time management on programming
  assignments (waiting too long to start them).
You are scheduled to spend about 160 hours in ICS-21 (10 weeks of work at 16
  hours/week); please allow for this much time in your schedule, and use this
  time wisely.
 
I believe that with the right attitude and work ethic, any UCI student can
  learn (and demonstrate that he/she has learned) the material required for
  ICS-21, and pass this course with a good grade.
But it does take a desire and action on your part.

  
    



 
  Resources 




         Computer Labs and Software  
 
I expect that most students will be using their own computers for programming
  assignments.
You are encouraged to use your own machine for all aspects of the course that
  it is capable of supporting.
You can download all the required course software to your personal computer for
  free.
 
In addition to using their own machines, students can do their coursework on
  the machines in the  ICS Labs .
The main upside of using the ICS labs is that it will be easy to get ICS-21
  staff to help you there; the main downside is that you will not be using
  your own computer -unless you have a portable and bring it to the labs to
  get the best of both worlds.
All labs are located in in the ICS building, in rooms 180, 189, 192, and 364.
  
ICS courses often schedule lab hours (to complement lecture hours), during
  which students can learn how to use software tools and work on their
  programming assignments, all under the supervision of ICS-21 staff members.
We will have 4 hours of lab scheduled each week.
  
The machines in the ICS Labs are Dell Optiplex computers running Windows XP
  and all the necessary course software: browsers, the Eclipse Integrated
  Development Environment (IDE), Java, and all the other course-related
  software.
These labs provide a convenient space for students to work on their assignments
  where the course staff is available to answer questions immediately.
  
Debugging help will also be available via instant messaging (IM) and realVNC
  (screen-/keyboard-/mouse-mapping software): students will be able to locate 
  staff online, describe/show their code to them, ask them questions about
  their code, and even have the staff manipulate the code directly on the
  student's computer (to run tests on it while helping to correct it).
  
    




        The World Wide Web (WWW)  
 
I will place all materials for this course on the WWW: some are there
  now, others will become available later in the quarter.
You will also use the web for submitting programs for grading.
These materials are organized using the following index on the course
  home page.
   
Here is a brief description of these main entries
   Fact Sheet : A short page providing information about course staff,
         getting help, and meeting times; this is the default page for the
         course.
     Announcements : A page with messages to the students (updated
         almost daily, archived with the most current message at the top).
     Email Archive : A page with all messages mailed to the
         email discussion group for this class.
     Syllabus : A long page providing detailed information about how
         the course is run (print a copy and read it).
   
      Lecture Schedule/Notes : A page indexing all lectures and labs,
         their on-line lecture notes, and their associated problem sets.
     Programming Assignments : A page indexing all programming
         assignments.
     Weekly Schedule : A page listing all readings and homework
         assignments (and their due dates), week by week.
     Help Schedule : A page listing all the times help is available to
         students, both inside and outside of class.
   
      Handouts (General) : A page indexing a variety of handouts related
         to the course.
     Online Resources : A page indexing various useful on-line files
         (some meant to be viewed, some meant to be downloaded).
     Sample Programs : A page indexing various programs students can
         download, examine, and run.
   
      Javadoc of Sun's API : Documentation of Sun's standard Java
         classes.
     Javadoc of JUnit 4.7 : Documentation of the JUnit classes.
     Javadoc of Courses API : Documentation of the ICS-21's standard
         Java classes.
     Javadoc of Collections API : Documentation of ICS-23 Collection
           classes.
   
      Java Language Reference : Documentation of the Java Language; see
         the (table of) contents for details (meant to be read by those
         knowledgeable about programming: not an introduction!)
   
      Solutions : A page indexing my solutions to all course assignments
         (quizzes, exams, and programs); updated as appropriate
     Grades : A zipped file you can download with all course grades
         (typically indexed by the last 5 digits of your UCI ID).
   
      Anonymous Email : A page students can use to send the instructor
         anonymous email (when personal email might be awkward).
     Homework Dropoff : A page students use to drop off homework (mostly
         weekly programming assignments and in-class programming exams;
         sometimes programming parts of quizzes).
   
      Search ICS-21 : Do a "google" search of the course web pages.
     Search Javadoc 1.6 API : Do a "google" search of the Java API.
    
During this course you will be constantly reading web pages, and sometimes
  downloading materials from them onto your computer.
Generally, it is critical to become an expert navigating the course web with a
  browser; specifically you should become familiar with the pages used 
  repeated in this course (so that you can easily find all the materials you
  need).
 
If you run across any "missing links", please drop me a short e-mail so that I
  can correct them quickly.
  
    




        Human Resources  
 
Students start ICS-21 with a wide variety of aptitudes and skills. 
At times, even the best students run into problems, misconceptions, mental
  roadblocks, etc.
It is imperative that you quickly determine that you have a problem, and then
  get it diagnosed and corrected as soon as possible.
There are many different resources that you can elect to use:
   Instructor : From my perspective, the best place to get help is
           from me.
         For simple problems, a short e-mail, phone call, or IM might suffice.
         For more complicated problems, I have office hours daily.
         These are open office hours: no appointment is necessary.
         I also attend labs.
         If you cannot see me during any of these times, please contact me 
           (by e-mail or by phone) to schedule a special appointment.
     TAs : The Teaching Assistants will be in lecture/lab daily.

         They will also offer consulting sessions online
           (via IM and realVNC) and in the ICS labs, during some non-class
           hours (afternoons, evenings, weekends).
         Your TA is responsible for grading your programs, so they the first
            person you should see if you have any questions about how your
            programming assignments were graded.

     Lab Tutors : Lab Tutors will be in lab daily.
         They will also offer consulting sessions online (via IM and realVNC)
           and in the ICS labs, during some non-class hours.
     Students : I encourage students in my courses to seek out each
           other if they have questions.
         The student answering the question will benefit as much as the student
            asking it.
         One beneficial reason to come to UCI is for the interaction with other
           outstanding students.
      Of course, for graded materials there a dos and don'ts relating to
        academic integrity.  
  
The most useful online mechanism for handing questions/discussions is EEE's
  
 Forums on MessageBoard 
These forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as
  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).
Initially, I have created four forums for ICS-21:
  Java and Eclipse
  Lecture Material
  Programming Assignments
  Quizzes and Exams
  
If the need arises for other forums (tell me if you think another would be
  useful), I will create them.
You can instruct EEE to email you links to any active discussions in the
  forums.
In past quarters, these forums have seen a tremendous amount of traffic: course
  material has been clarified, questions have been asked and answered, and many
  interesting side-discussions have ensued.
But the efficacy depends on your participation.
 
I will broadcast information to all the students (and staff) in ICS-21
  using the   &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 
  ICS-21 Email List 
  (ics21-S12@classes.uci.edu)   
All students and staff in the course will automatically receive emails sent to
  this address and all messages sent via this discussion list will be archived
  on the
   
  Email Archive  web page.
Mostly student-initialied questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned
  above, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the
  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g.,
  Checkmate not responding to program submissions.
 
Learning when and how to seek help from others is an important skill to acquire
  -one that you will use continually in your professional career.
For example, if you encounter a programming problem that you cannot solve in 5
  minutes (and see no further steps toward a solution), you should be able to
  explain the problem concisely (using all the programming terminology that you
  have learned) to someone else, and then understand and apply an informed
  answer, possibly collaborating to reach a solution.
  
Instructors, TAs, and Lab Tutors all have experience handling such questions,
  and are trained to help students learn to become more self-sufficient
  -while still answering their questions: for example, we might tell you a
  general technique for solving a collection of similar problems instead of 
 just telling you "the answer".
Sometimes this process is a bit frustrating for students seeking help
  (especially if they started the assignment late and are caught in a
  time-bind), but ultimately this approach makes them better programmers.
The appropriate homily is,  "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a
  day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for life." 
  
Think seriously about using the human resources that UCI provides (which
  includes me, our TAs, and Lab Tutors, and your fellow
  students), just as you would think about using computational resources:
  the former resources are even more important than the latter.
  
 Knowing when (and how) to seek help is a strength, not a weakness. 
  
          A Bit about Me    
 
I hope to get to know you all individually during the quarter.
Here is some information about me.
 
I grew up on the North Shore of Chicago (in the town of Wilmette) and attended
   New Trier West High School.
I was an undergraduate Mathematics major at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
  from 1972-1975, after which I taught a introductory programming there for a
  year.
I went to graduate school in Computer Science at Stanford.
While there, I wrote a book,  Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the
  Art of Programming , and its associated software (since updated by Mark
  Stehlik and Jim Roberts at CMU).
Over the years, my book has been revised and extended by Joe Bergin to C++,
  Java, and now Python, and it is still used in Colleges and High Schools
  around the world.
  
From 1985-1995 I taught introductory and intermediate programming at the
  University of Washington in Seattle (sending lots of my students to work
  at Microsoft; the times allowed many of them to become millionaires).
From 1996-2007 I returned to teach at CMU; for the last two years there,
  I served as the Freshman Advisor for incomming Freshman in Computer
  Science (about 150/year)
In 2007, I joined the Bren School of Information and Computer Science (with
  a joint appointment in Computer Science and Informatics), returning to teach
  in a public university (where my wife is heading the new Nursing program).
  
During my Freshman year in high school, I had a Math teacher named Mr. Lill.
One class, during a test, my mechanical pencil broke.
I asked Mr. Lill to borrow one of his pencils; but he said no.
I asked him whether I could borrow a friend's pencil; but he said no to that
  too.
He told me to always come prepared to class, and sat me back down at my desk
  (where I failed the test because I was unable to write any answers).
I had a very low opinion of Mr. Lill for a long time -for years, and I thought
  about this incident for many years; but he taught me an important lesson that
  stayed with me much longer than the mathematics he taught.
I hope I don't have to be anyone's "Mr. Lill", but I will assume that roll if
  necessary: there are lots of lessons to be taught at UCI and not all of them
  concern the content of the course material.
  
I have posted this story on my course web pages for many many years.
Amazingly, in 2009, when I was attending a reception for students
  admitted to ICS at UCI, I started talking with a student and his parents.
Offhandedly I asked where the father grew up; it was near me; I asked what
  high school he went to; it was mine; I asked what year he started; it was
  the same year that I started!
At that point we exchanged names, and recognized each other: we were not
  close friends in High School and had not seen each other since graduation.
The absolute first comment he made to me was, "Do you remember the day in Mr.
  Lill's class when he wouldn't let you borrow the pencil."
I was totally floored.
Obviously the lesson that I learned so painfully that day was also learned by
  many others, but at a lesser cost.
  
As a senior in High School I wanted to take both AP Chemistry and AP Physics,
  but they were scheduled at the same time.
I had great respect for and enjoyed being in the classroom with the Chemistry
  teacher, Mr. Kunz, so I signed up for AP Chemistry.
I asked the AP Physics teacher for a list of all the problems that he assigned
  from the textbook, and spent the year reading the book and working those
  problems (the book had answers -but not worked solutions- for many of those
  problem in the back).
The result was that I discovered that I could learn myself, from what are now
  considered very rudimentary learning materials.
A big goal of college is to teach students to be able to learn by themselves.
  
          Student Feedback  
 
The most interesting short comment that I received on a Faculty/Course
  Evaluation form (FCE) was, "You teach  a biased class."
After some reflection, I had to agree with that student 100%.
Almost everything I do in my class is highly biased: choosing which programming
  topics to teach, how to sequence these topics (which ones to emphasize, which
  ones to relegate as mere details), deciding programming assignments and test
  questions (and how to award credit for these problems), etc.
You are sitting in my classroom because you have decided to obtain the UCI
  bias on how to learn programming.
 
I once read a book written about MIT.
The author observed that everyone there majored in the same thing: MIT.
Yes, they all learned a different vocabulary and facts, and practiced reasoning
   and problem solving in different disciplines, but what everyone really was
   doing there was learning to think like an MIT graduate.
Along these lines, I want you to eventually acquire a Pattis simulator in
  your head.
By running it, you can determine how I would approach a problem; how I would
  critique a solution, etc.
You don't have to agree with the results it produces, but it is there for
  you to consult.
  
The most interesting long comment I received on a course evaluation form was
labeled  A Relevant Allegory :
  
 
  "In order to teach someone to boil water, he would first spend a day giving
     the history of pots, including size, shape, and what metals work best.
   The next day he'd lecture on the chemical properties of water.
   On day three, he'd talk about boiled water through the ages.
   That night, he'd tell people to go home and use boiled water to make
     spaghetti carbonera.
   But never once would he tell you to put the water in the pot and heat it.
   That's what his programming classes are like -completely irrelevant to the
     task at hand."
 
     
I like this comment because it is witty, well-written, and true -although
  maybe not in the extreme that the author states.
Teaching students to boil water is great for a high school class, but
  in college we are trying to achieve something deeper: we might, instead,
  study phase transitions in matter.
That is, we don't just learn particulars (drill and practice); we learn
  general theories and -in spite of what this student says- how to apply
  them to particular cases.
I want to teach programming in such a way that when students are exposed to
  new and novel situations, they will be able to use their general knowledge
  to fall back and analyze the problem, figure out what they know and what
  they need to learn to solve the problem, and ultimately synthesize a
  solution.
I acknowledge that learning from first principles is tougher than memorization,
  and that sometimes students feel that the material covered is not "applied".
But, I believe that everything that I teach has many concrete applications.
  
    
  Learning a Programming Language 




        Learning  
 
In this section I'd like to work from the general to the specific,
  from education to programming, illustrated with various
   
    Quotes 
  I have collected on my web page.
Let's start with three interesting quotes: the first from a graduate student
  at the University of Washington, and the second from Jacob Bronowski, a
  distinguished philosopher of science, the third from Edward Teller, a
  physicist.
 
    
There is a division in the student population between those who go to college
  to learn and those who go to college to earn a diploma. 
  - J. Blau (letter to the editor, Chronicle of Higher Education, May 24, 2002) 
  
     
It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverance
  to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to
  question it.
  - J. Bronowski 
  
     
I believe in excellence.
It is a basic need of every human soul.
All of us can be excellent, because, fortunately, we are exceedingly diverse
  in our ambitions and talents. 
  - E. Teller 
     
You have to decide why you are attending UCI.
Your choice will have a lot to say about what you do in this class and others.
Here is a simple question that makes it concrete:
  which of the following students would you rather be?
Student 1 attends UCI, but on graduation day is informed that all records of
  the student's performance at UCI have been lost; in the future, UCI will
  acknowledge only that the student attended for four years and graduated
  with a CS degree, but there are no more details to tell.
Student 2 attends UCI, but on graduation day is hit on the head and develops
  amnesia; although UCI shows the student to have graduated with a 4.0 in CS,
  the student cannot remember any of the material learned through those four
  years.
  
I enjoy teaching because I am constantly challenged by students to think more
  deeply about what I know and how I can teach it.
Teaching as best I can is my job; challenging what you hear -to better
   understand it and question my knowledge of the subject- is yours.
Such challenges make me rethink and revise my opinions (more than you might
  imagine) and think about better ways of presenting and explaining
  complicated material.
  
Everyone can excel in Computer Science at UCI: different students will
  gravitate torwards different parts of the field, but it is a big field -with
  many connections to applications in other disciplines- and there is room for
  everyone to be excellent at something.
Many of you will be excellent at programming; some of you will be good at it,
  and that will be enough for you.
But, everyone should acquire a basic understanding and basic skills in
  programming.
  
Just as I question myself, a huge part of learning requires students to
  question themselves (and, as seen above, me as well).
Learning is more about questions than answers, as the following quotes
  illustrate.
  
    
Good teaching is more a giving of the right questions than a giving of the
   right answers.
  - J. Albers 
  
A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.
   - F. Bacon 
  
Questions are the important thing, answers are less important.
Learning to ask a good question is the heart of intelligence.
Learning the answer---well, answers are for students.
Questions are for thinkers. 
   - R. Schank (in "The Connosseur's Guide to the Mind") 
  
The function of genius is not to give new answers, but to pose new questions
   which time and mediocrity can resolve. 
   - H. Trevor-Howard 
  
     
When the physics nobel-laureate I. Rabi was a child, his mother would
  always ask him at the dinner table not what he learned in his classes that
  day, but what interesting questions he asked.
  
Neil Postman, a famous education, technology, and media critic tells the
  following story about the importance of asking the right question:
  
Two priests were arguing about whether it was appropriate to pray and
  smoke at the same time.
They each resolved to ask their bishop for guidance.
When they met again, each claimed that the bishop supported his position!
They went on to explore their interactions with the bishop in a bit more
  detail.
The first said, "I asked the bishop whether it was appropriate to smoke while
  praying, and he said that praying is a transcendant activity that should not
  be debased by smoking."
The second said, "I asked the bishop whether it was appropriate to pray while
  smoking, and he said that praying was appropriate any time."
 
I know that some students enrolled in this course have already learned some
  programming, and that the first few weeks of the quarter might be a review
  for them.
I urge them to use this time to attain a deeper, more integrated understanding
  of this material, as the following quote illustrates.
 
    
The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new
  eyes.
  - M. Proust 
     
Remember too, that teaching and learning are two different, but cooperative
  activities.
I'll do my best to teach, but you need to do your best to learn as well.
  
    
We think too much about effective methods of teaching and not enough about
  effective methods of learning.
No matter how good teaching may be, each student must take the responsibility
  for his own education. 
  - J. Carolus S.J. 
  
Learning results from what the student does and thinks, and only from what
  the student does and thinks.
The teacher can advance learning only by influencing the student to learn.
   - H. Simon 
  
The truth is, when all is said and done, one does not  teach a subject ,
  one teaches a student how to learn it.
Teaching may look like administering a dose, but even a dose must be worked
  on by the body if it is to cure.
Each individual must cure his or her own ignorance.
   - J. Barzun ("Begin Here", pp 35),  
  
I have learned throughout my life as a composer chiefly through my mistakes
  and pursuits of false assumptions, not my exposure to founts of wisdom and
  knowledge. 
   - I. Stravinsky 
     
Here is an old joke that illustrates this idea:
  
One day a mother comes home from work and asks her son, "What did you do
  today?"
The son replied, "I taught our dog how to play the piano."
The mother, incredulous, asked, "Our dog can play the piano?", to which the
  son laughed and replied, "Of course not mom. I said that I taught him; I
  didn't say that he learned how." 
 
Finally, don't be afraid to "struggle" and "fail"; if learning were
  simple and effortless, we'd all be a lot smarter.
 
    
I, myself, have had many failures and I've learned that if you are not failing
  a lot, you are probably not being as creative as you could be -you aren't
  stretching your imagination. 
  - J. Backus (primary inventor of FORTRAN) 
  
Learning is never done without errors and defeat. 
   - V. Lenin 
  
You have to honor failure, because failure is just the negative space around
  success. 
   - R. Nelson (in Wired 06/2004 page 166) 
     

Unfortunately, the K-12 educational world that we live in doesn't encourages
  students to try (at really hard things) and fail.
Everyone wants to make sure they never fail.
This attitude is bad in many dimensions.
College is a safe place to try hard and fail (and succeed eventually too).
  
          Language  
 
Let's leave learning behind (but not for too long!) and talk a bit
  about language.
This course is meta-lingual: we will use a language (English) to learn a
  language (Java).
Some argue, as illustrated below, that language is what reality (and
  certainly education) is primarily about: independent of the subject
  material, thoughts are linguistic.
 
As a concrete example, we will learn lots of technical terms during the
 first few weeks of the course, and then use them repeated as levers to
  explore and describe advanced Java concepts.
When it comes time to ask questions about the material, or questions about
  debugging a program that you are writing, knowing how to ask using these
   technical terms -and understand the answers given in these technical terms-
   makes the process more precise and concise.
In an important sense, this course is concerned not only about
  doing programming, but just as much with how to talk about programs and 
  doing programming.
  
    
That language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted. 
  - G. Boole 
  
The real technology -behind all our other technologies- is language.
It actually creates the world our consciousness lives in.
   - A. Codrescu 
  
It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is.
Physics concerns what we say about nature.
   - N. Bohr 
  
Precise language is not the problem. Clear language is the problem.
   - R. Feynman 
  
We think only through the medium of words.
Languages are true analytical methods.
Algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression, in
  the most simple, most exact, and best manner possible, is at the same time
  a language and an analytical method.
The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged. 
   - A. Lavoisier 
  
Knowledge of a subject means knowledge of the language of that subject, which
 includes not only what its words mean, but far more important, how its
 words mean.
As one learns the language of a subject, one is also learning what the subject
  is.
It cannot be said often enough that what we call a subject consists mostly,
  if not entirely, of its language. If you eliminate all the words of a
  subject, you have eliminated the subject.
Biology is not plants and animals.
It is language about plants and animals.
History is not events.
It is language describing and interpreting events.
Astronomy is not planets and stars. It is a way of talking about planets and
  stars.
   - N. Postman 
  
Language serves not only to express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist without it. 
   - B. Russell 
  
The limits of your language are the limits of your world. 
   - L. Wittgenstein  
     
          Programming  
 
Finally, let's talk about programming and programming languages.
Most of the quotes below are lengthy, and come from emminent computer
  scientists (or just fantastic programmers) who are trying to communicate
  what programming is about and why it is so fascinating to them.
 
    
The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
  thought-stuff.
He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the
  imagination.
Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so
  readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that
  it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct
  itself.
It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.
The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.
One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to
  life, showing things that never were nor could be. ...
The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too.
If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper
  form, the magic doesn't work.
Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human
  activity demand it.
Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult
  part of learning to program. 
  - F. Brooks ("The Mythical Man Month", pages 7-8) 
  
It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an
  engineer and an artist.
There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because
  you have to do very precise thinking.
On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of
  imagination are the only real limitation. 
   - A. Hertzfeld (original Mac programmer) 
  
When I speak about computer programming as an art, I am thinking primarily of
  it as an art form, in an aesthetic sense.
The chief goal of my work as an educator and author is to help people learn
  how to write beautiful programs ... 
My feeling is that when we prepare a program, the experience can be just like
  composing poetry or music ...
Some programs are elegant, some are exquisite, some are sparkling.
My claim is that it is possible to write grand programs, noble programs, truly
  magnificent ones!  ...  computer programming is an art, because it applies
  accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity,
  and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they 
 do and will do it better. 
   - D. Knuth (Computer Programming as an Art. Turing Award Speech 1974) 
  
A good programming language is a conceptual universe for thinking about
  programming. 
A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not
  worth knowing. 
   - A. Perlis 
  
A programming language is a system of notation for describing computations.
A useful programming language must therefore be suited for both description
 (i.e., for human writers and readers of programs) and for computation
 (i.e., for efficient implementation on computers).
But human beings and computers are so different that it is difficult to find
  notational devices that are well suited to the capabilities of both. 
   - R. Tennant (Principles of Programming Languages, Prentice Hall, 1981) 
     
Now, I like to focus on aesthetics, because at some level, the
  root of learning in all disciplines is learning their aesthetics:
  learning to separate the beautiful from the ugly.
Central to this discussion is the dichotomy between complexity and 
 simplicity in programming.
As is illustrated many times below, what makes programming hard is
  complexity in the tools used and complexity of the final product: it is
  too easy to create overly complicated designs and implementations (which
  inevitably are incorrect).
We must strive to keep everything simple: this is where creativity in
   programming lies.
Programming is one of many human activities in which simplicity and beauty
  are bound tightly.
  
    
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
  own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility,
  and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. 
  - E. Dijkstra (in "The Humble Programmer",
   his 1972 Turing Award Lecture) 
  
Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because
  software is so complicated.
Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity.
...
The geniuses of the computer field, on the the other hand, are the
  people with the keenest aesthetic senses, the ones who are 
  capable of creating beauty.
Beauty is decisive at every level: the most important interfaces, the most
  important programming languages, the winning algorithms are the beautiful
  ones.
...
Good programmers know what is beautiful and bad programmers don't.
   - D. Gelernter ("Machine Beauty", Basic Books, 1998) 
  
Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty.
If you look inside good software, you find that parts that no one is ever
  supposed to see are beautiful too.
When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for
  prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way.
It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly
  variable names.
   - P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 29) 
  
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. 
   - B. Kernighan (creator of the C programming language) 
  
Fools ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; experts avoid it; geniuses
  remove it. ...
Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
   - A. Perlis 
  
Computer Science is the first engineering discipline in which the complexity of
  the objects created is limited solely by the skill of  the creator, and not
  by the strength of raw materials.
   - B. Reid 
  
Design and programming are human activities; forget that and all is lost. 
   - B. Stroustrup 
  
Technical skill is mastery of complexity, while creativity is mastery of
  simplicity.
   - E. C. Zeeman 
     
I'd like to present the following quote last; it will provide an import
  perpective for many of our discussions about features in the Java
  language and the strictness of the Java compiler.
It fully recognizes the psychological aspect of programming and is directly
  related to the complexity of the tools that we use when we build complex
  artifacts.
  
    
Millions for compilers, but hardly a penny for understanding human programming
  language use.
Now, programming languages are obviously symmetrical, the computer on one
  side, the human on the other.
In an appropriate science of computer languages, one would expect that half
  the effort would be on the computer side, understanding how to translate
  the languages into executable form, and half on the human side, understanding
  how to design languages that are easy or productive to use.
Yet, we do not even have an enumeration of all the psychologicial functions
  programing languages serve for the user.
Of course, there is lots of programming language  design , but it comes
  from computer scientists.
And though technical papers on languages contain mainly appeals to ease of use
  and learning, they patently contain almost no psychologicial evidence nor any
  appeal to psychological science.
  - A. Newell and S. Card 
     
    
  Software 




        System Costs  
 
In the early days, computers were built by hand, which made them expensive.
They were physcially large, consumed huge amount of power, were slow, and their
  memories were small; so they could run only small programs.
As a result, the cost of developing a working computing system was mostly spent
  on hardware.
 
At present, computers are cheaply mass produced: they are small, consume
  minimal power, are fast, and have large memories.
Now, the cost of developing a working computing system is mostly spent on
  software.
To deliver new systems cheaply and on time, we must focus on improving the
 production of software.
When implementing a computer system, a 5% improvement in developing software
  is worth about as much as a 50% improvement in developing hardware (because
  these latter costs are so minimal to start with).
  
    
   
      
 
In his Turing Award lecture, "The Humble Programmer", Edgser Dijkstra (a famous
  Computer Scientist) put it as follows: 
"As long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all;
 when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem,
 and now [1972] that we have gigantic computers, programming has become a
 gigantic problem.

 ...As the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a
 thousand, society's ambition to apply these new machines grew in proportion,
 and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of
 tension between the ends and the means.
 
  The increased power of the hardware, together with the perhaps more dramatic
  increase in its reliability, made solutions feasible that the programmer had
  not dared to dream about a few years before.

  And now, a few years later, he  had  to dream about them and even worse,
  he had to transform such dreams into reality! It is no wonder that we found
  ourselves in a software crisis."
   
In fact,
   Moore's "Law"  
 (empirical) states that computer/communication hardware doubles
 in performance (speed, memory) and halves in resources (size, cost) about
  every 18 months.
This exponential law has held for the past 30 years of computing, which has
  seen changes in computing technology by a factor of a million.
PCs today perform a billion operations per second; if Moore's Law continues to
  hold for another 40 years, PCs will be performing a thousand trillion
  operations per second (about as many as the human brain performs; with many
  more logical elements, each operating at a much slower -than electronic-
  speed).
      




        A Software Development Model  
 
Over the last 30 years the following model, called the
   Iterated Waterfall  model, has proven itself an important one, for
  developing large software systems (direclty applying it to smaller projects
  is a bit cumbersome, but it is often applied in a modified way).
Each higher phase must finish before a lower phase begins (like water falling),
  but there are opportunities to return to earlier phases: a problem at a later
  phase may back up to an earlier one; and all phases can be reached again
  (iterated) during maintenance.
A more recent software methodology (better adapted for smaller projects that
  require  fewer programmers) is called 
   Extreme Programming .
It shares the idea of incremental development with the iterated waterfall
  model, but reaches these objectives a bit differently.
 
    
   
      
 
 In fact, maintenance is a curious term to appply to software, because
   unlike cars, for example, 
  Software has no parts that wear out and need to be replaced
    Software has no fluids that evaporate and need to be replished
  
So what constitutes software maintenance?
  Fixing errors
     Improving performance
     Increasing functionality
     Writing new code to meet new specifications
       Redesigning/Reimplementing/Recoding
     Rewriting old code to simplify it for future (anticipated) changes
       
So software has organic features: it continues to grow and evolve.
In fact, reliably working software continues to be used a long time.
The current Air-Traffic controller system is decades old; there have
  been a few attempts to design and code a replacement, but after
  billions of dollars, little progress has been made (many say because
  the specification keeps changing: see the next chart).
     




        Relative Costs to Fix Errors  
 
Review the Iterated Waterfall model of software development.
The following chart shows the cost to fix an error, depending on when the error
  was discoved during this process.
Notice that the sooner an error is discovered, the less expensive it is to fix. 
 
    
   
      
 
When we write Java programs, we will learn about language features that allow
  us to detect errors more quickly (and thus, fix them earlier and save our
  time, which is the  biggest cost of taking this course)
     




        Software Lifetime Costs  
 
We have learned that reliably working software continues to be used a
  long time.
Therefore, the following charts should come as no surprise
 (although it typically does).
 
    
   
      
 
The upshot of this chart is that software must be built initially in such a way
  that it is easy to maintain, because over the lifetime of a product,
  maintenance costs dominate.
One easy way to remember this chart is that the  maintenance cost  looks
  like a Pac-Man icon, gobbling up the  initial cost  to build.
     




        Software Project Sizes  
 
Although we will write only small software systems in this course, we should
  still keep the construction of large software systems in mind.
As we have seen in industry, often small software systems grow into large ones.
Software project sizes are roughly categorized as follows (where K means 1,000
  lines of code and M means 1 million lines of code)
     Tiny:   
     Small:    1K - 10 K 
    Medium:    10K - 100K 
    Large:    100K - 1 M 
    Huge:    &gt; 1M 
    
Writing a very large software project is like building a skyscraper, in terms
  of workforce, cost, and timetable.
But, it is notoriously difficult to predict software costs and schedules,
  compared to the building trades.
   
While most construction jobs can be estimated within 10% of time and budget,
  software jobs are lucky to be estimated with 300%.
Something like 60% of all software projects fail to be completed or deployed.
  -many $100 million projects are abandoned, with no usable product produced.
This is known as the  software crisis , which many attribute to the
  relative newness of programming as a discipline (
The area of Software Engineering is young, but quickly growing and maturing as
  software  finds its way into everything that we produce.
  
    




        Software Project Metrics  
 
Although software projects scale many magnitudes in sizes (the ones shown below
  are medium to huge), worker productivit rates fall into a much smaller range.
The following data came from an article, "How to Break the Software Logjam"
  from  Fortune magazine, Sept. 25, 1989 (pages 100-112).
 
     Company  Product 
   Lines x1K  Time worker-yrs  Cost x$1M 
   $/Line  Lines /Month /Worker      Ford  Continental 
   84  3.5  1.8 
   21  200    IBM  Checkout Scanner 
   90  58.0  3.0 
   33  129    Lotus  1 2 3 Spreadsheet 
   400  263.0  22.0 
   55  127    Citibank  ATM* 
   780  150.0  13.2 
   17  433    NASA  Space Shuttle 
   25,600  22,100  1,200 
   47  97    
*The Citibank ATM project was considered to be very successful.
Without it, all the other metrics would differ only by a factor of 2.
 
Note that  Code Lines/Month  is a bad metric to measure programmer
  productivity.
This is because a poor programmer may quickly produce many lines to do a
 simple task; while a good programmer will carefully write fewer lines of code
  to accomplish the same task, often producing simpler and easier to modify
  code, reproducing the same functionality in fewer lines of code.
Here are two relevant quotes from my homepage (there are lots of other
  interesting and relevant quotes there).
  
    
We flew down weekly to meet with IBM, but they thought the way to measure
  software was the amount of code we wrote, when really the better the
  software, the fewer lines of code.
  - W. Gates (discussing the writing of the original
    DOS operating system) 
  
Once the engineers find out that this is how they're being evaluated
  [by how many lines of code per day they are writing]
  they'll revert to cut-and-past programming to optimize their productivity
  rating.
They'll repeat the same code logic in as many places as possible in an effort
  not to look lazy.
Long-term benefits like maintainability and portability will be sacrificed on
  account of a poorly chosen metric.
   - B. Blunden (in "Cube Farm", page 140) 
     
But  Code Lines  is a good metric to measure maintenance cost (which we
  have seen overshadows by a large fact the original cost to build software).
So, the cost of maintaining a program is roughly proportional to its size.
  
This leads to an interesting anomoly: A programmer may exhibit what appears to
  be negative productivity by working to shrink the size of a program; but, the
  result is reduced maintanence cost over the lifetime of the software.
  
     
      Problem Set  
 
Mastering programming starts with mastering the syntax (form) and semantics
 (meaning) of a programming language.
Before we begin our study of computer languages, we can investigate these
  topics in a natural language.
Although these are not questions about programming, answering them requires
  thinking like a programmer.

    would give a second thought.
  Carefully examine these two sentences and explain their difference, possibly
     by restating the intent of these signs using more words.
  Hint: "Shoes must be worn!" does not refer to shoes being old/worn-out.
