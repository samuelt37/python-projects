IN4MATX 43. Introduction to Software Engineering (4). Concepts, methods, and current practice of software engineering. Large-scale software production, software life cycle models, principles and techniques for each stage of development.        Required Textbook  
Tsui, Karam, Bernal, "Essentials of Software Engineering," Third Ed.     Quiz Dates  
There will be 6 quizzes, as shown in the schedule below. Quizzes will generally be held from 6:05-6:20. Additional quizzes may be given without prior notice, and the time and length of the quizzes may change.     Grades  
Grades are based on an "overall average" for each student that is computed at the end of the quarter. The overall average is a weighted average of the following:       Quizzes: 11% (total for all quizzes; each student's lowest quiz score will be dropped)  
      Midterm: 25%  
      Final: 25%  
      Three homeworks: 36% (12% each)  
      Class attendance and participation: 3%  
      Submitting the EEE course evaluation: 0.5% extra credit   
   The overall average, on a 0-100 scale, is converted to a letter grade as follows: A or A- for 90 or up; B+, B, or B- for 80 to 89; C+, C, or C- for 70 to 79, and so on. These ranges may be modified slightly.               Course Mailing List

Late work will not be accepted, except in truly extenuating circumstances for which the student can produce documentation validating their circumstance (e.g., a doctor's note, a police report, etc.)     Academic Dishonesty     Academic Dishonesty will not be tolerated in any shape or form. You will be held responsible for any and all actions whether they were performed indirectly (i.e. you left your computer unmonitored, someone stole your password, you left a printed version of your work in the lab). Remember, the burden of proof is on you. The staff must solely determine that academic dishonesty has occurred, and hope that those responsible will own up to their actions. In cases where neither student admits their participation, both will receive the same sanctions on a course-level (Note: campus-wide sanctions are determined by the Associate Dean of your department). Cheating will be detected by TurnItIn.com and/or manually by the graders. Please note that instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected in the final grade because dishonesty devalues the learning experience for the whole class.               Students with Disabilities  
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Please also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.     Schedule     Note: This schedule is subject to change.
