3.35.12 SetMaxMatches 
 
   
bool SetMaxMatches(unsigned int max)
    
This method sets the maximum number of subgraphs to be determined by the
OESubSearch::Match methods.  Once the maximum number of subgraphs have been
found the search for additional subgraphs is terminated.  By default,
instances of OESubSearch are constructed with a maximum number of matches
set to 1024.  The constraint on the maximum number of matches can be
removed by calling this method with a value of zero.
