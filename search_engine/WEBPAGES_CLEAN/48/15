 CFP - WORKSHOP PROPOSALS 
  The Workshops at the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE) provide a forum for researchers and industry participants to discuss topics in global software engineering research and practice. The goal of the ICGSE Workshops is two-fold. First, they will provide opportunities for researchers to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at various stages of development. Second, ICGSE Workshops also serve as conduits to develop scientific communities around a particular topic and research agenda. We seek proposals from multiple disciplines to expand the ICGSE community. Thus, in addition to software engineering topics, we encourage topics such as work done in the area of human, social and behavioral sciences within the larger context of global software engineering. The workshops will provide a platform for discussions and free exchange of ideas, allowing parallel disciplines to interconnect and benefit from a mutual exchange of experiences. 

 The Workshop Committee will review workshop proposals based on the criteria outlined below. Workshops may be either half-day or full-day events to be held prior to the main conference. Participation in ICGSE workshops is typically open, that is, it is not limited just to authors of accepted submissions. Workshops will have the option to publish their accepted submissions in extra volume of the conference proceedings published by IEEE.

   Requirements for Workshop Proposal Submission</strong> 
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than 4 pages in length. They should contain the following information:  
 • Title and brief description of the workshop, specifying the goals and the technical issues that will be its focus.   
 • A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest. 
 • The expected number of participants.  
 • The format of the workshop.  
 • A list of related workshops or similar events held in the last 2 years, if any.

 • The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the proposed organizing committee. This committee should consist of at least two people knowledgeable in the technical issues to be addressed.   
 • A description of the qualifications of the proposed organizing committee with respect to organizing this workshop (e.g., papers published in the proposed topic area, previous workshop organizing experiences, and other relevant information).  
 • Each workshop will be provided with a laptop projector and screen. Internet will also be available. Any other requests should be included in the proposal.  
   Each workshop organizing committee will be responsible for the following:</strong>

 • Selecting the format of the workshop.   
 • Selecting the papers to be accepted to the workshop.  
 • Limit the length of any requested workshop papers to five (5) pages with papers following the ICGSE 2016 Format and Submission Guidelines (IEEE formatting, US Letter, two-column size).  
 • All advertising of the workshop beyond the listing on the conference web page and a combined workshops Call for Submissions that will be sent by the Conference Organizers to SEWORLD (per SEWORLD rules). 
   Acceptance</strong>  
 Workshop proposals will be reviewed by the Workshop Committee and evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 • The potential to advance the state of global software engineering research and practice  
 • The organizers’ commitment to stimulate discussion at the workshop 
 • The organizers’ experience and ability to lead a successful workshop  
 • Timeliness and expected interest in the workshop topics  
   Additional information:</strong> 
 • Five or more participants must register for the workshop for it to run
