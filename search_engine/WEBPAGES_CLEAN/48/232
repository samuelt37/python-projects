  XML-LANG  
      Self-description with Document Type Definition (DTD):
 
  Structural rules of the documentï¿½s markup
  External entities, internal entities, non-XML resource entities
       Non-Minimization (All Markup is Explicit)
 
     XML Processor - customizable info structures
 
  Most XML users will not know they are using a DTD!
  XML-aware software works with custom XML apps without help 
       Document Validity = Conforms to DTD
 
  Document well-formedness = structurally sound, but no DTD
  Required Markup Declaration (RMD) indicates need for DTD
  Well-formedness for delivery format, validity for authoring
