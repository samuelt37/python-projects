 Abstract  
Many algorithms for processing probabilistic networks are dependent on the topological
properties of the problem's structure. Such algorithms (e.g., clustering, conditioning) are
effective only if the problem has a sparse graph captured by parameters such as tree
width and cycle-cutset size. In this paper we initiate a study to determine the potential of
structure-based algorithms in real-life applications. We analyze empirically the 
structural properties of problems coming from the circuit diagnosis domain. Speciffically,
we locate those properties that capture the effectiveness of clustering and conditioning as 
well as of a family of conditioning+clustering algorithms designed to gradually trade space
for time. We perform our analysis on 11 benchmark circuits widely used in the testing 
community. We also report on the effect of ordering heuristics on tree-clustering
and show that, on our benchmarks, the well known max-cardinality ordering is 
substantially inferior to an ordering called min-degree.
