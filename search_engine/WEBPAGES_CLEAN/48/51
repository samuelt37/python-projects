 Optimal-time Dynamic Mesh Refinement 

 Benoit Hudson 

 Abstract: 

 In February, Gary Miller presented our results on static mesh
refinement: the problem was to, given an input geometry, produce an
output tetrahedral mesh where every tetrahedron has good aspect ratio.
This requires adding some additional points to the input; he showed how
to minimize (to within a constant factor) the number of points in the
output, and how to run in optimal sequential time. 

 When the mesh domain changes after the first timestep, we now need to
solve the dynamic mesh refinement problem: how to maintain a small but
good quality mesh as we change the input.  I will show that after
addding or removing points from the input, the mesh refinement algorithm
of Bern, Eppstein, and Gilbert can recompute the output quality mesh in
O(logÂ  L / s ) time.  This uses the automatic
dynamization techniques of Acar, which ensures that the dynamic
algorithm is no harder to implement than the static algorithm. 

 In two dimensions, we can extend this to do even better: by
dynamizing a post-processing algorithm of Har-Peled and Ungor, we can
maintain a mesh as small as is known how to produce in practice, at no
additional asymptotic cost. 

 I expect this joint work with Umut Acar (TTI-C) to be of particular
interest to geometers, dynamic algorithmaticians, and scientific
computers.
