 	    Short Bio 
                 
                     I have received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from    Universit&amp;agrave
                Bocconi  (Milan, Italy) in 2005.
                While working on my Ph.D. dissertation, I have  spent a year as  a visiting scholar in the   Department of Statistical Sciences   at Duke University, where afterward I was employed for a few months as a Research Assistant.  
                From 2005 to 2007, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the   Department of Biostatistics  at the   University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , and then I obtained my first faculty position as Assistant Professor in Statistics in the   Department of Mathematics and Statistics  of the   University of New Mexico   (2007-2010).  
                Prior to joining UCI in the Fall 2016, I was holding a position as  Assistant Professor (with award of tenure) in the   Department of Biostatistics  at the   University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center   (2010-2016).  
                
       
                
                 I am currently a member of the   American Statistical Association (ASA)  ,   the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) , and the    International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA).

                      Analysis of high-dimensional data, including genomic and imaging data. Data integration for combining information from several data platforms, and relating them with measurable outcomes (integrative genomics, imaging genomics), statistical decision making under uncertainty, multiple comparison problems, clustering, Bayesian modeling, Bayesian Nonparametrics
