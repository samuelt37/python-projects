 Back to  Puzzle 
 
   Segmentation 
  Input:</strong> Photo of puzzle pieces  Output:</strong> List of (x,y) pairs for each puzzle piece
 
    Level set methods
  Yutian's ncut-derived method
  NJ's ideas from media class
     Contour extraction / representation 
  Input:</strong> List of (x,y) pairs for each puzzle piece  Output:</strong> Some nicer representation?  Perhaps a bunch of "piece objects"?
 
    Relative angles
  Discretised directions --&gt; BLAST
  "Continuous" directions --&gt; Correlation?
    Eamon's shape representation
  Alter slightly to accommodate comparisons
    Local polynomials, curvature
  Raman's n-gram approach
     Comparison / local matching 
  Techniques depend on representation
  Can include color, texture, etc.
     Global solution / energy minimization 
  Jon's approach for canonical puzzles
  Belief propagation / affinity propagation
  More ideas?  Simple BFS?
     Final reconstruction / assembly 
  Stitch the pieces together so they look nice
