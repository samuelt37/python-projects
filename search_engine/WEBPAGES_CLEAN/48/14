  23 February 1996: 
Thrackles 
Mike Dillencourt, ICS, UC Irvine 

A thrackle is a graph that can be drawn in the plane so that 

  its edges are represented by simple curves; and 

 any two distinct edges either meet at a single common endpoint
or cross at exactly one point, interior to both curves. 
 

Thirty years ago, Conway conjectured that an  n -vertex
thrackle has at most  n  edges. Lov√°sz, Pach and
Szegedy recently made major progress towards resolving this
conjecture, by proving that an  n -vertex thrackle has at most
2 n  edges. In this talk, I will present their proof.
