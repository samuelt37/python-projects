  Andre  van der Hoek</strong>  Professor and Chair, Department of Informatics</strong>  DEGREE: Ph.D. 2000, University of Colorado, Boulder  RESEARCH AREAS:  Software Engineering  RESEARCH INTERESTS:  Dr. van der Hoek's research lies in the fields of configuration management and software architecture, focusing on two research questions: (1) how to better coordinate the activities of multiple, geographically distributed developers and (2) how to better leverage higher levels of abstraction in designing and implementing software systems. Software engineering education is an additional interest of Dr. van der Hoek. His research explores how simulation can aid students in learning more about the software engineering process.
