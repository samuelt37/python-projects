Welcome to the lab for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics at  School of Information and Computer Sciences  of   University of California, Irvine !     

Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, especially in the areas of genomics, systems biology and neural computation.
