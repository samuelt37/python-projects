						 Introduction 

						 
						
								The Alderis project focuses on the application of Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) and meta-modeling to specify a common semantic domain for the analysis of distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems.
						
						 
						
						 
						
								The Alderis language has both a visual and textual syntax with formally defined semantics. Alderis models can be verified directly by the open-source Distributed Real-time Embedded Analysis Method (DREAM) tool available for download at  http://dre.sourceforge.net .
						
						 
						
						
						 Motivation 

						 
						
Component-based development is an emerging paradigm for the design of distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems with hard QoS support. Components refer to reusable pieces of solutions, which can be configured and composed together to provide a service. Alderis plans to support this paradigm shift by providing a language and semantic domain for the model-driven development (MDD) of DRE systems.
						
						 
				
						 Model-Driven Development 

						 
						
The Alderis language is specified using meta-modeling as shown in the figure below. We use the  GME  modeling environment to specify Alderis. The figure shows a part of the Alderis meta-model with its corresponding concrete syntax. The red arrows show how modeling elements and their relations are specified by the meta-model.

						 

      Formal Verification &amp; Analysis 

						 
						
A key property of the Alderis language is that it has formally defined semantics allowing real-time verification using timed automata model checker tools such as  UPPAAL  and the  Verimag IF toolset . The  DREAM  tool provides a way to automatically generate the timed automata models from the Alderis specification.  DREAM  also provides a way for random simulations that can be used efficiently to find bugs in designs that are too large and lead to state space explosions.
