         Hello all! Here’s a recap of the events WICS has been hosting for the past few weeks on campus. Week 4 WICS hosted a study session for around 22 members who came out to study with each other. During the middle of midterms season, it’s always nice to have some people from the same majors and classes to study with. We hope that all of you are done with midterms and studying well for finals now! Come de-stress tonight for a little bit at the ICS Potluck and have some fun socializing and playing board games with other members! 
 On Monday of Week 6, WICS hosted a Yahoo Interview Workshop during which approximately 40 members received great information and tips about the do’s and don’ts regarding the interview and hiring processes. Members left the meeting feeling more confident and less nervous about the interviewing process in general. Much thanks to our Yahoo representative who spent time with us to lead us in a successful and informative workshop! 
 Week 7 WICS had a crepe booth and a night of bowling with some Google representatives. Thank you to all who came out to help run the booth and support the club by buying some delicious crepes! Members also had a fun time bowling and interacting with some people who work at Google. We hope to have more of these fun and informative events in the future to allow members to network with representatives from tech companies. Much thanks to the Google representatives who came out to spend time and network with our WICS members!

          WICS and Pariveda Solutions representatives hosted a fun, interactive workshop on April 11th to help train our members in understanding what to do and how to think in a case study based interview.  After a short introduction of the company, WICS members organized into groups to solve a specific case study problem together, and two of the groups got the chance to present their findings and solutions.  All of our members learned a lot in regards to tackling a case study problem, asking questions during this type of interview, and contributing to teamwork and collaboration overall.  We’d like to thank the representatives for their time in helping us host an informative and successful workshop!

  On the 13th of April, WICS hosted a LinkedIn event that introduced students to Lean In and what it meant to be apart of a Lean In circle. There were over 30 students who attended the info session! The Lean In representatives, Michelle Carrega and Kunbi Adeyemo, lead an activity in which each group of students would learn more about their others in their group by answering questions about themselves and sharing their experiences. The activity was a huge success in which most people did enjoy participating in! The activity was meant to show how people in a small, unfamiliar group can have a deeper connection with each other. Following the activity, Kunbi presented an informative presentation of how students can form a chapter at UCI and start their own circles as well. This event showed how beneficial it can be to have students circles, allowing members to help each other by creating monthly meet ups for discussions and check ups on their process of achieving their goals.

         WICS kicked off the 2016 Spring Quarter on Monday the 28 th  with pizza and some general announcements for the quarter. Co-presidents Angela Liu and Stephanie Eng announced the recently elected new board members for next year. The new T-shirt design was also presented along with some of the future events the club is planning on hosting. There were approximately 40 WICS members in attendance at this meeting and many of them won some cool swag that the club raffled off. We hope to see these faces and more at our future events. Stay tuned for what’s coming up in WICS during this quarter!

          On Wednesday, February 25, WICS hosted an Adobe Photoshop workshop where students were able to learn the basics to get started. We had our very own Alicia Xu, UCI’s student representative of Adobe, to lead the workshop. This was her first time teaching and she did an excellent job! There were around 30 people who attended and were ready to learn. Alicia went over what an artboard was, how to add shapes, change colors, add layers and images, using selection tools like the lasso, and drawing with brushes. Overall, the event went really well! Free Adobe swag was given out to people who answered questions correctly or asked Alicia questions. Someone even asked if there would be more workshops for intermediate and advanced users, so we could possibly follow up with that in the future.

         On Monday, February 8, WICS and ACM co-hosted an info session with Originate where students were able to learn different interview tips and tricks, and also about the company as a whole. There was a surplus of pizza, so the event started off with everyone on a full stomach. People from originate talked about the work atmosphere, their experiences there and what they expected from students/recent grads that aspire to work there in the future. One of the staff also gave a small introduction to an improved version of CSS called Flexi. She led us to the basics, and at the end of her presentation, she taught us through how to make a simple web page, using some of the new techniques and terms that we just learned. We ended the night with a student solving a problem that would most likely be given at an Originate interview and also some networking.

         WICS and WIL (Women in Leadership) co-hosted a workshop with Deloitte Consulting on Friday, February 5 from 10:30 am – 12:30 pm. The session started with an introduction to the company. Then, some of their key players, such as Tanya Dancekelly, the Principal at Deloitte Consulting, spoke about their work-life balance, their time leading to Deloitte, their college years, and other topics from Q&amp;A. It was both a pleasure and an inspiration to hear from such amazing and successful female leaders. 
 Afterwards, Deloitte wanted to give the students in the room a taste of the consultant work. First, they started with a presentation about what it means to be a consultant, the work involved, and tips for being a great consultant. Then they have students break off into groups to work on a sample case about consolidating data when switching to a new data management application. Deloitte mentors were present to explain (e.g. what is ERP?) and give helpful hints and students practice, essentially, approaching an interview question. 
 The event wrapped up with networking and delicious sandwiches from Corner Bakery. 
 Deloitte Consulting is looking for juniors to join their internship program. Their posting is found on Zotlink as Summer Scholar Intern – Business Technology Analyst. The deadline to submit your resume is February 18, 2016.

          With midterms coming from left and right, WICS hosted a study session on Monday, February 1st. Over 30 people joined us to study. Groups of two to six people were scattered throughout the room studying, learning and munching on snacks. Despite the stressful time, it was still a relaxing place to get things done, make some friends and prepare for midterms.  Good luck on midterms everyone!

          WICS hosted a Board Game and Movie night to help anyone who wanted to take a break from studying on Monday, January 25th. Various board and card games were set out on three different tables so that people could feel free to play and socialize with other members. People who wanted to see a movie watched    Mean Girls    on the main screen. Over 20 people joined us in the fun. With midterms coming up, the event was a space where people could take a breather and relax with other students.

          Wednesday, January 20th was the day of WICS’ Mock Technical Interviews. Industry professionals from well-known companies including Google, Adobe, Amazon, Yahoo!, and Socal Edison contributed their time to giving mock technical interviews as well as feedback to students who signed up ahead of time. From 10am to 5pm, students showed up well dressed to the Career Center, where the event took place, for their 30 minute long technical interviews. Interviewees were given feedback forms filled out by the interviewers as well as free water, snacks, and swag. This event proved itself to be very helpful to ICS students since it exposed them to what a real job or internship interview is like. It also presented areas for each individual to improve upon, provided a great way to practice for an upcoming opportunity, and for a selected few, even offered them a real interview for a position with the company! WICS is excited to have thrown such a successful and beneficial event for the ICS community at UCI, and is looking forward to putting together more in the future.

          WICS kicked off the 2016 winter quarter on Monday January 4th with a brief session of introductions and announcements and also some fun board games to welcome WICS members back to school. WICS co-presidents Angela Liu and Stephanie Eng introduced the board and new committee members and gave an overview of the events that we will have this quarter, including company info sessions, social nights, mock technical interviews, and crepe booths.
