The AtomMatch method is the effective combination of sequential calls
to AddConstraint followed by SingleMatch.  AtomMatch searches for a
single valid subgraph isomorphism starting with the passed target atom
mapped to the first pattern atom with which the OESubSearch was
initialized.  The method can be called using either an OEAtomBase or
OEQAtomBase pointer.  If a valid subgraph is identified the method
will return true.
