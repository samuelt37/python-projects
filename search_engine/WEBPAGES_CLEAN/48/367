3.24.30 Sweep 
 

 
    
virtual bool Sweep()
    
Renumber the atom and bond indices sequentially.  This function
invalidates the atom and bond indices of all atoms in a molecule.
Note that this function doesn't guarantee that all atom and bond
indices are sequential upon completion (some molecule implementations
may treat OEMolBase::Sweep as a no-op).
