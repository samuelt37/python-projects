 Geometry in Action: Graphics<body>

 
 
  
 
  
  Graphics 

This area is quite closely connected with computational geometry; for
instance ACM TOG often publishes computational geometry papers.
Geometric research topics in graphics include data structures for ray
tracing, clipping, and radiosity; hidden surface
elimination algorithms; automatic simplification for distant objects;
morphing; clustering for color quantization; converting triangulated
surfaces to strips of triangles (some graphics engines
take inputs in this form to save bandwidth); and construction of
low-discrepancy point sets (for oversampling to eliminate Moire effects
in ray tracing).  Specialized applications of graphics
in which other geometric ideas are needed include
 architecture ,
 virtual reality , and
 video game programming .
This area is also related to  mesh generation 
in several ways: both fields use triangulation algorithms to partition 
complex surfaces into simpler pieces, and radiosity calculations in
graphics are essentially a special case of the finite element method.

    Mosaic / stained glass graphic effect .  One gets interesting
visual effects by taking a random sample of pixels from a bitmap image,
computing the Voronoi diagram of the sample, and filling each cell
with the corresponding sample's color.  This appears to be what
Photoshop does in its "Pixelate-&gt;Crystalize" filter;
it can be thought of as a form of piecewise constant function interpolation.
