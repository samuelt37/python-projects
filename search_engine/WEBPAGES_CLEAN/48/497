void OETriposAtomNames(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
The  OETriposAtomNames  function sets the atom name property of each
atom, using the  OEAtomBase::SetName  method, to follow the convention
typically followed in Sybyl .mol2 files.  Each atom is named by its
atomic symbol (or ``Du'' for element zero) followed by a sequential
index per atomic number.  For example, the first carbon in the molecule
is named ``C1'', the second ``C2'', and so on.  Similarly, the first
oxygen is named ``O1'' and so on.

  
The ordering of atoms is taken from the iterator returned by the
 OEMolBase::GetAtoms  method (and may therefore be changed by using
 OEMolBase::OrderAtoms ) and is unchanged by this function.
