15.7.6 getline 
 
   
bool getline(char          *buffer, oefpos_t max)
bool getline(signed char   *buffer, oefpos_t max)
bool getline(unsigned char *buffer, oefpos_t max)
bool getline(std::string   &amp;buffer, oefpos_t max)
bool getline(std::string   &amp;buffer)
    
Retrieves the next text line from the stream and directly copies its contents
into the  buffer  parameter. The newline character is not copied with
the rest of the contents. The  max  parameter specifies the maximum
number of characters allowed per line. If a newline character is not found
within the specified number of characters, only the specified number of
characters will be copied into the buffer and all the remaining characters in
the stream before the next newline character will be discarded.
