The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15 n /2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex  k -gon
is O( n  α( n,  k )).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  510, 1991, 674–685.   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  1 (1): 79–92, 1991 .
 
Discusses the expected behavior of Delaunay triangulations for
points chosen uniformly at random (without edge effects).
The main result is that within a region containing  n  points,
the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor
of log  n  / log log  n.

    On nearest-neighbor graphs . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. S. Paterson ,
and F. F. Yao.   Disc. Comp. Geom.  17: 263–282, 1997 .
 
Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things
that any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter  D  has O( D  9 ) vertices.
This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists
of improving that bound to O( D  5 ), which is tight.
