 Mechanism:<body> Mechanism: Communication Intermediation  Intent       Communication intermediation "interposes"    functionality between a service provider (e.g., server) and a    service consumer (e.g., client).   Also Known As       Proxy?   Motivation        A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below.     Applicability        What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations?          An applicable situation          Participants       The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities.        Participant Name: Responsibility for what         Collaborations       How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities.        [Collaboration]         Consequences       Communication intermediation has the following benefits:        They do not alter the service provider or consumer.          Their overhead is amortized in high cost operations.          They facilitate logging and playback. Because all the            interaction between the service provider and consumer            occurs by way of the communication intermediator, the            interactions may be logged and played back at a later            time.       Communication intermediation has the following    limitations:       They apply only to explicit communication channels.        Implementation        What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues?          Description of Bullet          Known Uses       Firewalls, Web proxy servers, and CORBA interceptors are    examples of communication intermediation.   Related Mechanisms       See  reified connectors     and  instrumented    connectors  for more specific instances of the    communication intermediation mechanism.      Backto the Adaptation home page   .
