                Stereochemistry Histogram 
                 
                  Histogram of number of stereocenters per chemical in
                  ChemDB on a log scale. The fraction of compounds with at most
                  16 isomers (4 stereocenters) is 97.5%. All entries with 50 or more
                  stereocenters are binned at 50.

             Strong Correlation Example 
               
                Two-dimensional histogram of the chemicals with respect to the number of rotatable bonds and
                rigid segments in each. The diagonal and "thin" arrangement of the combined distribution
                indicates that these two properties exhibit a strong positive correlation.
                Of course, this is to be expected since rigid segments are specifically defined here as
                the number of segments delimited by rotatable bonds.
             
          

          Moderate Correlation Example 
          
               
                Two-dimensional histogram of the chemicals with respect to molecular weight and
                calculated XLogP value, an estimate of the chemical's water / oil partition coefficient
                often used to approximate a chemical's solubility and thus permeability through phospholipid,
                biological membranes. The diagonal shape indicates a positive correlation between these two
                properties, but the broad shape indicates a weak relationship.
