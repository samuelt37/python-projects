Name/Instance Distinction

     A property name URI names the syntax and semantics of the property.
 
  Only one instance of a property may be created on a resource (but may be multi-valued)
  �live� properties: server maintains consistency by enforcing syntax and semantics
  non-live properties: client enforces syntax and semantics (property may be inconsistent)
       Benefits:
 
  server can provide properties with values it generates
  client can define new properties unknown to the server
  major benefit: flexibility       --&gt;
