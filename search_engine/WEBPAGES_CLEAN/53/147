 m2html: Convert email to HTML 

  

This directory contains C++ code
for a program to convert mail files
(piped to standard input, in emacs rmail or unix mail format)
to reasonably nice-looking HTML.
It separates out headers from text,
reformats the headers, identifies email addresses and embedded URLs,
and converts reserved characters (angle brackets and ampersand).
  
Free to a good home.
Use at your own risk.
For an example of its output,
see some messages of mine
on  triangle
packing  from 
 The
Geometry Junkyard .
