299: Computational Photography [Winter 2012]    

 This is an experimental seminar course I am trying out for
the first time. This course has been possible due to my student,   Behzad
Sajadi  . His interest in the domain of computational photography
motivated us to start exploring this area together. So, in this course, Behzad
will be taking the lead. He has prepared lecture notes on the fundamental
concepts in computational photography which he will present and we will spend
the first few weeks (5-6) exploring these concepts. We hope that following that
the students will be ready to explore on their own and we will start reading
some papers. The course should be an enjoyable ride through an entirely
different area and from our already interesting couple of classes, I am
anticipating that all of us will have a fun time in this course. I will put the
lecture notes online and keep updating it with each class.
