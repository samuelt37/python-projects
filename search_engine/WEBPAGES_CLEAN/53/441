   Simultaneous strong separations of
probabilistic and unambiguous complexity classes . 
D. Eppstein,
 
L. Hemachandra , J. Tisdall, and B. Yener.  Int. Conf. Computing and Information,  Toronto,
North-Holland, 1989, pp. 65–70. 
Tech. Rep. 335, Dept. Comp. Sci., U. Rochester, 1990.   Mathematical Systems Theory  25 (1): 23–36, 1992 .
 
Structural complexity theory.
Constructs oracles in which BPP (a probabilistic complexity class)
and UP (the class of problems with a unique "witness")
contain languages that in a very strong sense are not contained in the
other class.
The conference version used the title
"Probabilistic and unambiguous computation are incomparable".
