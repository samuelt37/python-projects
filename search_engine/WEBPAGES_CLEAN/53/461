The Maximized Average Tree Pruning Problem
 
Presented by Josiah Carlson
 
 
Abstract: In this talk we will define the maximized average tree
pruning problem, we will describe the pitfalls in solving the problem,
and we will finally describe our algorithm which has worst-case
O(nÂ log 2n ) running time.
  
This is a joint work of Josiah Carlson and David Eppstein.
