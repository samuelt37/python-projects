 Abstract  
Constraints are a declarative knowledge representation formalism that allows 
for a compact and expressive modeling of many real-life problems. Constraint
satisfaction and propagation tools, as well as constraint programming 
languages, are successfully used to model, solve, and reason about many classes
of problems, such as design, diagnosis, scheduling, spatio-temporal reasoning, 
resource allocation, configuration, network optimization, and graphical interfaces.
