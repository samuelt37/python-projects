We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,
and partitions of those rectangles into smaller rectangles, to form
stylized visualizations of hierarchically subdivided geographic regions.
There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much
of the geographic information from the input we require the output to preserve.
  
    Strict confluent drawing .

 B. Speckmann , and
 K. Verbeek .  arXiv:1308.6824 .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Bordeaux, France, 2013.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 352–363 .   J. Computational Geometry  7 (1): 22–46, 2016 .
 
A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.
  
    Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines . 
D. Eppstein,
M. van Garderen,
 B. Speckmann , and
 T. Ueckerdt .  21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing  (poster), Bordeaux, France, 2013. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.  arXiv:1601.06865 .  
We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

We use quadtrees to handle point location queries in an amount of time
that depends on the distance of the query point to the nearest region
boundary.
  
    Folding a paper strip to minimize thickness .  E. Demaine ,
D. Eppstein,
 A. Hesterberg ,
 H. Ito ,
 A. Lubiw ,
 R. Uehara , and
 Y. Uno .   arXiv:1411.6371 .  9th International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation (WALCOM
2015) , Dhaka, Bangladesh.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  8973 (2015), pp. 113–124 .   Journal of Discrete
Algorithms  36: 18–26, 2016 .  
If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.
  
    All-pairs minimum cuts in near-linear time for surface-embedded graphs .  G. Borradaile ,
D. Eppstein,
 A. Nayyeri ,
and  C. Wulff-Nilsen .  arXiv:1411.7055 .  Proc. 32nd Int. Symp. Computational Geometry , Boston, 2016.  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) 51, pp. 22:1–22:16 .  
We give the first known near-linear algorithms for constructing
Gomory–Hu trees of bounded-genus graphs, and we shave a log off
the time for the same problem on planar graphs.
  
    Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1502.05334 .   J. Graph Algorithms &amp;
Applications  20 (2): 323–346, 2016 .
 
We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.
  
    Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled
planarity .  M. J. Bannister ,
 W. E. Devanny , and
 V. Dujmović ,
D. Eppstein, and
 D. R. Wood .  arXiv:1506.09145 .  24th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Athens, Greece, 2016.  
We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.
The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout,
and uses the title "Track Layout is Hard".
  
    Rigid origami vertices: Conditions and forcing sets .  Z. Abel ,

 J. Ku ,
 R. Lang , and
 T. Tachi .  arXiv:1507.01644 .   J. Computational Geometry  7 (1): 171–184, 2016 .
 
We give an exact characterization of the one-vertex origami folding
patterns that can be folded rigidly, without bending the parts of the
paper between the folds.
  
    Treetopes and their graphs . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1510.03152 .   27th ACM-SIAM
Symp. on Discrete Algorithms , Arlington, 2016, pp. 969–984 .  
We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

2016) , Ensenada, Mexico.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  9644 (2016), pp. 403–415 .
 
We study the problem of splitting the vertices of a given graph into a
bounded number of sub-vertices (with each edge attaching to one of the
sub-vertices) in order to make the resulting graph planar.
It is NP-complete, but can be approximated to within a constant factor,
and is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth.

    From discrepancy to majority . 
D. Eppstein
and  D. S. Hirschberg .  arXiv:1512.06488 .  Proc. 12th Latin American Theoretical Informatics Symposium (LATIN
2016) , Ensenada, Mexico.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  9644 (2016), pp. 390–402 .
 
We provide upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of a problem
in which the input is a collection
of two-colored items, and the problem is to either find an item of the
majority color or to determine that there is no majority,
by performing queries that determine the discrepancy of fixed-size
subsets of the items.

    Cuckoo filter: simplification and analysis . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1604.06067 .  Proc. 15th Scandinavian Symposium and Workshops on Algorithm
Theory (SWAT 2016) , Reykjavik, Iceland.  Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) 53, pp. 8.1–8.12 .
 
A cuckoo filter is an approximate set data structure that can be used in
place of a Bloom filter, but with several practical advantages: it uses
less space, has better locality of reference, and can handle element
deletions. We provide the first theoretical analysis of a simplified
variation of cuckoo filters, showing that these advantages can be
guaranteed to hold theoretically and not just experimentally.

    The computational hardness of  d K-series .  W. E. Devanny ,
D. Eppstein, and
B. Tilman.  NetSci2016  poster session, Seoul, Korea.
 
The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
 d -dimensional tensor, describing the number of  d -tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any  d  ≥ 3, or for  d  = 2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).
  
    Models and algorithms for graph watermarking . 
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich ,
 J. Lam ,
N. Mamano,
 M. Mitzenmacher , and
M. Torres.  arXiv:1605.09425 .  Proc. 19th Information Security Conference (ISC 2016) , Honolulu,
Hawaii.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci.  9866 (2016), pp. 283–301 .
 
We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.
  
    Maximizing the sum of radii of disjoint balls or disks . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:1607.02184 .  Proc. 28th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry , Vancouver, BC,
Canada, 2016.  
We show how to find a system of disjoint balls with given centers,
maximizing the sum of radius of the balls. Our algorithm takes cubic
time in arbitrary metric spaces and can be sped up to subquadratic time
in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension.

    Scheduling autonomous vehicle platoons through an unregulated
intersection . 
J. Besa,
 W. E. Devanny ,
D. Eppstein, and
 M. T. Goodrich .  Proc. 16th Worksh. Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation
Modelling, Optimization and Systems (ATMOS 2016) , Aarhus, Denmark,
2016.  OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs) 54, Schloss
Dagstuhl (2016), pp. 5:1–5.16 .  arXiv:1609.04512 .  
We consider a model of vehicle scheduling in which vehicles arrive at an
intersection in indivisible platoons (or individual vehicles of variable
length) and the goal is to find a schedule for them to all cross the
intersection without collisions, minimizing the maximimum delay incurred
by any platoon. We show that for many types of intersections, an optimal
schedule can be found in polynomial time by a combination of dynamic
programming and parametric search.
