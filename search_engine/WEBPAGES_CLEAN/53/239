 Abstract  
This paper reports students' projects performed during the 275a class: "Network-based
reasoning: belief networks", in the department of Information and Computer Science at
UC-Irvine, taught by Rina Dechter. Students were required to select one problem from the
 
Bayesian Repository Benchmarks  and to run a comparative study of several known 
algorithms and report the results. This paper include five of the students' reports. 
The problems used are: Pigs, Diabetes, Insurance, HailFinder and ALARM.
