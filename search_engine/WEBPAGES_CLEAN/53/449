 LifeLines 

LifeLines is a genealogical software system for UNIX and related systems.
LifeLines was written by Tom Wetmore, ttw@shore.net
and is archived at ftp.cac.psu.edu. 
 
You can store any kind and any amount of data in a LifeLines database,
and you can process and generate output based on that data in any way
and in any format.
Also, databases in GEDCOM format can be input and output.
  
The UNIX version of LifeLines is freeware.
The DOS port (which required only minimal modifications)
was done by Dan Hirschberg.
