             Architecture Description Languages (ADL's) 
          

   
     
 Architecture is a broad concept, and each project/domain's
notion of what an architecture is and what sorts of data it should
contain is different (and rightly so!)  Furthermore, the purpose of an architecture
description is largely driven by project stakeholders and their needs.
Thus, no one ADL will ever fit all projects or domains.    —    Eric M. Dashofy   
   
     Concepts 
   
      Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) describe principal architecture design decisions . Traditionally this has included a system's components, connectors, and configuration. 
      A large number of  domain-specific  and general-purpose ADLs have been published  and are used in various areas with focus on specific architectural issues:  ACME  focuses on architectural interchange,  Rapide  focuses on simulation, and  Meta-H  focuses on including hardware concepts, there are many others. 
      However, a single ADL will  never  fit all projects or domains.  Architecture is a broad concept, and each project/domain's notion of what an architecture is and what sorts of data it should contain is different (and rightly so!) Furthermore, the purpose of an architecture description is largely driven by project stakeholders and their needs. 
   

     Techniques 
   
       Modularize ADLs  . Embracing the fact that no single ADL will ever fit all projects or domains, use an ADL that will support controlled, verifiable extension to express new concepts and concerns. 
       Utilize XML for modeling the architecture of software systems  . Utilizing XML provides unprecedented extensibility and flexibility, as well as basic support from the many available commercial XML tools. 
   

     Notations 
      xADL 2.0    an extensible and flexible XML-based ADL. xADL 2.0 ships with a number of predefined  xADL 2.0 Schema , or may be extended by your own schema to express the concepts important to your project.  
       xArch   [LEGACY]  a standard, extensible XML-based representation for software architectures. 
      C2 SADL   [LEGACY]  a language for defining architectures built according to the  C2 style  
      Tools 
      Apigen   - XML schema-to-Java data binding generator for xArch schemas
