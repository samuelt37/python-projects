     Research Faculty      »</strong>  Pierre  Baldi     »</strong>  Charless  Fowlkes     »</strong>  Wayne  Hayes     »</strong>  Richard  Lathrop     »</strong>  Eric  Mjolsness     »</strong>  Babak  Shahbaba     »</strong>  Xiaohui  Xie       There are a number of significant problems in biology and medicine for which
  computational approaches can yield important results.  
 The worldwide efforts to
            construct databases of protein and small molecule structures, DNA sequences,
            metabolic pathways, regulatory mechanisms, pharmaceutical structures and activities,
            patient response data, etc., have created many opportunities for intelligent
            systems.  
 At UCI, current areas of research in bio/medical informatics include:   Medical Information Access
                  Knowledge Representation for Health-Care Guidelines
                  Structure in Biomedical Data
                  Biomedical Simulations
                  Discovery of Gene Expression Control
                  Knowledge Discovery in Clinical Databases
                  Computational Biology
                  Bioinformatics and Probabilistic Modeling.
