   Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization . 
D. Eppstein.  Tech. Rep. 95-11 , ICS, UCI, 1995.   27th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing,  Las Vegas, 1995, pp. 662–671 .   Disc. Comp. Geom.  20: 463–476, 1998 .
 
Considers graphs in which edge weights are linear functions of time.
Shows nonlinear lower bounds on the number of different
 minimum spanning trees  appearing
over time by translation from geometric problem of lower envelopes of line segments.
A matroid generalization has a better lower bound coming from many faces
in line arrangements, and the uniform matroid problem is
equivalent to the geometric  k -set problem.
