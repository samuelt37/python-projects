                                  WICS Committee applications are now open!</strong> 
  Apply  here .</strong> 
 Committee members gain important skills in  networking</strong>,  planning</strong>, and  management</strong>, and interact frequently with company representatives during the planning process.  This is also an incredible  resume builder</strong> and demonstrates  leadership</strong> and  initiative</strong> to future employers or graduate programs. 
 Our committee is a   3 hour+ commitment</strong> per week including committee meetings and some outside work, and will require more time in the weeks before the events.  Committee members are required to attend WICS events to understand how the organization works, with the exception of classes overlapping with events.  Our main events are: 
 –  Mock Technical Interviews</strong> in the Winter quarter that involves having mock technical interviews with real company engineers. 
 – Orange County  Women in Computing Conference –  init(Together) </strong> for female CS students in local universities, community and state colleges.  This involves a keynote speaker, panels, a career fair, and a social event. 
 – A  series of workshops </strong>for general WICS members to provide knowledge and hands on experience about topics that are not taught in detail in class such as making apps and websites. 
 –  Give back to the community</strong> for girls in local elementary/middle/high schools.  WICS volunteers will teach girls Computer Science and/or engineering concepts via different methods such as littleBits and app jams.
