 Quadratic Growth 

 It seems likely, but very difficult to prove, that chaotic regions in
B35/S236 tend to grow quadratically. In life, quadratic growth can
instead be achieved by "breeders", puffer train convoys that lay out a
linear sequence of  glider guns .  In B35/S236,
also, breeders exist.  I used to not know of any  puffer trains , so instead I formed the following
breeder out of "tethered rakes": fixed gun emplacements which send out
glider salvos towards a slower (c/3)  spaceship , forming sideways gliders which meet to
make the sequence of guns. The only technical complication is that the
gun sequence ends up between the tethers, so the gliders need to be
timed to pass through the tethers unharmed. 

     

 (Note: this breeder was developed before I found the  three-glider p68 synthesis , or the  7x7 c/3 spaceship , and could likely be somewhat
simplified by using both of these newer ideas.)
