						     Judith Gregory presents at the Moving Genomics from Bench to Bedside workshop, Vancouver, BC.  
 EVOKE members  Matthew Bietz  and  Judith Gregory  were recently invited to speak at the  Moving Genomics Research from Bench to Bedside: Science, Technology &amp; Society Perspectives  workshop on May 24, 2013. The workshop was hosted by  Ellen Balka  in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University, with additional support from the  Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research  and  Genome BC . The workshop provided a wonderful opportunity to discuss clinical, legal, ethical, theoretical and infrastructural aspects of bringing genomics into clinical and personal health practices. 
 Bietz presented on his work with the  Genomic Standards Consortium , a community standards development organization focusing on developing common formats for data production, description, analysis and exchange. Gregory presented on “The Quantified Self and Personal Genomics,” exploring the challenges and opportunities around personal genomic testing, self-tracking, and sharing personal data to create a public good.
