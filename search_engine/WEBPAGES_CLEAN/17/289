 Emily Navarro<body>  Assignment 3, Part 1: Design Patterns    Due date: February 10th 5:00pm   Informatics 122  Software Design II  Winter 2015  Professor Emily Navarro      Description  
Improve the design of your implemented MakeAGraph by replacing existing structures in the code with appropriate patterns. You should apply at least 3 patterns, including at least one  not  discussed in class. Each use of a pattern should be carefully motivated in a brief accompanying document.      Deliverables  
Each individual must turn in:  1. A printed copy of their restructured code (just the classes/places where it was modified to apply patterns). Please highlight the lines that were changed.  2. A printed document describing:   	 * The motivation for each pattern   	 * The impact the application of each pattern has on the design (i.e., how far reaching is the change to incorporate the pattern?)      Grading  
You will be graded on three things for Assignment 3-1:  1. Usefulness of the patterns  2. Rationale  3. Level of design understanding shown in your patterns and rationale      Important: Part 2 of this assignment will be given on Thursday (2/5), and will also be due February 10th, so start now!  </body>
