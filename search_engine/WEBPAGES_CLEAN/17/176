 M. T. Goodrich .  arXiv:cs.CG/0307027 .  20th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Brooklyn, 2004, pp. 144–151.   ACM Trans. Algorithms  3(2):A16, 2007 .
 
We describe an efficient streaming-model construction of epsilon-nets
and epsilon-approximations, and use it to find deterministic streaming-model
approximation algorithms for iceberg range queries and for various
robust statistics problems.

    The effect of faults on network expansion.   A. Bagchi ,
 A. Bhargava ,
 A. Chaudhary ,
D. Eppstein, and
 C. Scheideler .  arXiv:cs.DC/0404029 .   16th ACM
Symp. Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures ,

Computing Systems  39 (6): 903–928, 2006 .
 
Studies the resilience of distributed computation networks against
adversarial and random fault models; shows that, in both models,
certain networks can withstand constant fault probabilities and
still contain a large subnetwork with similar expansion to the original.
