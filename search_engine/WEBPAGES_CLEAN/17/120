 Simple Sample HTML -- Title<body>

 Simple Sample HTML -- Heading 
 
``HTML'' means ``Hypertext Markup Language.''
   Item one has an   anchor 
  Item two of this Unordered List does not.
     This is the first item of an Ordered List.
  Such lists are numbered.
    Paragraphs are bounded by &lt;P&gt; at the start and (optionally)
&lt;/P&gt; at the end. 
 Of course, lots of folks just begin paragraphs and don't
worry about ending the previous one.  That's fine.  It works.
Part of why/how it works is that lots of things in effect
end paragraphs.  Things like lists and ``Horizontal Rules.''
Here ``Rule'' just means a straight line as one sees below.
    The general format of bounding something by &lt;XXX&gt; at the start and
&lt;/XXX&gt; at the end works for setting physical styles of print as well:
    XXX = B for Bold 
   XXX = I for Italic 
   XXX = TT for fixed width ``TeleTypewriter'' 
     Much more information  about HTML is available.
