 Feel free to add (anonymous or signed) comments about lecture, homework, etc.  Please remain polite.  I reserve the right to moderate and remove posts.  Posts must be made from UCI machines.  For anonymous posts, just use any name (like, "anonymous").

 Could you please explain how I could plot
regression functions sampled from the posterior distribution?
  The L2 regularization arises from a Gaussian prior on the coefficient values.  First, compute the posterior distribution over coefficients.  Drawing a sample from this distribution yields a vector of coefficients, which defines a possible predictive function, e.g.: 
  [w0 w1 w2] ~ N( w ; m_n, S_n)   =&gt;  yhat = w0 + w1x1 + w2 x2 
  This is a sample regression function, and can be plotted.

 About the Midterm, is it possible for us to have certain sample question like the midterm last year? Or the midterm would be just like the homework?
   Sorry for not responding in time.  As you saw, the midterm is much like the HWs: 2 questions were similar to HW problems, and the last was something we had done in lecture.

 Congratulations to Professor Ihler, and best wishes to little boy Bobby Ihler.
   Thanks!

 Oh, Yes, thank you very much. I also solved it last night. {0,1} would make the part (a)--find the probability of p(x=1|sita) meaningful!

 Question about HWK 1 Problem 3:Should it be X belong to (0,1), because {0,1} is only a set with two elements 0 and 1?
   No, {0,1} is correct -- X is binary valued.  Thus, enumerating the sum is easy to do.  I'll give an example in class today or Monday.
