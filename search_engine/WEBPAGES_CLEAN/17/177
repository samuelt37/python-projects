 Menu length and item order<body>
    Guidelines for menu length and 
item order in linear menus     
       For beginners, 
menus should be kept short. If item names are longer than one word, menus should 
not contain more than 5-8 items.       Longer 
menus are possible if items are grouped or have a natural sequence (numbers, dates, 
etc.)       Items 
should be grouped according to rules of the task domain, and separated by whitespace 
or horizontal lines (Parkinson et al., 1985).       For 
beginners: menu items that will be frequently used by most users should go to 
the top of the menu             
  If multiple selections are possible, 
then frequently-selected combinations of items should be kept closely together 
(or otherwise increased in size)        
     "Dangerous" items should 
not be collocated with frequently used items.       (As 
a final rule): use alphabetic, chronological or numerical order, or group according 
to similarity of items (e.g., position "save as" next to "save")         
  Possibly use pie menus, which are superior 
to pull-down menus for beginners.            </body>
