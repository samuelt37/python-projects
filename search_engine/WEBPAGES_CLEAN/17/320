 CREATE (cont�d)<body>

  CREATE (cont�d)  
      CREATE can be thought of as a check-in
 
     CREATE makes a new internal member resource within the version history collection specified by Request-URI
 
     The body of the CREATE request is PUT to the new member of the collection
 
     If the version history graph is empty, the Root property is set to the new resource
