   Use Clause

            Syntax        
  

 
     use library_name.primary_unit_name;        use library_name.primary_unit_name.item;      
  



 
See LRM section 10.4

         Rules and Examples        
  

 
    The use clause must appear before the start of the design unit
itself. If the unit to be used is not in the library  work , it
must be preceded by a  library  clause:
 library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.all;
entity WIDGET is

-- etc.

end WIDGET;  
    
  

 
    The use clause is valid only for the design unit immediately
following it in the design file. However it also automatically applies
to any secondary units associated with primary units for which it is
valid. 
    
  

 
    Where multiple primary design units in the same design file need to
use the same items, the use clause(s) must be repeated before each unit.
 
    
  

 
    The last field in a use clause may be replaced by  all  to
access all items in a design unit, or all design unitsin a library:
 library MY_LIB;
use MY_LIB.MY_PACK.all;  
    
  

 
    The shorter form of the use clause may appear in a configuration, to
select which library entities are selected from:
 library ASIC_LIB;
configuration ASIC_TECH of ENT is
  for GATE_ARCH
    use ASIC_LIB.all;
  end for;
end ASIC_TECH;  
    
  

 
    The shorter form of the use clause may also appear in the
declarative part of an entity, architecture or block. 
    
  



 
         Synthesis Issues        
  

 
    The use clause is usually supported by synthesis tools, but design
libraries are often not.
 
Design files corresponding to any design units referenced by a use
clause must be analysed before the design units referencing them can be
synthesised.
  
    
  



 
         Whats New in '93        

The use clause has not changed in  VHDL -93.
