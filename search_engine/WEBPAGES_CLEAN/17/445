   Spambase Database 
  Donated by George Forman (gforman at nospam hpl.hp.com)  650-857-7835  Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber and Jaap Suermondt.
	   Number of Instances: 4601 (1813 Spam = 39.4%)
	   Number of Attributes: 58 (57 continuous, 1 nominal class label)
	   The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web
        sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...
	Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and 
	individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam 
	e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence
	the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of 
	non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized 
	spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam 
	indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to 
	generate a general purpose spam filter.
