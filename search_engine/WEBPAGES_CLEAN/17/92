   Algorithms for drawing media.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.DS/0406020 .  12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , New York, 2004. 
Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  3383, 2004, pp. 173â€“183.
 
We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
 partial cubes :
one based on
 finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph  and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.
  
Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book  Media Theory , making journal publication moot.
