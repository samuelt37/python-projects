Shows both theoretically and experimentally that the number of times a
random line crosses a road network is asymptotically upper bounded by
the square root of the number of road segments.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of
subgraph there are in a larger undirected graph, when the subgraphs have
at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.
  
    Category-based routing in social networks: membership dimension and the small-world phenomenon . 
D. Eppstein,

 M. Löffler ,
 D. Strash , and
 L. Trott .  Workshop on Graph Algorithms and Applications , Zürich,
Switzerland, July 2011.  International Conference on Computational
Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN 2011) , Salamanca, Spain, October
2011.  arXiv:1108.4675 .   Theor. Comput. Sci.  514: 96–104, 2013 . (Special issue on Graph
Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)  
We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.
  
    Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling .  M. J. Bannister ,
D. Eppstein,
 M. T. Goodrich , and
 L. Trott .  arXiv:1209.0748 .  20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing , Redmond, Washington, 2012.  Springer,  Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.  7704, 2013, pp. 414–425 .  
We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.
