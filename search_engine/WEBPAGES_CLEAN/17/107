						  The BCube project is part of the wider  EarthCube  suite of projects.   Steven Slota, working with Geoffrey C. Bowker is working with the design team for a ‘knowledge broker’ permitting transfer of information across the multiple sciences that make up the field of earth system dynamics.  We are analysing social and cultural factors in data/information exchange.  For Slota, this work is part of the more important general question – an aspect of our knowledge infrastructures emphasis – of the relationship between scientific knowledge production and policy outcomes.
