                        The  MotifMap  system provides comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory elements encoded in the genomes of model species using databases of transcription factor binding motifs, 
                        refined genome alignments, and a comparative genomic statistical approach-

                                   allows users to select a genomic loci (e.g. a SNP) and search for
                                   overlapping or neighbouring transcription factor binding sites.                                     
                                  
                                
                                 In all cases, users can filter the results by various criteria and export them to severals file formats or view them directly in the UCSC genome browser.
