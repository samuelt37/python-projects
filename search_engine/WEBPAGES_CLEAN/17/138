void OEMDLPerceiveParity(OEMolBase &amp;mol)
    
This function sets the MDL stereo parity information for each atom
from the OEChem stereochemistry.  Any atom that has tetrahedral stereo
specified, has the appropriate value, one or two, placed in its
``MDLParity'' generic data, with type ``unsigned int''.  This MDL stereo
parity is relative to the current order of atoms returned by an
iterator of atoms across a molecule.  All other atoms, non-chiral or
without stereo specified, have their MDL stereo parity set to zero.

  
 OEMDLPercieveParity  internally calls the  OEPerceiveChiral 
function, so there's no need to explicitly call  OEPerceiveChiral 
on a molecule prior to calling  OEMDLPercieveParity .

  
This function is the opposite of the  OEMDLStereoFromParity  function.
