Reducing the Space Requirements of an Ordered Set
 
Josiah Carlson
 
 
In recent years there have been various papers that provide
algorithms to store sets in a compressed fashion.  This presentation
will cover a paper by Blandford and Blelloch that provides a method
for
representing an ordered set within a constant factor of the
theoretical
lower bound.  While not improving significantly on previous space
bounds,
it does provide a larger set of useful functionality over previous
compressed set storage methods.
