              Abstract   

One popular and efficient scheme for solving exactly combinatorial
optimization problems over graphical models is 
depth-first Branch and Bound. However, when the algorithm exploits
problem decomposition using AND/OR search spaces, its anytime behavior
breaks down. This paper 1) analyzes and demonstrates this inherent
conflict between effective exploitation of problem decomposition
(through AND/OR search spaces) and the anytime behavior of depth-first
search (DFS), 2) presents a first scheme to address this issue while
maintaining desirable DFS memory properties, 3) analyzes and
demonstrates its effectiveness. Our work is applicable to any problem
that can be cast as search over an AND/OR search space.
