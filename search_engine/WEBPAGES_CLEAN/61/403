15.16.4 flush 
 
   
bool flush()
    
Flushes the remaining data in the output buffer onto the stream and returns
whether or not it was successful. Explicit calls to this function are only
necessary when one needs to make sure that all of the data that has been
stored in the output buffer is actually on the output stream at that time.
The output buffer is automatically flushed when it becomes full.
