  CGAL::Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3&lt;FK&gt;  
 

  Definition 
 

The class   Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3 &lt;FK&gt;  is designed as a traits class for the
class   Regular_triangulation_3 &lt; RegularTriangulationTraits_3 , TriangulationDataStructure_3 &gt; . 
Its difference with   Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3   is that it
provides filtered predicates which are meant to be fast and exact.
  

The first argument  FK  must be a model of the   Kernel   concept, and
it is also restricted to be a instance of the   Filtered_kernel   template.
  

 #include &lt; CGAL/Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3.h &gt; 
  

  Is Model for the Concept   RegularTriangulationTraits_3  
 

  Inherits From   Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3 &lt;FK&gt;
