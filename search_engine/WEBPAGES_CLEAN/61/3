  Simple kernel to calculate similarity between pairs of strings. 
  Similarity is based on the number of "k-mers" in common between
  the two strings.  That is, all substrings of length k. 
   Conceptually, a feature vector of all possible k-mers is created for 
  each string and has counts assigned to the elements for each respective 
  k-mer that exists in the string.  The dot-product between these two 
  vectors is then taken as the similarity score. 
  This is a very large vector of length (n^k) where n is the number of 
  letters in the "alphabet" of the string.  That is, the number 
  of possible distinct characters the string can contain.  This is a sparse
  vector, mostly 0's, thus actual such arrays are not used to represent 
  these arrays.  Instead, a "feature dictionary" containing only 
  found k-mers and their counts is created.

      (Constructor) 
   
     
     
    
  
  Constructor.  Takes the value k as an argument to specify the length 
  of the "k-mer" substrings to find in common.
        
  
 
   
     
     similarity ( self ,

  Primary abstract method where, given two objects, should return an 
  appropriate, non-negative, similarity score between the two.  Up to the 
  implementing class to define what this is.
