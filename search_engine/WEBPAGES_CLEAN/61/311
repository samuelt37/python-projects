              Abstract   
	  Best-first search can be regarded as an anytime scheme
	  for producing lower bounds on the optimal solution, a characteristic
	  that is mostly overlooked. In this paper we explore this topic in
	  the context of AND/OR best-first search, guided by the mini-bucket
	  heuristic, when solving graphical models. In that context, the impact
	  of the secondary heuristic for subproblem ordering becomes apparent,
	  especially when viewed in the anytime context. Specifically, we
	  show how the concept of bucket errors, introduced recently, can yield
	  effective subproblem orderings in AND/OR search and that it is often
	  superior to the baseline approach which uses the same heuristic
	  for node selection (OR nodes) and for subproblem orderings (AND
	  nodes). Our experiments show an improvement in performance both
	  for proving optimality and also in the anytime performance.
