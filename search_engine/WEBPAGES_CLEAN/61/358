bool set(oeostream *osptr, bool del)
    
Sets  osptr  to be the stream wrapped by this class. If  del  is
true, the wrapped stream will be deleted when the  clear  method is
called or when this class is deleted. It is important to understand that by
setting  del  to true, ownership of the stream's memory is transfered to
this class, and if it is false, you retain the responsibility for managing
the stream's memory.
