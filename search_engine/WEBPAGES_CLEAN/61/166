  Replicators : B34/S0235 

This replicator repeats every four generations,
on a one-dimensional 2-unit grid.

       

No spaceships are known; finding some is probably 
the highest priority for research on this rule.
It would also be of interest to find a way of capping a row of replicators
to make high-period oscillators.

 The same replicator works in 15 other rules of the form B34xx/S0235.
Of these, only
 B347/S0235 
and
 B348/S0235 
have known spaceships.
