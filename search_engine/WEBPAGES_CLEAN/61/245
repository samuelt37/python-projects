bool AddConstraint(const OEMatchPair&lt;OEAtomBase&gt; &amp;ac)
bool AddConstraint(const OEMatchPair&lt;OEBondBase&gt; &amp;bc)
    
The search space of a subgraph isomorphism determination can be
restricted by constraining pairs of nodes or edges (atoms or bonds) to
be mapped onto one another in all valid subgraph solutions.  Failure
to satisfy atom or bond pairwise constraints will prevent any subgraph
solutions from being identified by any of the match methods in
OESubSearch.  Both AddConstraint methods return true if a constraint
is added successfully.  If the pattern atom or bond in the OEMatchPair
does not exist as part of the query molecule created in the
initialization of the OESubSearch object then AddConstraint will
return false.  Multiple calls to AddConstraint using the same pattern
atom or bond will cause previously stored constraints to be
overwritten as constraints are mutually exclusive.  It is impossible
to satisfy multiple simultaneous constraints for a single pattern atom
or bond, hence the exclusivity.
