         Waging war with no bombs or missiles


</strong>
           By Gary Robbins</strong>    
    
                    
“Cyberspace is the Wild West. There is no consensus over how nations should behave in using cyber weapons,” said  Bryan Cunningham</strong>, the former CIA officer who heads UC Irvine’s new Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute.

  
“There's no treaty that specifies what cyber activities rise to the level of armed aggression warranting a response. No one knows where the lines are, and that's a dangerous situation. An adversary could miscalculate, taking an offensive cyber action thinking it’s below the threshold for response. But the victim nation sees it differently, triggering a much larger cyber or kinetic war than intended by the attacker."
