   Data Set Information:  
 Ross Quinlan:  This data was given to me by Karl Ulrich at MIT in 1986.  I didn't record his description at the time, but here's his subsequent (1992) recollection:  "I seem to remember that the data was from a simulation of a servo system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a sliding carriage of some sort.  It may have been on of the translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab.  In any case, the output value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set point."  (Quinlan, ML'93)  "This is an interesting collection of data provided by Karl Ulrich.  It covers an extremely non-linear phenomenon - predicting the rise time of a servomechanism in terms of two (continuous) gain settings and two (discrete) choices of mechanical linkages." 

   Attribute Information:  
    1. motor: A,B,C,D,E    2. screw: A,B,C,D,E    3. pgain: 3,4,5,6    4. vgain: 1,2,3,4,5    5. class: 0.13 to 7.10
