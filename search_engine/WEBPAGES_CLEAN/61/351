    Behavior 

    Behavior determines how an object interacts with other objects  how it acts on other objects  how it reacts to requests from other objects  Requests are made by message-passing  Responding to a request may change the objectï¿½s state    The behavior of an object is completely defined by its actions or operations  Behavior can cause a state change  If my Car is in the state Operational, a Breakdown operation will cause its state to change to Stalled  Withdrawing from an Account may change its state to Overdrawn
