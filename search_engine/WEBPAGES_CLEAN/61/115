bool SetExplicitHydrogens(bool)
    
This variable sets the hydrogen handling mode for the
 OELibraryGen  instance.   OELibraryGen  instance are
constructed by default with the explicit hydrogen mode set to true.
Reactions may be executed using either implicit or explicit hydrogens
represented in the starting materials for a reaction.  If the value is
true, the  OELibraryGen  instance will add explicit hydrogens to
reactant molecules when they are initialized using either of the
 SetStartingMaterial  methods.  If the value is false, then both of the
 SetStartingMaterial  methods will suppress any explict hydrogens in the
reactant molecules, and simply retain the implicit hydrogen counts for
remaining non-hydrogen atoms.  The hydrogen handling mode must be
assigned prior to calling  SetStartingMaterial .  Calling
 SetExplicitHydrogens  after  SetStartingMaterial  will have not
effect.
