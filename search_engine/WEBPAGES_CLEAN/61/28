					 Norma is currently visiting UCI from Germany, where she is pursuing a PhD in sociology at Potsdam University. Her research interests include the social study of information and surveillance technology. She is specifically interested in what surveillance technologies can tell us about the intersections of science, technology and politics. For her doctoral dissertation, she is writing an ethnography of the development of a “smart” video surveillance system. 
Prior to coming to Irvine, Norma studied “languages, cultural and business studies” at Passau University, Germany, and sociology at Sapienza University, Rome. She has also worked as a research fellow with the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research project “Sociological Perspectives on Pattern Recognition and Video Tracking” at Potsdam University, Germany.
