  Enter WebDAV  
      WebDAV makes the Web a writeable, collaborative medium by supporting:
 
  Remote editing: software development artifacts can be modified from anywhere in the world
  Collaboration: can work on artifacts with other people without losing changes
  Namespace management: copy and move operations support maintenance of the names of software development artifacts
  Metadata: properties allow information about artifacts to be stored with, but separate to the artifact
