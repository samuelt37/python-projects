  Replicators : B01367/S0124 

 In  
B01367/S0124 , the following pattern replicates itself every 8
steps. The replicated copies are oriented at right angles to the
original pattern, so as the pattern continues to expand it fills
out a diamond pattern the corners of which move at speed c/2. 

     

 With random initial conditions this rule remains formless and chaotic.
