  Astronomy 

Computational geometry problems arise in astronomy in observation planning,
shape reconstruction for irregular bodies such as asteroids,
clustering for galaxy distribution analysis, and
 hierarchical decomposition  of point sets for
n-body simulations.
     Applications
of the linear quadtree to astronomical databases , P. Barrett, NASA.
Encoding astronomical coordinates with quadtrees can provide significant
improvements in efficiency when accessing sources near a given direction
and can aid in the correlation of positions from different astronomical
catalogs.
