 Abstract  
The paper presents an algorithm called directional resolution, avariation on the
original Davis-Putnam algorithm, and analyzes its worst-case behavior as a function of
the topological structure of propositional theories. The concepts of induced width and
diversity are shown to play a key role in bounding the complexity of the procedure.
The importance of our analysis lies in highlighting structure-based tractable classes of
satisfiability and in providing theoretical guarantees on the time and space complexity
of the algorithm. Contrary to previous assessments, we show that for many theories
directional resolution could be an effective procedure. Our empirical tests confirm
theoretical prediction, showing that on problems with a special structure, namely k-tree
embeddings (e.g. chains, (k,m)-trees), directional resolution greatly outperforms one of
the most effective satisfiability algorithms known to date, the popular Davis-Putnam
procedure. Furthermore, combining a bounded version of directional resolution with
the Davis-Putnam procedure results in an algorithm superior to either components.
