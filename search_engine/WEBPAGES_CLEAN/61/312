 Retrieving properties<body>

  Retrieving properties  
      At present, spec. defines a method called SEARCH which performs a limited search of the properties defined on a resource, and can search on the name and the value.
 
     Pro: allows retrieval of only specific properties
 
     Con: there is no way to specify a set of resources on which to perform the search -- cannot easy search a whole server (however, specifying a full-power search is really hard, and is out of scope)
 
  search is an expensive operation
