  Views  

 Conceptually, a view is a pairing of a  viewer 
and an  object . A view can only be created if
the viewer supports the MIME type of the object. Typically, a view will
manifest as a graphical depiction of the object on the user's display. For
instance, below is a view of a JPEG file as presented by an image program. 

     

 These views will be found within a viewer's window, and the viewer will
provide access to hypermedia services via some form of user-interface widget.
For instance, the viewer might create a pull-down menu containing commands
such as  Create_Anchor  or  Traverse_Link , or these
commands may be presented as a pop-up menu on the view itself. Alternatively,
the viewer may hide specific access to commands from the user, and instead
invoke hypermedia commands based on a user's actions within the view. For
instance, drawing a rectangle on an image can automatically create an  anchor  which represents the rectangle within Chimera's
 hyperweb .
