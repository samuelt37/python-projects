 ICS 269, Winter 1996: Theory Seminar 

  8 March 1996: 
Fairly Recent Results about Triangulations  Brad Hutchings , ICS, UC Irvine 

Brad will discuss two fairly recent results about triangulations.
The first result is the Subgraph Theorem from "A Quadratic Time
Algorithm for the MinMax Triangulation" by Edelsbrunner and Tan
[ SIAM J. Comput. , vol. 22, 1993, pp. 527-551]. The second
result is an improved beta for the beta-skeleton subgraph of the
minimum weight triangulation. This result appeared in the paper "A
better subgraph of the minimum weight triangulation" by Yang
[ IPL , vol. 56, 1995, pp. 255-258]. 

 During his talk, Brad will be using his new graph algorithm
visualization application to compute and display results from these
papers on random graphs.
