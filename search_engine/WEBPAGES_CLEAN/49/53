ICS 160E / EECS 114 - Algorithms Assignments 

 
  
Spring, 2005
 
 

 
 Notes:  
   Group work on written homeworks is permitted, but each
student  must  list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
  
Programming projects must be 100%  individual  efforts.
Submitted code will be subjected to a rigorous similarity checking
system at UC-Berkeley, 
known as  MOSS ,
and non-negligible similarities between different student submissions
will be considered as cheating for both students (so don't even show
your code to other students).
In addition to the procedures of the
 ICS 
Cheating Policy , students caught cheating on programming projects
will have
a letter placed in their permanent record at UCI
and, at a minimum, receive a score of zero points on the work in question.
