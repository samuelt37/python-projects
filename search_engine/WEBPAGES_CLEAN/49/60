   1.6 Port Numbers 
  
     n    TCP and UDP use     port     numbers to identify the       application.    
     n    The port numbers are     16 bits.    
     n    Servers     are assigned     well known     port numbers,       e.g., FTP is assigned TCP port number 21, telnet       is assigned TCP port number 23.     
     n    These port numbers are assigned by the Internet       Assigned Numbers Authority (    IANA    ).    
     n    Ports 1 to 1023 are all well known (listed in       /etc/services).     
     n    Clients     are allocated     ephemeral     port numbers       between 1024 and 5000. They are short lived.
