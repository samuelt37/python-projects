                                  On Monday, October 19, WICS held a social night of board games and movies for 34 students with lots of snacks and drinks. WICS members watched Beetlejuice while playing games like Werewolf and UNO. It was a great way to return to WICS meetings after attending the Grace Hopper Conference Celebration of Women in Computing for the previous week. With midterms coming up members were able to take sometime away and relax with each other. We hope everyone had a great time!
