Please also check   your recorded scores... I've sent email with the details.  [November 25, 2002] I've granted an extension to the due date on the implemenation   assignment, but at the penalty of reducing the maximum possible score for that   assignment from 7 to 5. Details are in the email sent to the course mailing   list. There will NOT be an extension granted for the testing assignment.   [October 3, 2002] You can find some very helpful guidelines for the composition   of good email messages  here ,   courtesy of Ellen Strenski in the UCI writing program.  [September 29, 2002] Would you like to add this class? So would about 110 other   people (literally). The room capacity is 190. Currently there are 175 people   enrolled. I will therefore sign in a total of 15 people.  Priority will   be given as follows</strong>: (A) ICS majors who are seniors; (B) non-ICS majors   who are both seniors and ICS minors; (C) ICS majors who are juniors. Before   I sign an add card you must complete, sign, and return to me  this   form  no later than Wednesday, October 2nd. Give me the form, a filled in   add card, and I will process the submissions. Signed add cards will be available   Friday, October 4th, from my office (in the bin on the outside of my door).     Overview  | Textbooks  | Schedule  | Assignments  | TAs  | Keeping in Touch  | Computing  | Disabilities  |   Academic Dishonesty  |     Instructor    Professor   Richard N.

Midterm: 20%.   Final: 35%   The project consists of four assignments. Their relative weighting ( as   a percentage of your final grade ) is as follows:              Assignment        Weight </strong>            Requirements         10         Architecture and module         interfaces  (assignment)         Official Requirements Document         18          Implementation          assignment         Official Design Document         7        Testing  assignment       10   </strong></strong>     Specific assignments will be placed on the web, giving the assignment, the   required format, and specific grading criteria.   We do not grade on a curve, meaning that we will not assert in advance thathalf of the class will receive grades at or below a C+, and half above that.Grading is done based on mastery of the material as exhibited in the examsand the project.  If everyone masters the material very well, then everyonewill get an A. On the other hand, if no one were to master the materialat all adequately, then everyone would receive an F.  NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED, unless you have a legible excuse from aphysician, an extreme family emergency, or unless you are willing toaccept an extreme penalty with respect to your assignment's grade.        Teaching Assistant and Readers   TA:  Girish Suryanarayana             Readers:       TBD              Keeping in Touch   Check this web site regularly. This is the definitive location for course information.   Announcements concerning assignments will be made here. The course mailing list   will also be used to make announcements, provide instructions, and so on. The   course mailing list will be "read only" from the student's perspective.   I.e. the instructor, TA, and readers can post messages to the list,but not students.   If you ask one of us a question whose answer is relevant to the rest of the   class, we'll post the appropriate material to the list.  An important note about email   Any email that you send in conjunction with this class   must be sent from a UCI account. That is, if you want any response or action   taken, then you must use your UCI account to send the email. Email from yahoo,   hotmail, juno, cox, or any other non-UCI site will be ignored.       Computing    All computing will be done on the department's NT machines.   You may use another computer to produce the documents you turn in. ( No    handwritten assignments allowed).   All implementation work will be done in Java.  Please use the computing equipment or instructional purposes only.Also watch out on the social subtleties of electronic mail.     Disabilities  Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact  of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific  needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soonaspossible to better ensure that such accommodations are implementationedina timely fashion.      Academic Dishonesty  Cheating in ICS 52 will be punished in accordance with  University policy  and   ICS policy.  Please familiarize yourself with those documents. Note that University policy states that faculty have the responsibility of "assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty." That appropriate grade, for this class, is an F. Cheating is wrong. It is lying. Don't do it.      Department of Information and Computer Science ,  University of California, Irvine CA 92697-3425 </body>
