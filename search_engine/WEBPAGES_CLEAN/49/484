Welcome to the mailing list for the Working Group on Versioning and
Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content!  If you are receiving
this mail, it is because you have previously indicated an interest in
discussing issues related to versioning and configuration management on the
WWW.  If you would like to be removed from this list, please send email to
&lt;www-vers-wg-request&gt;.  Conversely, &lt;www-vers-wg-request&gt; is also the
address for requests to be added to the list.

While this should probably be our first item of discussion, my view of the
purpose of this group is as follows:

The purpose of this working group is to develop a preliminary specification
for how to provide versioning and configuration management of content
served by an HTTP server.  It is intented that once this preliminary
specification becomes stable, it will be presented to an appropriate forum
(most likely the IETF HTTP Working Group, and publication as a W3C
technical report) for further discussion, refinement, and eventual
integration into appropriate internet standards.

It is intended that this working group will cooperate with efforts to
develop proposed standards to foster interoperability between distributed
web content authoring tools.  The issue of versioning and configuration
management of web content is considered to be an important aspect of the
larger effort to ensure interoperability between these HTTP write-capabable
tools.

You can find this declaration of purpose, along with much other background
information at a web site established for this group:

I'd like to thank Larry Masinter and Dan Connolly for pointing me in the
direction of the majority of the content on this page.  I consider this
page to be a work-in-progress, so please let me know if you think I should
add a link, or some extra information.  I'm learning about new efforts in
the area of WWW versioning and CM support constantly, and I'm sure you are
too.  Please pass along what you know so I can make it available to all.

People are always curious to know who is on a mailing list, so I list below
the current members of this list.  If you know of anyone else who is
interested in this topic and would like to be added to the list, please
pass their name along to me.  Thanks!
