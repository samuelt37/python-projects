Let  P  be a set and
 ⊑  be a
(partial)  order  on  P . 
Then  P  and  ⊑ 
form a  (partially) ordered set . 
 

 
If the order is  total ,
so that no two elements of  P  are
 incomparable ,
then the ordered set is a  totally ordered set . 
Totally ordered sets are the ones people are first familiar with. 
See  Figure 1  for an example. 
 

 
A  totally ordered set 
is also termed a  chain . 
 

 
If the order is  partial ,
so that  P  has two or more
 incomparable  elements,
then the ordered set is a
 partially ordered set . 
See  Figure 2  for an example. 
 

 
At the other extreme,
if no two elements are comparable unless they are equal,
then the ordered set is an  antichain . 
See  Figure 3 . 
 

 
On any set, = is an order;
this is termed the  discrete order  on the set. 
Any set ordered by = forms an  antichain . 
 

 
It is common for people to refer briefly though inaccurately
to an ordered set as an  order ,
to a totally ordered set as a  total order ,
and
to a partially ordered set as a  partial order . 
It is usually clear by context whether "order"
refers literally to an  order 
(an order relation)
or by  synecdoche  to
an  ordered set . 
 


 
Examples: 
 
   The integers with ≤ form an ordered set
    (see  Figure 1 ). 
    ≤ is a  total order  on the integers,
    so this ordered set is a  chain . 
   
    Any  powerset 
    with  ⊆ 
    forms an ordered set (see  Figure 2 ). 
    This is a partially ordered set because
    not all subsets are related by  ⊆ ,
    for example { a } || { b ,  r }. 
   
    A set of unrelated items,
    ordered by =,
    is the  discrete order  on that set
    and forms an  antichain 
    (see  Figure 3 ). 
   
    The classes in java.util with the subclass relation
    form an ordered set (see  Figure 4 ). 
    This set is partially ordered,
    because not all classes in the set
    are related by the subclass relations
    (for example, Vector and HashSet
    are not related and are thus
     incomparable : 
    Vector || HashSet). 
   
    A set of  binary strings 
    with the prefix relation
    forms an ordered set (see  Figure 5 ). 
    This is set is partially ordered because
    not all strings are related by the prefix relation,
    for example 01 || 10. 
   
    The (non-empty) conjunctions of any of the propositions
     p ,  q , and
     r ,
    ordered by implication,
    form an ordered set (see  Figure 6 ). 
    In this set,
     p ∧ q  implies
     q ,
    but  p ∧ q 
    neither implies nor is implied by
     q ∧ r ,
    so  p ∧ q  and
     q ∧ r  are
     incomparable 
    ( p ∧ q  #  q ∧ r )
    . 
   
    The positive integers  N 
    with the divisibility relation
    form an ordered set. 
    The divisibility relation relates  m  to
     n 
    if  m  divides  n ,
    written  m  |  n . 
    Thus 2 | 6, and 3 | 6 but not 4 | 6
    (i.e., 4 and 6 are  incomparable ,
    written 4 || 6) because 4 does not divide 6. 
    And for any  n  ∈  N ,
    1 |  n 
    and
     n  |  n . 
    A part of this ordered set is shown in  Figure 7 .

 Duality 


 
  Figure 8
 The dual of the ordered set in  Figure 7 
 
 


 
Each ordered set  P  corresponds to
another ordered set  P ∂  ,
the  dual  of  P ,
defined by: 

y ⊑ x
in  P ∂  
iff
x ⊑ y
in  P . 
 

 
Each statement  Φ  about  P 
corresponds to a  dual statement 
 Φ  ∂ 
about  P  ∂ . 
 Φ  ∂  is obtained by replacing
each occurrence of
 ⊑  in  Φ 
by  ⊒ ,
and
each occurrence of
 ⊒  in  Φ 
by  ⊑ . 
 Φ  is true about  P  if and only if
 Φ  ∂  is true
about  P  ∂ . 
Generalizing,
it can be shown that
if a statement  Φ  is true about all ordered sets,
then its dual statement   Φ  ∂   is also true. 
This assertion is the  Duality Principle . 
 

 
Pairs of dual concepts that are defined in terms of
 ⊑  and
 ⊒ 
(such as  upper bound  and
 lower bound , below),
are also exchanged in dual statements. 
 

 
Example: 
Let  Q  be the ordered set
shown in  Figure 7 ,
in which
 ⊑  is
the integer  divides  relation,
with the divisor "lower than" the dividend. 
Then the ordered set of the positive integers to 15
ordered by the  converse  of  divides 
(now with the divisor considered "higher" than the dividend),
is the dual  Q  ∂ 
of  Q . 
The converse of |, | -1 ,
relates two integers if one divides the other,
but unlike | it classifies the numerically-smaller integer
as the "higher" one by this relation,
so that for this order
2 ⊑ 1,
for example. 
 Q  ∂ 
is shown in  Figure 8 . 
In  Q ,
4 ⊑ 8,
so we know without looking at  Figure 8  that
in  Q  ∂ ,
the  dual statement 
4 ⊒ 8
holds in the relation for that ordered set. 
 


 Extrema 

 
Let  S  be an ordered set. 
 

  
     u  ∈  S  is said to be
     maximal  in  S  iff
    there is no  v  ∈  S  such that
     u ≤ v . 
    A set may have any number of maximal elements, including zero. 
   
   
    If  u  is  S 's only maximal element,
    then  u  is the  maximum  of
     S . 
   
   
    The maximum element  u  (if it exists) is also called
    the  top  of  S 
    and is denoted by ⊤. 
   
   
    Dually,
     t  ∈  S  is said to be  minimal  in  S  iff
    there is no  s  ∈  S  such that  s ≤ t . 
    A set may have any number of minimal elements, including zero. 
   
   
    If  t  is  S 's only minimal element,
    then  t  is the  minimum  of  S . 
   
   
    The minimum element  t  (if it exists) is also called
    the  bottom  of  S 
    and is denoted by ⊥. 
   
  
Examples: 
 
  
     p ∧ q ∧ r 
    is a  maximal  element of the set in
     Figure 6 . 
    Since it is the only maximal element, it is the  maximum 
    or  top . 
   
   
    The set in Figure 6 has three  minimal  elements
    ( p ,  q , and  r ). 
    It has no  minimum  (because it has three minimal elements). 
   
   
    The set of all integers has no
     maximal  or  minimal  elements (Figure 1). 
    It has no  maximum  (because it has no maximal elements);
    similarly, it has no  minimum . 
   
  Bounds 

 Upper bounds and LUBs 


 
  Figure 5 (again)
 The  binary strings  no longer than 3,
 ordered by the prefix relation (with prefix low)
 
 


 
Let S be an ordered set and let E ⊆ S. 
 

  
     y  ∈  S  is an
     upper bound  of  E  iff
     x ≤ y  for every
     x  ∈  E . 
     E  may have no upper bound,
    one upper bound, or many. 
    Note that  y  need not be an element of
     E 
    in order to be an upper bound of  E . 
   
    We write  E u   to denote
    the set of all upper bounds of  E . 
     E u   may be
    empty, a singleton, or have many members. 
   
    If  E u  
    is non-empty and has a minimum element  u ,
    then  u  is called the
     least upper bound (LUB)  of  E ,
    written ∨ E . 
    The LUB of  E  is also called the
     supremum  or  join  of  E . 
     
    In the common case where  E  consists of exactly two elements
     s  and  t ,
    we can also write  s  ∨  t 
    (pronounced "the least upper bound of  s  and  t " or
    " s  join  t "). 
   
  
Examples, using the ordered set of Figure 5 as  S : 
 
  
    Consider  E ={01}. 
     E  has several upper bounds in  S ,
    01 itself, 010, and 011,
    so  E U  ={01,010,011}. 
     E U   has a minimum element
    under the prefix relation ≤, and that minimum is 01,
    so  E ={01} has a  LUB  of 01
    in  S . 
   
   
    Consider  E ={00,01}. 
    There is no element of  S 
    that is greater than both 00 and 01. 
     E  thus has no upper bound in  S ,
    and  E U   is empty. 
     E U   has no minimum element
    under the prefix relation ≤
    (because it has no elements at all),
    so  E  has no  LUB 
    in  S . 
   
  Lower bounds and GLBs 

 The  dual  concept for  upper bound 
is  lower bound , and analogous definitions apply. 
 

  
     z  ∈  S  is a  lower bound  of  E  iff
     z ≤ x  for every  x  ∈  E . 
    Note that  z  need not be an element of  E 
    in order to be a lower bound of  E . 
   
    We write  E l   to denote
    the set of all lower bounds of E. 
   
    If  E l  
    is non-empty and has a maximum element  v ,
    then  v  is called the  greatest lower bound (GLB)  of  E ,
    written ∧ E . 
    The GLB of  E  is also called the
     infimum  or  meet  of  E . 
     
    In the common case where  E  consists of exactly two elements
     s  and  t ,
    we can also write  s  ∧  t 
    (pronounced "the greatest lower bound of  s  and  t " or
    " s  meet  t "). 
   
  
Examples: 
 
   (Figure 5)  000  ∨  001
    is 00. 
   
    (Figure 3)  { scrambled eggs, Jane Eyre } has no GLB
    because it has no lower bound at all. 
   
  Existence of LUBs and GLBs 

  A LUB (GLB) can fail to exist for either of two reasons:
 
   There may be no upper (lower) bound at all;
     E u   ( E l   ) may be empty
    (for example, the binary strings in Figure 5 and {000, 001}). 
   
    There may be upper (lower) bounds,
    but no least upper bound (greatest lower bound). 
       There may be two or more minimal upper bounds (maximal lower bounds)
        that are not comparable, so that neither can be least (greatest)
        (for example, the divisibility ordering in Figure 7 and {2, 3}); or
       
        There may be an infinite descending (ascending) chain of
        upper (lower) bounds,
        so that none is minimal (maximal)
        (for example, as in the case of the reals with &lt;).

 The ordered set of  Figure 6 , lifted
 
 


 Lifting 

 
It is often useful for an ordered set to have a bottom,
but not all ordered sets have one (for example,
the set in Figure 6). 
In this case,
we can produce a new ordered set with a bottom
by adding a (new) least element to the original ordered set. 
This process is called  lifting ,
and the result of lifting an ordered set
 P  can be called " P  lifted",
written P ⊥ . 
 

 
Example: 
The non-empty conjunctions of any of
 p ,  q , and  r ,
ordered by implication (see  Figure 6 ),
has no bottom element. 
We can lift this set
by adding a new element, ⊥,
which is implied by all other elements. 
Here, ⊥ may be thought of as representing
the conjunction of 0 propositions. 
The lifted set is diagrammed in Figure 9. 
In terms of the knowledge expressed by each conjunction,
we may say that
a conjunction is an assertion
that we know each of its conjuncts is true;
thus, for example,
 p ∧ r  is an assertion that we know
 p  is true and we know  r  is true. 
Then ⊥ is an empty assertion,
one that does not assert that we know that any of
 p ,  q , or  r 
are true. 
 


 Diagrams 

 
We have been using diagrams of ordered sets without defining what they mean,
relying on the reader's intuition. 
It is time to confirm that intuition by defining what the diagrams mean. 
 
 
First we must consider the concept of covering. 
For  x , y   ∈ 
set  P  ordered by ≤,
we say  x   is covered by   y 
(written
 x   y )
if  x &lt; y 
and for any  z  ∈  P ,
 x ≤ z &lt; y 
implies  x = z . 
This means that there is no element of  P  "between"
 x  and  y . 
Equivalently,
we say
 y   covers   x . 
 

 
A  diagram  (or   Hasse diagram ) of an ordered set
is a graph in which
 
   each node corresponds to an element of the set,
   
    each edge corresponds to a covering relation between the nodes it connects,
    and
   
    if
    x y,
    then the node for x is drawn in a lower position than the node for y. 
   
  
Thus we see that
in interpreting diagrams,
it does not matter whether one node is above or below another
unless there is a monotonic path between them;
and that if there is a monotonic path from y through one or more nodes down to x,
there is no separate edge directly from y to x. 
 

 Examples in Figure 9:
 
    p ∧ q 
     covers   p 
    (because no other node is between them). 
    We may also write
     p 
    is covered by
     p ∧ q 
    or
     p   p ∧ q . 
   
    The figure indicates that
     p ∧ q ∧ r 
    implies  q . 
    Even though there is no line directly from
     p ∧ q ∧ r 
    to  q ,
    we know this because there is a monotonically-descending path from
     p ∧ q ∧ r 
    to  q . 
   
    There are non-monotonic paths from
     p ∧ q  to
     q ∧ r 
    (for example, down to  q  and back up),
    but this doesn't mean that  p ∧ q 
    implies  q ∧ r ,
    because none of the paths are monotonically descending. 
    In fact,
     p ∧ q  ||  q ∧ r . 
   
  Other examples:
 
   In Figure 7, 5 is below 9
    but this doesn't mean that 5 | 9
    because there is no monotonic path between them. 
    In fact, 5 || 9. 
   
  Isomorphisms on ordered sets 

 
The ordering of two sets may be the same
even if the two sets are different. 
Two ordered sets  P  and  Q  are  order-isomorphic ,
written P ≅Q,
if there is a mapping  φ  from  P  onto  Q 
such that
x ≤y in  P 
if and only if
 φ (x) ≤ φ (y) in  Q . 
Then  φ  is called an  order-isomorphism 
on the two sets. 
In discussing ordered sets,
we often simply say
 P  and  Q  are  isomorphic 
or
 φ  is an  isomorphism . 
 

 
It can be shown that two ordered sets are order-isomorphic
if and only if they can be drawn with identical diagrams.

 The ordered set of  Figure 6 , lifted
 
 


 
   Figure 2  (again)
  ℘ {a, b, c}, ordered by  ⊆ 
 
 


 
Example: 
The powerset of {a, b, c}
ordered by the subset relation (Figure 2),
and the conjunctions of any of a, b, and c
ordered by implication
and lifted by the addition of ⊥ (Figure 9),
are isomorphic. 
The isomorphism between them is given in the table below. 
 

    x ∈ P
       
        φ (x) ∈ Q
       
     {a, b, c}  a∧b∧c 
     {a, b}  a∧b 
     {a, c}  a∧c 
     {b, c}  b∧c 
     {a}  a 
     {b}  b 
     {c}  c 
      ∅  
       ⊥ 
      
From this isomorphism,
we can see that because
{a, b, c}  ⊇ {b, c},
we know that
 φ ({a, b, c}) implies  φ ({b, c})
or (written in terms of  Q )
a∧b∧c implies b∧c.

The   disjoint union  of two disjoint ordered sets  P  and  Q ,
written
 P   Q ,
is the union of  P  and  Q ,
with  P 's elements ordered as in  P 
and   Q 's elements ordered as in  Q ,
and each element of  P  incomparable with each element of  Q . 
The diagram of
 P   Q 
consists of  P 's diagram beside  Q 's diagram,
with no connection between them. 
 

 
The   linear sum  of two disjoint ordered sets  P  and  Q ,
written  P ⊕ Q ,
is the union of  P  and  Q ,
with  P 's elements ordered as in  P 
and   Q 's elements ordered as in  Q ,
and  x ≤ y  for each
 x  ∈  P  and  y  ∈  Q . 
The diagram of  P ⊕ Q 
consists of  Q 's diagram above  P 's diagram,
with an edge between
each minimal element of  Q  and
each maximal element of  P .

Examples, using the ordered sets
 P  from  Figure 3  and
 Q  from  Figure 6 :
 
  
     Figure 10  shows the disjoint union of
     P  and  Q ,
    written
     P   Q . 
    In the disjoint union,
    every elements from one set is incomparable to all elements in the other,
    but each set retains its own ordering. 
   
   
     Figure 11  shows the linear sum of
     P  and  Q ,
    written
     P ⊕ Q . 
    In the linear sum,
    each set retains its own ordering,
    but additionally each maximal element of the first set
    is covered by each minimal element of the second set. 
    The first set is an antichain,
    so all its elements are trivially maximal. 
    The second set has three minimal elements,
    and an edge is drawn down from each of
    the three minimal elements of  Q 
    to each of the five maximal elements of  P . 
   
   
     Figure 12  shows the linear sum of
     Q  and  P ,
    written
     Q ⊕ P . 
    In the linear sum,
    each set retains its own ordering,
    but additionally each maximal element of the first set
    is covered by each minimal element of the second set. 
    The first set has one maximal element (which is thus a maximum). 
    The second set is an antichain,
    so all its elements are trivially minimal,
    and an edge is drawn down from each of
    the five minimal elements of  P 
    to the single maximal element of  Q .

A subset  Q  of
ordered set  P  with order
 ⊑ 
is a  down-set  of  P 
if whenever
 x  ∈  Q ,
 y  ∈  P , and
 y  ⊑  x ,
then  y  ∈  Q . 
Informally,
 Q  contains one or more maximal elements
and every member of  P 
that is below any member of  Q . 
 

 
Dually,
a subset  Q  of
ordered set  P  with order
 ⊒ 
is an  up-set  of  P 
if whenever
 x  ∈  Q ,
 y  ∈  P , and
 y  ⊒  x ,
then  y  ∈  Q . 
 

 
Let  R  be an arbitrary subset of
ordered set  P  with order
 ⊑ . 
Then the smallest down-set containing  R ,
denoted ↓ R  and pronounced "down R",
is the set of all  x  ∈  P  for which
there is a  y  ∈  R  such that
 x  ⊑  y . 
 

 
Dually,
the smallest up-set containing  R ,
denoted ↑ R  and pronounced "up R",
is the set of all  x  ∈  P  for which
there is a  y  ∈  R  such that
 x  ⊒  y . 
 

 
If  R  is a singleton set { r },
then we may write ↓ r 
in place of
↓{ r } or ↓ R ;
or, dually,
↑ r  in place of ↑{ r } or ↑ R . 
Such down-sets (up-sets) are termed  principal down-sets (up-sets) 
of  P .
 

 
Examples, using the ordered set  P 
shown in  Figure 8 :
 
  
     Q ={3,6,9,12,15} is a down-set of  P 
    ( Figure 13 ). 
    To test this, pick any element
     x  of  Q 
    and any element  y  of  P ;
    then
    if  x | y ,
     y  ∈  Q . 
    For example, pick 6 from  Q . 
    Every element that 6 divides is in  Q 
    (in this case, the element 12). 
    The same will be true of any element you pick from  Q . 
   
   
     Q ={3,6,9,12,15} is in fact
    a  smallest down-set  and even
    a  principal down-set 
    of  P ;
    it is ↓3. 
    It appears that only in infinite ordered sets
    is it possible that a down-set is not also a smallest and principle down-set. 
   
   
     Q ={1,2,3,6} is an up-set of  P 
    ( Figure 14 ). 
    To test this, pick any element
     x  of  Q 
    and any element  y  of  P ;
    then
    if  y | x ,
     y  ∈  Q . 
    For example, pick 6 from  Q . 
    Every element that 6 divides is in  Q 
    (in this case, the elements 1, 2, and 3). 
    The same will be true of any element you pick from  Q . 
   
   
     Q ={1,2,3,6} is in fact
    a  smallest up-set  and even
    a  principal up-set 
    of  P ;
    it is ↑6.
