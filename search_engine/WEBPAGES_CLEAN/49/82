 4-year technological scaling<body>

  4-year technological scaling  
      CPU performance increases by 47% per year
 
     DRAM performance increases by 7%per year
 
     Assume the Alpha is scaled using this scaling and
 
  Organization remains  8KB/96KB/4MB/mem
  Benchmarks requirements are same
       Expect something similar if both L2/L3 cache size and benchmark size will increase
