 Computer Law Seminar Readings<body>
 
 Computer Law Seminar Readings    
 
  This list of  readings will grow as
the quarter progresses.  We'll mark new additions conspicuously.
 
  
 
 Many of these materials were written for lawyers,
which means they presume some familiarity with legal terms and concepts.
Of course I encourage you to note unfamiliar terms and bring them to class
so I can (try to) clarify them.   
 
 Most of these references are available on-line,
but some will be available only on paper.  Access instructions for paper
materials appear below.  
 
 Access to some of the electronic references
may be restricted to the UCI community (which is an example of intellectual
property law in practice).  The URLs to those references will work from
computers at UCI.  If you (as a UCI student) want access from off campus,
you'll need to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using free software
available from UCI's NACS (for Windows, Linux, or MacOS X).  NACS has
a page describing how to download and install the VPN software:  http://www.nacs.uci.edu/security/vpn.html 
.  
 
 The readings come from a variety of sources,
such as:  
  
 Law review article—a law review is a publication
containing scholarly articles about the law, typically written by law professors
(for the main articles) or law students (for the shorter articles, often
designated "Note" or "Comment").  Law reviews are roughly
akin to academic journals in CS, except that they're edited at law schools
by law students.  A citation with "L.R" or "L.J." in
the title, especially along with a law school name, is probably a law review.
 Law review articles are among the most intensively documented publications
in the world; every assertion is backed up with a citation in a footnote.
 A tongue-in-cheek metric of the scholarly quality of a law review article
is the extent to which the volume of the footnotes exceeds the volume of
the main document.    
 
 Popular media article—Newspaper and magazine
articles tend to be accessible, since they're written for non-lawyers,
but they're subject to the problems we discussed in class (incompleteness,
oversimplification, technical inaccuracy, focus on sensational facts over
legal issues, lack of long-term follow-up).    
 
 Article in a professional publication—Articles
for computing professionals (e.g., in the  Communications of the ACM )
or for legal professionals (e.g., in the  ABA Journal  from the American
Bar Association) often hit a good balance between accessibility and accuracy.

            Lexis access:  The Lexis system was one of
                the first full-text-searchable databases, first available about 30 years
    ago.  Access is available to the UCI community at  http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe  .  You can search here for cases and statutes.  
        The meaning of legal terms goes beyond the plain English meaning of the words. Even a law dictionary won't give you all the nuances and applications of a legal term, but law dictionaries are a place to start. Two on-line law dictionaries are at  dictionary.law.com  and  dictionary.findlaw.com .  
        
  Computer Law—General  [for reference;
not an assignment]   
  
 There are good, short, reasonably current
overviews of many legal topics at  http://lp.findlaw.com 
, which also provides access to statutes and reported cases (i.e., appellate
court opinions).    
 
 NGOs (non-governmental organizations) often
follow legislation and pending cases in their areas of interest.

      site:   http://www.acm.org/usacm/

      ( http://www.riaa.com/ ) and the Motion
      Picture Association of America ( http://www.mpaa.org/ )
      take an industry perspective.   
   
     The Electronic Privacy Information Center
      ( http://www.epic.org ) covers privacy issues,
      as does the American Civil Liberties Union ( http://www.aclu.org/ ).

 From that page, click the "Images" link to see what the real
patent application looks like.  Don't feel obligated to read through
the entire patent application, but look it over (especially the front page
and the claims).  
   [Patent] Michael Risch,  Patent Troll Myths , 42 Seton Hall Law Review ____ (2012) (also available at  SSRN ).  A radio interview with the author is available at  hearsayculture.com .      [Patent]  Bilski v. Kappos  is the Supreme Court's 2010 decision addressing the statutory subject matter of patents, particularly what kinds of "business methods" can be patented.    
   [Patent and Copyright] Oracle vs. Google:  Oracle wants to collect royalties from Google for Google's use of Java in the Android platform.  The  complete set of case 
documents  is available.  Most of them are just clerical details, but you should find substantive details if you look at the ones with  titles including "Complaint" or "Answer" or "Motion" or "Memorandum" (and avoid the ones with "Notice" or "Pro Hac Vice"). One document that lays out the particular issues in dispute from Google's perspective is the  first expert report of Owen Astrachan , who teaches computer science at Duke. Note that some of the listed documents aren't available because they're "filed under seal," i.e., confidential, presumably because they include trade secret information.  [Alternate source]

      This is only available on paper; the packet looks large, but the print
      is not dense.  You can find this packet on the table in the Technology Garden, room 5054 Donald Bren Hall.  There's a nice
      couch there where you can read it; if you must take it away to read elsewhere,
      leave a note so a classmate won't look in vain and bring it back promptly.  (The packet is  bound with a large black metal clip.)       [Computer Crime] Chris Jay Hoofnagle,  Identity Theft: Making the Known Unknowns Known , 21 Harvard J. Law Tech. 97 (2007). [ Alternative link ]
