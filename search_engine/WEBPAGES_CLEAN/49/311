Larry,

On Friday, the DMA Technical Committee moved its next meeting away from the 
week of July 8 in order to accelerate some of its work.  (The meeting will 
be in Costa Mesa the week of June 24).

Thanks for trying to set up a way for people to attend both meetings 
without conflicts.

Dennis

[. . .]

I was hoping also that some things would get discussed at a July 8 f2f
meeting at NaviSoft, but I hadn't heard back about whether the July 10
meeting could get moved. (The DMA technical committee meets in the SF
bay area July 9-12.)

If Navisoft can't host on July 8, I could probably arrange to host the
meeting at Xerox PARC.
