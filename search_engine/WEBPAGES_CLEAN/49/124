             Welcome! 
          


   
     This  Institute for Software Research  site is a resource of information concerning software architecture.  Here, you will find information designed to help software engineers and researchers learn  how to use software architecture-based technologies effectively . 
     UCI's  software architecture research  is directed at increasing the overall quality of software while reducing both the cost of development and time to market by focusing attention on high-level, principal design issues. We believe that architecture is  not just a phase  in the development life cycle, but   a discipline pervading all phases of development  . 
     Our research in software architecture differs from other approaches because it focuses on four  key principles of software architecture : 
         extensibility</strong>   - to address different concerns, different stakeholder needs, and different desired qualities,       
          environments</strong>   - to support architecture as  a discipline  throughout the lifecycle,  
          architecture styles</strong>   - to capture and reuse intellectual insights that ensure various qualities, and  
          real systems</strong>   - in addition to using our tools in industry,  we use our tools to make our tools .  
      For more information on software architecture and how to use it effectively, please also read our  software architecture overview . 
   

   What's New! 
   
      [July 2008]  Work begins on a  new version of ArchStudio .
       [February 2008]  A protoytpe tool which tracks architectural changes during design as been added to ArchStudio 4. This tool is called  EASEL  and is an effort to add psudeo change-set-like abilities to the ArchStudio 4 evnrinoment.
       [March 2007]  Astatechart tool has been added to ArchStudio 4's Archipelago editor.
       [November 2006]  A completely new ArchStudio —  ArchStudio 4  — has been released. Building on the successes and insights of ArchStudio 3, ArchStudio 4 performs faster, has a better and more intuitive user interface, and is fully integrated into the Eclipse development environment.    
       [November 2006]  A architectural style and Java-based framework for supporting architecture-based applications has been developed called  Myx . A new version of Archstudio will utilize this new framework to increase the speed and efficiency of event/message passing within a single machine environment.
       [June 2006]  The ISR  Software Architecture  Research website has been given a face lift and updated with the latest information.
       [January 2006]    Demonstrations of decentralized trust management using the the  PACE framework  are now available!
       [March 2005]   ArchStudio 3  has been enhanced with an analysis framework,  TRON , and a visual editor, Archipelago!
    

   About ISR Software Architecture  
   
     The  Institute for Software Research 's efforts in  software architecture research  are grounded in the issues involving  architecture-based design , from architecture  modeling  to  implementation , addressing issues of  architectural styles ,   security &amp; trust , modeling  product lines , and  internet scale architectures . We also have a number of  software projects   available to download. 
     Please also visit the  Institute for Software Research  to learn more about our other research areas.
