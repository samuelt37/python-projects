 Tree Approximation for Belief Updating 

 Robert Mateescu, Rina Dechter and Kalev Kask 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a parameterized approximation scheme
for probabilistic inference. The scheme, called Mini-Clustering (MC), extends
the partition-based approximation offered by mini-bucket elimination, to tree
decompositions. The benefit of this extension is that all single-variable
beliefs are computed (approximately) at once, using a two-phase
message-passing process along the cluster tree. The resulting approximation
scheme allows adjustable levels of accuracy and efficiency, in anytime
style. Empirical evaluation against competing algorithms such as iterative
belief propagation and Gibbs sampling demonstrates the potential of the MC
approximation scheme for several classes of problems.
