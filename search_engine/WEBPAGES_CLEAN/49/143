 Designing and Developing User Interfaces<body>
     Designing 
and Evaluating User Interfaces          1. 
Set up a design  team         
 (Programmers, HCI designers, graphical designers / artists, 
technical authors,        user representatives,  management representatives)       2. 
Gather requirements, analyze tasks and users          3. 
Start UI design  early  (before code is written)        • helps elicit 
requirements from customers         • serves as a requirements specification for customers and programmers   
    4. Use software tools for UI design and 
prototyping      
     5. Follow guidelines (e.g., 
ISO 9241, OS-specific guidelines     
     , 
house styles)       6. Make evaluation    
a central component of system design        
      
        
• Start early (before code has been written)          • Use evaluation in 
all phases (formative and summative)          
• Involve real users          
• Use "cheap" techniques first (e.g., walkthroughs)       7. 
Develop guidelines
