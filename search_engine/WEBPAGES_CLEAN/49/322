     Brief description:  
Ozone is a scalable, heterogeneous monicker system for
	Unix.  
	It is a scheme and mechanism
	for representing references to  any  exported object
	in a distributed environment.
	The term ``Monicker'' comes from Microsoft's OLE2 specification
	and Ozone monickers are compatible with the OLE2 Monicker
	API.
 
	Ozone provides:
	    Location transparency.
	       Scalability vis-a-vis large numbers of objects.
	       Multi-language heterogeneity.
	       (Limited) support for dynamic reconfiguration.
