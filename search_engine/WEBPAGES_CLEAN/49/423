  Grading Policies  
 All Bren School and Major requirements must be taken for a letter grade unless the
required course is designated as “P/NP Only”. 
   
    
    »</strong>  Calculating your GPA</strong> 
 The Official UC GPA is calculated by dividing the total number of Grade Points by the total number of Attempted UC Units. 
     Letter Grade</strong> 
  Grade Points</strong> 
   A 
 4 points per unit 
   B 
 3 points per unit 
   C 
 2 points per unit 
   D 
 1 points per unit 
   F and I (incomplete) 
 0 points per unit 
   
  A+ grade is assigned 4 points per unit.  
  Plus or minus suffixes modify 
  the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per  unit. E.g., B+ is 3.3 points
  per unit, D- is 0.7 points per unit.  
  Non-letter grades (P, NP, I, etc.) are excluded in calculating GPA.

(12) 
   
    »</strong>  Pass/No Pass </strong> 
 The P/NP grading option may be used for courses that count toward the unit requirement for the B.A. degree, and toward
the General Education Requirement. 
 No more than two P/NP courses may be applied to any minor on campus. 
  An average of 4 units may be taken P/NP per quarter  
 No more than 12 units TOTAL may be applied towards graduation requirements during your undergraduate career. 
 “Pass” is equal to grade of C or better. 
  “Not Pass” is equal to a grade of C- or below. 
    Detailed information can be found in the  General Catalogue . 
   
    »</strong>  Illegal Duplication of Credit </strong> 
 Undergraduate
and graduate students may not receive unit credit or earn grade points for
college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously
completed course or examination for which the student has been granted college
credit. 
   
    »</strong>  Repeating
Deficient Grades </strong> 
 A course may
be repeated only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received. Unit credit for courses so repeated will be given only once. 
 The grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded.  
 Only the most recently received grades
and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated when calculating
GPA. (The grade point average is based on all additional grades assigned in
cases of further course repetitions.)
