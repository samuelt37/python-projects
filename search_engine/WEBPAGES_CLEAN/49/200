VHDL Reference Guide - Entity 
    Entity   
       Primary Library Unit 
          Syntax       
  

 
     entity  entity_name is
   generic (generic_list);	
   port (port_list);
end entity_name;
  
   
  

 
See LRM section 1.1

        Rules and Examples       
  

 
   The port list must define the name, the mode (i.e. direction) and
the type of each port on the  entity :
  entity  HALFADD is
  port(A,B : in bit;
       SUM, CARRY : out bit);
end HALFADD;

 entity  COUNTER is
port (CLK  : in std_ulogic;
      RESET: in std_ulogic;
      Q    : out integer
                 range 0 to 15);
end COUNTER;
  
   
  

 
   The top-level  entity  in a simulateable  VHDL  model is usually
"empty", i.e. has no ports. Its architecture is usually the "test bench":
  entity  TB_DISPLAY is
end TB_DISPLAY;

architecture TEST of TB_DISPLAY is
-- signal declarations
-- component declaration(s)
begin
-- component instance(s)
-- test processes
end TEST;
  
   
  

 
   Each  entity  port acts like a signal which is visible in the
architecture(s) of the  entity . The mode (i.e.direction) of each port
determines whether it may be read from or written to in the
architecture:
   Mode  Read in Arch?  Write in Arch    in  Yes  No    out  No  Yes    inout  Yes  Yes    buffer  Yes  Yes    
   
  

 
   If an  entity  has generics, these must be declared before the ports.
They do not have a mode, as by definition they can only pass information
into the  entity :
  entity  AN2_GENERIC is
   generic (DELAY: time := 1.0 ns);
   port (A,B : in std_ulogic;
         Z : out std_ulogic);
end AN2_GENERIC;
  
   
  

 
   An  entity  may also contain declarations. Items declared are visible
within the arhitecture(s) of the  entity . 
   
  

 
        Synthesis Issues       
  

 Entity  declarations are supported for suynthesis, providing the port
types are acceptable to the logic synthesis tool. Usually, only generics
of type integer are supported. Values for generics have to be supplied
by the user at the time of synthesis.

 
        Whats New in '93       

In  VHDL -93, the keyword  end  may be followed by the keyword
  entity   for clarity and consistancy.
