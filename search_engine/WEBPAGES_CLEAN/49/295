    Trappe-Washington, Exercise 10 of Chapter 7.
   Trappe-Washington, Exercise 11 of Chapter 7.
   
Alice wants to send Bob a message  M 
that is the price she is willing to pay for his used car 
( M  is just an integer in binary).
She uses the ElGamal algorithm to encrypt  M  into the ciphertext
 C 
using Bob's public key, so only he can decrypt it. But Eve
has intercepted  C  and she doesn't even know Bob's public key. 
Explain how
Eve can alter the ciphertext  C  to change it into  C'  so that
if she sends  C'  to Bob (with Eve pretending to
be Alice), then, after Bob has decrypted  C' , he will get a
plaintext message that is twice the value of  M .
   
Suppose Eve has captured two ciphertexts  C=(a,b)  and
 D=(c,d)  for
two separate message  M  and  N , respectively, that were 
sent to Bob under the ElGamal encryption scheme (using the same public key
for Bob). Explain how Eve can construct a valid encyption of the
product  MN .
