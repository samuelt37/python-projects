						 The idea behind STRING is simple: it’s an interface for emotional connection across physical distance. Designed for couples, the device is a loop of string about a meter long, allowing the user to bend it, knot it, twist it, loop it, or wear it. Upon contact with skin, a circuit is completed and sensors capture motion, translating it as an abstract visualization to the other person via a screen-based interface. STRING allows the different physical spaces two people are in to intersect in a discreet, interpretive, and beautiful way.

   STRING’s design challenge: The Virtual and the Real  
 The advent of 3D printing technologies and object/motion capture brings new potential for crossing the divide between manifesting thoughts in the digital realm and the physical world. However, these technologies seem to simply bring design across the threshold from the virtual to the real, or from the real to the virtual. How might 3D printing and motion capture be made more complementary to each other? How might virtual representations and the digital capture of physical objects or relationships be made to translate or transduce useful aspects of materiality and embodiment? What new opportunities are there for immersion, reflection, augmentation, and experience in these technologies? What new kinds of aesthetics and evocations are possible when we think across these boundaries? What are the consequences of using the virtual to model the physical, and the physical to model the virtual? Your challenge is to work with modeling software, 3D printing, and motion/image capture devices to challenge the dichotomy of the virtual and the physical, to express its consequences, or to create a new space for experience, reflection, and action in the world.
