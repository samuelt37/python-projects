virtual bool OrderAtoms(const std::vector&lt;OEAtomBase*&gt; &amp;order)
    
Reorder the atoms of a molecule.  This method modifies the order in
which the atoms are visited by the iterator returned by
OEMolBase::GetAtoms.  This method does not affect the atom indices
of any of the atoms of the molecule.  This method does not affect
the ordering of any other iterator, including bonds over a molecule,
bonds over an atom or neighboring atoms over an atom.
