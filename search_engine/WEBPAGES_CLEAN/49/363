 <body>        Babak Shahbaba         HOME    RESEARCH    PUBLICATION    TEACHING    ACTIVITIES    CODES         BABAK SHAHBABA  ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR  DIRECTOR, THE CENTER FOR STATISTICAL CONSULTING  UCI                TEACHING     At UCI, I have been teaching several undergraduate and graduate courses, including Introduction to Statistics, Introduction to Biostatistics, Advanced Statistical Methods, Generalized Linear Models, Bayesian Analysis, and Statistical Consulting. I have also taught a new elective course on Modern Data Analysis. Playing into my research theme regarding the development of statistical methods for big data problems, this course focuses on machine learning techniques for high-dimensional problems from the statistical point of view. This year, I will be teaching courses on mathematical statistics and computational statistics. Here are some of the courses I have taught over the past several years.      STATS 225: Bayesian Analysis  Bayesian inference, Decision theory, Computational methods in Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo simulation, Markov Chain process, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, Bayesian regression and classification models, Bayesian analysis of real data, Gaussian process for regression and classification, Dirichlet process mixture models.   Course notes      STATS 235: Modern Data Analysis (Machine Learning)  The objective of this course is to introduces statistical methods in machine learning. We will discuss modern statistical methods commonly applied to high dimensional problems, for which traditional methods might fail. By the end of this course, students would learn a range of statistical methods and machine learning techniques, and they would learn how to use these methods to solve complex, high dimensional problems. Throughout this course, students would be exposed to both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms.      STATS 230: Statistical Computing Methods  The objective of this course is to learn computational methods in statistics. By the end of this course, students are expected to be able to write their own computer programs (as opposed to relying on existing packages) to perform statistical analysis. The two main components of this course are optimization methods and sampling algorithms. Primarily, we discuss optimization methods within the frequentist framework and sampling algorithms with respect to their application in Bayesian inference. Additionally, we discuss a variety of other computational methods (e.g., numerical linear algebra, bootstrap) that are commonly used in modern statistics. Students participating in this class are expected to have some background in statistics and probability (at least two quarters of upper division or graduate coursework). Also, they need to be comfortable with at least one programming language.     STATS 211: Statistical Methods II  A brief review of linear models; Model assessment and selection; Controlling complexity (PCR, PLS, Lasso); Basis expansions; Splines; GAM; Gaussian process regression models; Multilevel models (mixed effect models); Linear discriminant analysis; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Naive Bayes classifiers.   Course notes    Examples and R codes      STATS 212: Generalized Linear Models  Linear regression models-- a quick review; A preview of generalized linear models; Exponential family; Binomial, multinomial, and Poisson distributions; Logistic regression for binary outcome; Multinomial logistic models for nominal and ordinal outcome; Poisson regression for counts; Loglinear models; Quasi-likelihood; Bayesian GLM; Random effects models.   Course notes      STATS 275: Statistical Consulting  The objective of this course is to learn how to form a scientific question, translate it to a statistical problem, apply an appropriate statistical method for inference, and report findings in a language understandable by non-statistician scientists. Throughout this course, students will collaborate with other scientists at UCI and work on a specific project.      STATS 8: Introduction To Biostatistics  Designing scientific studies; Exploring data; Probability; Continuous and discrete probability distributions; Estimation; Hypothesis testing; Linear regression models.
