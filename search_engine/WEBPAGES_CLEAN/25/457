  Authoring Support for Language Variants (cont�d)  
      Con: 
 
  spec. does not provide authoring support for language variants, a standard HTTP capability
  reduces i18n support in spec.
       
 
     But note:
 
  language variants can still be edited -- it�s just up to the user to discover the location of the variants
