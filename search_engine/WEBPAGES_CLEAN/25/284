 Abstract  
This paper describes a class of probabilistic
approximation algorithms based on bucket
elimination which offer adjustable levels of
accuracy and effciency. We analyze the approximation 
for several tasks: finding the
most probable explanation, belief 
updating and finding the maximum a posteriori
hypothesis. We identify regions of 
completeness and provide preliminary 
empirical evaluation on randomly generated networks.
