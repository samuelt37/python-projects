  abstract = {Most Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) that have been implemented
    to date have many restrictions imposed on the user for the convenience
    of the system programmer. Among these restrictions two common ones are
    (1) requiring the user to declare the structure of all the records beforehand,
    and (2) requiring the user to maintain a detailed knowledge of these
    structures at query time. A design for an IRS is proposed in which both
    of these problems are alleviated. A Relational Data Base System in the
    style of Codd's work is described that allows the data itself to define
    the structure of each stored record differently from every other record.
    At query time, the user is not required to have any knowledge of these
    structures, but merely be aware of the relationships that exist between
    the various data items. These relationships may be represented as a digraph,
    where the nodes model the data items, and the edges model the relationships.
    With this model, a query is equivalent to finding a given subgraph of
    a graph.}}

    the tree-width of a graph to the maximum size of a $K_h$-minor in it.}}

    the order defined by the matching quality. Each subgraph that is recognized
    is introduced as a node in a direct net that compiles different alternatives
    of interpretation of the features in the feature graph. A path in the
    net represents a consistent succession of characters in the word. The
    method allows the recognition of characters that overlap, or that are
    underlined. A final search for the optimal path under certain criteria
    gives the best interpretation of the word features. The character recognizer
    uses a flexible matching between the features and a flexible grouping
    of the individual features to be matched. Broken characters are recognized
    by looking for gaps between features that may be interpreted as part
    of a character. Touching characters are recognized because the matching
    allows non-matched adjacent features. The recognition results of this

    patterns in Hough space. The efficiency of this technique is based to
    a great deal on the extraction of structural and geometrical object features
    available under orthographic but not under perspective projection. For
    this reason the paper presents a method to make the recognition approach
    applicable for perspective views too. After discussing some basic properties
    of perspective Hough spaces the authors propose a method for detecting
    vanishing points in Hough space. They are used to reconstruct an orthographic
    view of the perspectively observed image by orthogonalizing cluster patterns
    in Hough space. Recognition is realized by matching graphs extracted
    from these orthogonalized patterns to model graphs by means of an attributed
    subgraph isomorphism detection algorithm. It is supported substantially
    by 3D information extracted from the perspective image by vanishing point
    detection. A second recognition step is introduced to identify topologically
    correct but geometrically inconsistent isomorphisms. Simulation results

    which uses the new partitioning methods for vertices, especially tailored
    for the logic diagram. In the error detection procedure, a graph is divided
    into subgraphs, based on a new concept, 'route-subgraph', and tests for
    graph isomorphism between subgraphs are performed. These algorithms enable
    precise and rapid search for any error points in the VLSI design. These
    new algorithms have been implemented and examined for practical feasibility.
