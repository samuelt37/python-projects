 Faculty profile 

 
 

  Judith  Gregory</strong>  Associate Adjunct Professor</strong>  DEGREE: Ph.D. 2000, UC-San Diego  RESEARCH AREAS:    RESEARCH INTERESTS:  Throughout my research career, I have been motivated by questions
regarding how design and design practices shape our socio-technical
worlds. Design is about far more than producing sleek products for
consumers and markets: design integrally entails situating interactive
artifacts and media -- and enhanced built environments for learning,
enjoyment and participation in society -- in the complex realities of our
emergent information infrastructure as it affects our everyday lived
experience and social worlds.
