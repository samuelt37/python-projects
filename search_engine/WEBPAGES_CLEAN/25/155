                   This page tells you more how you can use variables in wiki pages. This is especially helpful within  templates , but also on "normal" wiki pages (like for signing a contribution).          Contents

  Predefined Variables 
   The following variables are substituted when a page is saved.   Note that they will appear unreplaced in the preview!</strong>              Variable           
     Description

       @  PAGE@       
     Name of the page (useful for template pages)   
      HelpOnPageCreation    
       @  DATE@       
     Current date in the system's format            
     2004-08-30   
       @  TIME@       
     Current date and time in the user's format     
     2004-08-30 06:38:05   
       @  ME@         
     Just the user's name                           
      TheAnarcat    
       @  USERNAME@   
     Just the user's name (or his domain/IP)        
      TheAnarcat    
       @  USER@       
     Signature "-- loginname"                       
     --  TheAnarcat    
       @  SIG@        
     Dated Signature "-- loginname date time"       
     --  TheAnarcat  2004-08-30 06:38:05   
       @  MAILTO@     
     A fancy mailto: link with the user's data      
     None - on public sites, better use the Mail  To macro)   
           
  Expanding Variables 
     You can use Home  Page  Name/My  Dict to expand those variables, just put a dictionary (see  HelpOnDictionaries ) there with your variables and values. For example,              VAR1:: substitution 1
   VAR2:: substitution 2        
  Getting Variables 
     
  At Every Page Refresh 
     You can use these values using the  GetVal  macro:               &lt;&lt;GetVal(WikiDict,var1)&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;GetVal(WikiDict,var2)&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;GetVal(WikiDict,var3)&gt;&gt;      Renders as:                
  When Saving the Page 
     If the variables are set on !UserName/! MyDict  (UserName must of course be replaced as appropriate), you can get the variables when saving any page with @var1@, @var2@, ...etc. instead of the  GetVal  macro.                    Note that data in dict pages is cached and does not require opening and parsing the page file for each access to the value. In CGI, the value is fetched from a pickle, in long running process, the pickle is loaded once and then the value is accessed from memory.         Note that saving template pages and using preview does  not  expand variables. Other than that, variable expansion is very global and happens anywhere on the page, including code displays, comments, processing instructions and other "special" areas of a page you might think are excluded.
