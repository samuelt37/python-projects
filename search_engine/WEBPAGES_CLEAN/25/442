Parallel and On-Line Graph Coloring 
Brad Hutchings, ICS, UC Irvine 

 Brad described results from a paper by Magnus M. Halldorsson in
 Journal of Algorithms  23, 265-280 (1987). The approximate
coloring algorithms in the paper work by forming a maximal partial
coloring with a limited number of colors. The remaining uncolored
vertices are partitioned according to their adjacencies with
members of one color class, forming a collection of subgraphs with
smaller chromatic number. These subgraphs are then colored
independently and recursively. Halldorsson shows that this approach
leads to approximation ratios of
O( n  / log  n ), not only sequentially
but also in the parallel and on-line settings.
