   Data Set Information:  
 Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE&gt;16) &amp;&amp; (AGI&gt;100) &amp;&amp; (AFNLWGT&gt;1)&amp;&amp; (HRSWK&gt;0))  Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
