Given a graph with edge weights that are linear functions of a parameter,
finds the sequence of
 minimum spanning trees  produced as the parameter varies,
in total time O(mn log n), by combining ideas
from " Sparsification "
and " Geometric lower bounds ".
Also solves various problems of optimizing the parameter value,
including one closely related to that in
" Choosing subsets with maximum weighted average ".
