 Mentor tips 

 
 

The partnership between a mentor and a protégé is
            built upon trust, respect and professionalism. Here are some
 tips
            to help you establish a successful and rewarding mentoring 
relationship. If you would like to share your insights on mentoring or 
provide
                feedback about the program, please  e-mail us .    TIPS ON MENTORING </strong> 
                Successful mentoring involves initiative on the part of 
both the
                mentor and the student. Some of the things to keep in 
mind when building
                a mentor/student relationship are:     
                »</strong>  Maintain regular contact   »</strong>  Be 
approachable and accessible by e-mail and/or telephone    »</strong>  
Participate in activities related to common interests   »</strong>  Find 
ways to exchange information if you are not local   »</strong>  Be clear
 about your expectations and boundaries   SAMPLE ACTIVITES </strong>  

                Activites between mentors and mentees can be as simple 
as meeting
                for coffee or exchanging e-mail. However, the more 
involved you are
                with your mentor or mentee has a direct correlation to 
the success
                of your relationship. Here are some possible activities:
     
                »</strong>  Attend an on-campus event together    »</strong>  Offer to
 do an informational interview for your student   »</strong>  Review 
your student's resume   »</strong>  Schedule
 a visit to the mentor's workplace   »</strong>  Ask your
 student to view his research or attend a student group event
