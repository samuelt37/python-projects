   Triangulating polygons without large angles .  M. Bern ,
 D. Dobkin ,
and D. Eppstein.  
 8th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Berlin, 1992, pp. 222–231 .   Int. J. Comp. Geom. &amp; Appl.  5: 171–192, 1995 
(special issue for 8th Symp. Comput. Geom.)
 
Follows up " Polynomial size non-obtuse
triangulation of polygons ";
improves the number of triangles by relaxing the requirements on their angles.
Again mostly subsumed by results of Bern et al described in
" Faster circle packing ".
