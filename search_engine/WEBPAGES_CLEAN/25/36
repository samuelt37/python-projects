  Using MoinMoin with Twisted 
      Twisted  is an event-driven networking framework for many kinds of applications.   For  MoinMoin  Twisted is used as a web server that just imports  MoinMoin  persistently. This has the advantage that the Python interpreter and all Python scripts (including Twisted itself and also  MoinMoin ) is only loaded and initialized one time, and that data can be cached in memory from request to request, enhancing the performance of  MoinMoin .             First do  ../BasicInstallation  and  ../WikiInstanceCreation .         Besides the general installation you need 3 files:          the script  /path/to/cgi-dir/mointwisted  (see "Starting the server" below)       the webserver script file like  mointwisted.py  (which needs to be in the same directory where your working directory is).       the configuration file like   /path/to/wikiconfig-dir/wikiconfig.py             Contents

  Install Twisted 
     First, install Twisted (see URL above). Many Linux distributions have Twisted packages. Please refer to the documentation of Twisted for installation information.       
  Configuring the Twisted server 
     Copy the file  wiki/server/mointwisted.py  to your wiki directory. Edit and adapt the settings to your needs.       
  System path configuration 
     If you did a standard install, and you are not a developer, you probably want to skip this section. Otherwise, you might want to add the path to moin and config file, like that:                 sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/moin')
  sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/wikiconfig')      
  Config class options 
     If you did a standard install, the default options might be just what you need. Check and change what you like:              Option</strong>   
      Default</strong>   
      Comment</strong>   
       docs   
     '/usr/share/moin/wiki/htdocs'   
     Path to moin shared files   
       user   
     'www-data'   
     If you run as root, the server will run as this user   
       group   
     'www-data'   
     If you run as root, the server will run as this group   
       port   
     8080   
     Port to serve. To serve a privileged port below 1024 you will have to run as root   
       interfaces   
      ['']    
     A list of interfaces the server will listen to. If the list contains the entry  ''  (like for the default configuration), all other entries are ignored and the server will listen to all interfaces.   
       logPath   
     'mointwisted.log'   
     Log file.   
       profiler   
     commented python code   
     Useful only if you are a moin developer.   
         
  Configuring wikiconfig.py 
     The sample config file should be just fine.       Don't change  url_prefix_static  as the default value is hardcoded in the Twisted server.       
  Starting the server 
     
  on Unix 
     On GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or another POSIX-like OS, copy  wiki/server/mointwisted  to your wiki directory. You might want to adapt  PYTHONPATH  and the path to  twistd .        Start the server with  ./mointwisted start  and test your wiki at  http://localhost:8080/ . Stop the server with  ./mointwisted stop .       For more options run  ./mointwisted  without arguments.       If you want to start the server via initscript make sure  mointwisted  finds  montwisted.py  on startup!          
  on Windows 
     Copy  wiki/server/mointwisted.cmd  to your wiki directory. You might have to change the path pointing to the python-scripts directory.       Double click  mointwisted.cmd  to start the server. It will create a new terminal window. To stop the server, close the terminal window.
