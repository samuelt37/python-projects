15.2.3 OETriposTypeNames 
 

 
This function is very similar to  OETriposAtomTypeNames , and sets the
atom type name string property using  OEAtomBase::SetType .  However,
instead of doing graph matching to perceive the Tripos atom types, it
assumes  OETriposAtomTypes  has already been called.  This is a simple
optimization, that avoids duplicating effort and just sets the atom
type name string property from the value stored in

  
The atom type name string property should typically be set to a Tripos
type name before writing a Sybyl .mol2 file using the low-level
 OEWriteMol2File  function.
