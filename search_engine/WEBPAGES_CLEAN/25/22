&gt;&gt; This is the idea brought up by Marty in the message
&gt;&gt; &lt; 9605291632.AA0573@ccmnotes1.cwi.com &gt; and by Jim in his proposal
&gt;&gt; on versioning, where he proposes the new content type
&gt;&gt; text/config.
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for this note but can't find it. Can you point me to
&gt;the suggestion for "text/config"?

The referenced proposal is accessible off of the working group's web page:

 http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/ 

Or it can be directly accessed at URL:

 ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/ejw/www_vers.ps 

This is a *rough* draft of a proposal I'm working on with Marty Cagan of
Continuus.  I welcome any comments any members of this mailing list may
have on this proposal.

&gt;(Is this mailing list archived/hypermailed?)

The mailing list does not currently have a hypermail archive, however I
will be setting this up in the near future.

- Jim
