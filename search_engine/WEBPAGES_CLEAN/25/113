    				First meeting using E2E    			 
  			 
    			 After a few demos and one mistrial, finally we had our real meting using E2Esstem.  It demonstrated the basic functionality — camera switching, aymmetrical environments and multiple sensors.  We do have a long way to go — this is just the beginning — but I am so pleased that we started using E2E for real use.  I am so happy that we will be using this as we go forward and develop this further.
