   Multivariate regression depth .  M. Bern

We generalize  regression depth 
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in R d  there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
" Computing the Depth of a Flat ".
