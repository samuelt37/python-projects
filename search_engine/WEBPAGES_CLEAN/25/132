 Victim Cache<body>

  Victim Cache  
      Mainly used to eliminate conflict miss
 
     Prediction: the memory address of a cache line that is replaced  is likely to be accessed again in near future
 
     Scenario for prediction to be effective: false sharing, ugly address mapping
 
     Architecture implementation: use a on-chip buffer to store the contents of recently replaced cache line
 
     Drawbacks
 
  Ugly mapping can be rectified by cache aware compiler
  Small size of victim cache, probability of memory address reuse within short period is very low.
  Experiment shows victim cache is not effective across the board for DI apps.
