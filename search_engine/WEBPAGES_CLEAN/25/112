  Economic Sanctions  
             
In 1980,  the US refused to sell grain to the Soviet Union if the Soviet 
  
Union did not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.  The Soviet Union 
  
paid a higher price to buy grain from Argentina and did not withdraw 
  
from Afghanistan.
    
In 1983, Australia refused to sell uranium to France, unless France ceased 
  
nuclear testing in the South Pacific.  France paid a higher price to buy 
  
uranium from South Africa and continued nuclear testing.
               
In 1983, South Africa threatened to block the imports of goods into Lesotho 
  
(a small country completely surrounded by South Africa) if Lesotho did not 
  
expel 22 members of the African National Congress. Within two weeks, 
  
Lesotho expelled the ANC members.
