3.9.3 GetType 
 
   
virtual unsigned int GetType()
    
This pure virtual method is designed to return a unique identifier for
each OEExprBase implementation.  A listing of type identifiers
returned by classes in OEChem which are derived from the OEExprBase
class can be found in the OEExprType namespace.  User-defined
implementations of the OEExprBase class should return value for this
method which does not collide with types returned by implementations
provided by OEChem.
