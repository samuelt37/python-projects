    Direct-manipulative 
interaction style      Â                   Characteristics    
      Graphical interface objects
        
that represent task objects/functions, or objects in the user's work environment.   
    
  Selection and manipulation of interface 
objects through pointing device.       One 
or more  metaphors  presented, of which most interface 
objects form part.       Operations 
on task objects is performed through "congruent" operations on the interface objects.   
  
  All options are normally available
at all times.   
     Important 
design requirements          Consistent 
metaphor(s)       Immediate 
feedback       Icons 
should be clearly distinguishible through  overall shape and color.    
     The
           form of the interfaces objects (and the form of the mouse icon when
          hoovering 
above interfaces objects) indicate the operations that can be performed ("perceived
affordance", "look

and feel")
