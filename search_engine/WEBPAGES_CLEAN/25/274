   Color
deficiencies, adaptation problems          
          1. Color deficiencies     
         8% of white U.S.
males are red/green blind     
         (less in other
races; white females: 0.5%)    these colors
appear medium-gray        
         *       
        Design for monochrome first,
and add  
      color as a            redundant 
device.            If
this is not (fully) possible, objects 
      should not only be    distinguished 
      by their amount of red or green.       
       
         
           2. Adaptation problems     
   Colors have different
wavelengths, ranging from red (610nm) to orange, yellow, 
green, blue and violett (380nm). Pupils must refocus when colors change.  
 
   *          When users' eyes must constantly switch between
objects of            different
color, avoid combinations of colors that differ strongly            in their
wavelengths (this hold particularly true for elderly users).
