Recent breakthroughs in sequencing technology, genomics, gene
expression profling, and compuational science have changed the face of modern
biology, transforming it into a largely information-based
science. This course introduces the state-of-the-art computational methods used
in studying modern biological systems. We study the principles of
algorithm design for biological datasets, analyze commonly used algorithms, and
apply them to solve real-life problems. The course serves as an introductory
course to the rapidly growing field of computational biology and
bioinformatics. 
Students involved in active research in biology or bioinformatics are encouraged to
bring their own research projects into the class, and develop them into 
course projects by teaming up with students from computer science. 


 





   Prerequisites 

  familiarity with multivariate calculus and probability theory
