	 A VIRTUAL TRY-ON SYSTEM FOR PRESCRIPTION EYEGLASSES   
	
	Qian Zhang, Yu Guo, Pierre-Yves Laffont, Tobias Martin, Markus Gross
	
	 CG&amp;A, 2016 
	[ Paper ][ Video ]
	 

	 
	We present a system for virtual try-on of prescription eyeglasses. Compared to existing virtual try-on systems, our approach simulates the refraction effects due to the corrective lens and takes into account reflections and shading.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 

	

	  
	 PHYSICALLY BASED VIDEO EDITING   
	
	Jean-Charles Bazin, Claudia Pluss, Yu Guo, Tobias Martin, Alec Jacobson, Markus Gross
	
	 CGF(Present on PG2016), 35:421–429, 2016 
	[ Paper ]
	 

	 
	We propose a framework that combines video editing and physics-based simulation. Our tool assists unskilled users in editing an input image or video while respecting the laws of physics and also leveraging the image content.
	 

 
 
 
 
 
 

	

	  
	 HOLISTIC AND FEATURAL PROCESSING FOR 2D AND 3D FACE RECOGNITION   
	
	Derric Eng, Belle Yick, Yu Guo, Hong Xu, Miriam Reiner, TJ Cham, SH Chen
	
	 APCV, Singapore, July 10-12, 2015 
	[ Poster ]
	 

	 
	We present an experiment to indicate that 3D faces would be recognised with shorter reaction time (RT) and greater accuracy than 2D faces during holistic and featural processing.
	 
		
 
 
 
 
 
 
	
	
	
	
	  
	 GPU ACCELERATED CBCT RECONSTRUCTION FROM FEW VIEWS WITH SART AND TV REGULARIZATION   
	
	Ping Liu, Lin Shi, Defeng Wang, Yu Guo, Jianying Li, Jing Qin, Pheng-Ann Heng
	
	 HPC-MICCAI, Nagoya, Japan, Sep.22-26, 2013 
	[ Paper ]
	 

	 
	We implemented an GPU-based algorithm by combining simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) and total variation (TV) regularization for the CBCT reconstruction from few views.
	 
		

 
 
 
 
 
 
		

		

	  
	 REAL-TIME HAND DETECTION BASED ON MULTI-STAGE HOG-SVM CLASSIFIER   
	
	Jiang Guo, Jun Cheng, Jianxin Pang, Yu Guo
	
	 ICIP, Melbourne, Australia, Sep.15-18, 2013 
	[ Paper ]
	 

	 
	We proposed a real-time hand detection method multi-stage classifier which combines several SVM classifies, each of which is trained to distinguish corresponding divisions of background and target.
	 
		
 
 
 
 
 
 
	
			
	
	  
	 A GPU-ACCELERATED FINITE ELEMENT SOLVER FOR SIMULATION OF SOFT-BODY DEFORMATION

	 ICIA, Yinchuan, China, Aug.26-28, 2013 
	[ Paper ]
	 

	 
	We presented a simulation method of soft body deformation with GPU implementation, which based on Delaunay Tetrahedralizition, Finite Element Method with friction-based collisional model.

	Yu Guo, Jing Qin
	
	 Journal of Integration Technology, Vol.2, No.2, Mar. 2013 
	[ Paper ]
	 

	 
	This paper presents a comprehensive survey on simulation of soft tissue deformation in virtual surgery. Including geometrically-based methods and physically-based methods, mesh-based model and meshless model.

	Yu Guo.
	
	 SIGGRAPH Asia, Poster, Singapore, Nov.28-Dec.1, 2012 
	[ Paper ]
	[ Poster ]
	 

	 
	We presented a contact model depending on constraints coupled with frictions which is called portable frictional contact model. 
	 

 
 
 
 
 
 
	
		
		
	  
	 A Master-Slave Robotic Simulator Based on GPUDirect
