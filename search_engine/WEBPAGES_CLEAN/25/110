Asynchronous adaptive task allocation
 
 
Sotirios Kentros
 

 
We present a randomized algorithm for asynchronous task allocation, also
known as the write-all or do-all problem. Our algorithm has work
complexity
of  O ( n  +  k  2 log 3  k )
with high probability, where  n  is the number of tasks
and  k  is the number of processes that participate in the
computation. This is the first adaptive solution for the write-all
problem that has work  n  plus some additive term which depends
only on the number of participating processes  k  and not the
size of the problem  n .
