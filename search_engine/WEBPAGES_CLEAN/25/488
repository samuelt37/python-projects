         AsterixDB becomes official Apache Software Foundation project</strong>
          
                    
 AsterixDB —the multi-school effort to build a highly scalable data management system that can store, index and manage semi-structured data—has officially become an Apache project, graduating from the Apache Incubator program of the  Apache Software Foundation  (ASF).

  
Now dubbed Apache AsterixDB, the system was co-developed by faculty, researchers, staff and students primarily at UC Irvine and UC Riverside, including Bren Chair and Computer Science Professor  Michael Carey</strong> and Computer Science Professor  Chen Li</strong>.

  
According to the project’s  website , since there is no open source parallel database systems (relational or otherwise) currently available to developers today, AsterixDB aims to fill this need. The project is intended to usher in a wave of Big Data Management Software (BDMS). It began as a large National Science Foundation  (NSF)-sponsored  project in 2009 to combine the best of the parallel database world, the Apache Hadoop world and the semi-structured data world. The team launched the first AsterixDB open source release in 2013 and it joined the  Apache Incubator  in 2015.

  
Some of the project’s key features include a flexible data model; distributed storage and transaction support; fast data ingestion; scalable, data-parallel query execution runtime; indexing for various data types; support of similarity queries; and a powerful declarative query language.

  
The ASF is a nonprofit organization that provides a foundation for open, collaborative software development projects by supplying hardware, communication and business infrastructure. The ASF Incubator helps new projects join the foundation, with graduation from the ASF Incubator being a highly selective and rigorous process.
