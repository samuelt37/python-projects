" Static and Dynamic Specification Slicing ," 
by Juei Chang and Debra J. Richardsoni in
 Proceedings of the Fourth Irvine Symposium on Software ,
pages 25-37, April 1994.

  Abstract  

A specification slice is a projection of a formal specification, which 
is simpler and potentially more comprehensible than the original 
specification. A static specification slice contains specifications 
that might restrict the value of a variable. A dynamic specification 
slice consists of specifications that actually affect the value of a 
variable along the sequence of operations performed. Dynamic specification 
slicing is a more powerful technique than static specification slicing, 
because dynamic slices are smaller than corresponding static slices. 
We discuss how dynamic specification slicing can be used in validating 
and debugging the specification and in creating test oracles for testing 
the implementation.
