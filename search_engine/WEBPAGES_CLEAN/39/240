    public class  StackADTThread 
    extends  ComponentThread 
   
StackADTThread class. 
Implements a stack abstract date type (ADT) in its own 
thread of control.  It accepts requests for modifying and accessing the 
stack from components in a C2 architecture below it, and notifies such 
components of its internal state changes.   
   StackADTThread's C2 Message Interface 
StackADTThread's methods should not be invoked directly in a C2
architecture.  Instead, the ADT's functionality is accessed via C2
requests. In response to those requests, the ADT emits notifications of
its internal state changes.

StackADTThread in an architecture.

  handle  
 
  public synchronized void handle( Request  r)
 
   Handles C2 requests received from components below 
StackADTThread in an architecture.  Manipulates the ADT and 
notifies components below of the results of operations on 
the stack and/or the state of the stack.
      Parameters: 
       r - C2 request.
        Overrides: 
        handle  in class  Component 
         
  handle  
 
  public synchronized void handle( Notification  n)
 
   Handles notifications received from components above.  Assumes that
StackADTThread is at the top of an architecture and
receives no notifications; hence, this is an empty method.
      Parameters: 
       n - C2 notification.
        Overrides: 
        handle  in class  Component
