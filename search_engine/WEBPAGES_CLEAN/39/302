 Intrinsic Versioning<body>

  Intrinsic Versioning  
      Servers create versions when a resource changes
 
  Not all resources MUST version
  Resources can be versioned even from HTTP/1.1
  Collections can be versioned
  Any change can cause a new version
       Resource support versioning-specific properties
 
     Some (discoverable) live properties may not cause versioning
