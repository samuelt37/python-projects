We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
 dynamic graphs  (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.
