   Monitoring the testing process  
 
We intend to study the relationship between the
Bayesian approach and software testing.  This
relationship is important not only since testing
should have significant implications for belief
and confidence levels, but also since a Bayesian
model should have ramifications for human judgment
and decision making during testing.  For example,
one important question in software testing is
``How much testing is enough?''.  This question
may be addressed by explicit modeling of uncertainty,
if sufficient testing is defined in terms of
levels of confidence in select system entities,
for example, its code modules.  As testing progresses,
confidence levels increase as long as test execution
is successful.  Testing is guided and monitored by
continuous update and comparison of confidence levels against
predefined thresholds.  Testers are notified and may take appropriate
action whenever thresholds are exceeded.  This approach may be
especially useful in safety-critical systems, where confidence
requirements and constraints
are often specified numerically.
With regard to CEquencer, we intend to enhance our Bayesian
model to include testing information - as it becomes available
at Beckman - and monitor the effects of the Bayesian approach
on testing decisions.
