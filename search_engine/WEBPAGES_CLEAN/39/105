Approximate Tree Decompositions of Planar Graphs in Linear Time
 
 Presenter: Jack Cheng 
  Frank Kammer and Torsten Tholey in SODA 2012  

 
Abstract: An algorithm will be presented, that given a planar graph G
with treewidth k on n vertices, computes a tree decomposition of width
O(k) in time O(nk^3log k).
