 A New Algorithm for Sampling CSP Solutions Uniformly at Random 

 Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter 

 
 Abstract  
The paper presents a method for generating solutions of a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) uniformly at random. The main idea is to express the
CSP as a factored probability distribution over its solutions and then generate
samples from this distribution using probabilistic sampling schemes. We suggest
parameterized sampling schemes that sample solutions from the output of a
generalized belief propagation algorithm. To speed up the rate at which random
solutions are generated, we augment our sampling algorithms with techniques
used successfully in the CSP literature to improve search such as conflict-directed
back-jumping and no-good learning. The motivation for this tasks comes from
hardware verification. Random test program generation for hardware verification
can be modeled and performed through CSP techniques, and is an application in
which uniform random solution sampling is required.
