3.4 Molecule Input and Output with Files 
 

 
In addition to standard in and standard out, OEChem's oemolstreams also
support reading from files.  To open a file, use the  open  method
with the required filename.  For input oemolstreams, if the file doesn't
exist the open fails and returns false, for output oemolstreams, the
output file is created if it didn't previously exist and overwritten if
it did.  If a null pointer,  (char*)0 , is passed as the filename
argument to open, an  oemolistream  will use  cin , and an
 oemolostream  will use
cout.  Much like regular file I/O, oemolstreams can be closed after use,
using the  close  member function.  oemolstreams are automatically
closed by their destructors.

  
    #include "oechem.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace OEChem;
using namespace OESystem;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  OEMol mol;
  oemolistream ims;
  oemolostream oms;

  if (ims.open("input.sdf"))
  {
    if (oms.open("output.mol2"))
    {
      while (ims &gt;&gt; mol)
        oms &lt;&lt; mol;
    }
    else cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Unable to create output.mol2" &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  else cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Unable to read input.sdf" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

One convenient feature of the  open  method of oemolstreams is that
they set the file format associated with stream from the file extension
of the filename used as an argument.  The example above converts the
file  input.sdf  in MDL file format into the file
 output.mol2  in Sybyl mol2 file format.  This behavior can be
overridden by calling  SetFormat  after the  open  but before
the first connection table is read or written to a stream.
