Switch Scheduling
 
Gwendoline Chien
 
 
A router is a box that switches internet packets from input links to ouput
links. The switch system must determine which inputs will transmit to
which outputs in a given time slot.  Mathematically, the
switching component of a router reduces to solving a bipartite
matching problem.  The router must match as many input links as
possible.  However, there is tradeoff between fairness and
throughput.  In this talk, I will give a brief overview of
switch scheduling problem and some algorithms that are being used.
