The way we engineer systems has to change if we are to make cost-effective 
use of many of the products and new technologies in the marketplace. These 
changes must address the relationship between system requirements definition, 
allocation of requirements to software, and selection of software 
technologies and off-the-shelf software packages. At the same time, we 
do not want to lose the benefit of the many lessons we have learned, the 
hard way, over the last 20-30 years about how to engineer systems that 
work and are supportable through their needed lifespans.

  

This talk discusses the impact of new technologies and the software 
marketplace on how systems engineering can and should be done. Classical 
systems engineering first understands customer's needs, and then translates 
these into system requirements, which are then allocated to hardware and 
software for design and implementation. However, COTS packages often offer 
much of the needed functionality at a small fraction of the cost of new 
development, but may include no easy way to add the remaining functionality 
needed. So the largest challenge of systems engineering so COTS can be used 
cost-effectively is how to define customer needs and system requirements 
so that available COTS packages can effectively be used in the system 
solution. Effective approaches change both systems engineering processes 
and the relationship between the systems builder and the customers, as well 
as the relationship between systems engineering and software engineering.

  

This session shares observations on the current state of the practice, as 
well as hard-learned lessons about what can work in the real world. In 
addition, participants will be asked to do exercises which give them a 
chance to make hands-on decisions of the type facing systems engineers 
today, with results illustrating the impacts on software engineering. 
(These exercises have no right or wrong answers, just a variety of 
possible consequences of the various choices). Participants should gain 
an appreciation of the key choices companies face today in how to approach 
systems engineering, and the circumstances under which they should choose 
specific alternatives.

  

 Biography: </strong>
Dorothy McKinney is currently employed by the Lockheed Martin 
Missiles and Space company as Mission Success Director for Ground Systems 
and Software. Previously, Dorothy worked at Lockheed Martin headquarters 
in Bethesda, Maryland as Director of Technical Operations and Processes 
in the Information &amp; Services Sector. This assignment followed one as 
Director of Software and Systems Processes in Lockheed Martin's C3I &amp; 
Systems Integration Sector (formerly Loral corporate). Dorothy began 
working for Lockheed Martin heritage companies in November, 1979. Her past 
assignments include helping to rescue a very large air traffic control 
program at Air Traffic Management in Rockville, Maryland. She started in 
the corporation as a systems engineer, later serving as Manager of Software 
Engineering, Director of Systems Engineering, and Executive Director of 
Engineering at Space and Range Systems in Sunnyvale, California. From 1985 
to 1994, Dorothy was also an Adjunct Professor in the graduate Engineering 
program at San Jose State University, teaching such subjects as Engineering 
Management and Software Project Management. Other industry experience 
included three years at ARGO Systems (a Boeing subsidiary), and nine years 
at SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute). Dorothy has an 
M.S. in Computer Engineering from Stanford University, and an M.B.A. from 
Pepperdine University. Dorothy is active in the International Council On 
System Engineering (INCOSE); has chaired national working groups and a 
technical committee, developed a train-the-trainer tutorial for the 1994 
Symposium, delivering tutorials to INCOSE chapters around the U.S., and 
participated in panels at INCOSE Symposia. She is now President-elect of 
the San Francisco Bay Area chapter.
