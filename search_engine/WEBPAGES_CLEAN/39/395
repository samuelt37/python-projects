Online Machine Scheduling -- A Brief Survey 
John Augustine 

 I will start by providing an introduction to online algorithms and
competitive analysis. I will then provide a brief survey of the online
machine scheduling problem by highlighting results from several papers
on it. I will also, time permitting, provide proof ideas and intuition
for a few results.
