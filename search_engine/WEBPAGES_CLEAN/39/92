        Hi, I'm Emily. Do you want to play with me?   
          
        C'mon I know you do.  
          
        Put up your dukes!   
          
        No, wait, I'm hungry!   
          
        ZZZzzzzzzz......  
          
        Yeah, pretty much I'm always in sombodys arms... 
        And that's the way it should be.  
      
   June 3, 2005:</strong> Wow! I'm a dad! Jeanette and I are so excited that our little girl is finally here! She's beautiful, of course! She has a similar hair color as mine, but with blond highlights. We can't really tell what color her eye's are, they're dark. But all that will likely change anyway. People say that she looks like me. My favorite thing about her is her nose! Every once in a while she'll look around and our eye's will meet. That is a wonderful experience!

    This is right after Emily was born. Jeanette, although tired, is happy to hold our little girl in her arms for the first time.

  What's this?... Fingers! Mmmmm...   
        
  Yawwwwn... I'm tired now!  
      
  Yep, time to take a nap after the hard job of being born.   
      
  I think that she knows that she's cute.
