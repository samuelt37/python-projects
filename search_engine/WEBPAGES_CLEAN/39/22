The  d K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
 d -dimensional tensor, describing the number of  d -tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any  d  ≥ 3, or for  d  = 2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).
