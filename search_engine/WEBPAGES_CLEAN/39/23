              Hours: TBA    Requirements: 

         Students are required to do a project in Artificial Intelligence.

         Final project: submit a report + code + demo + presentation.  

        Students will be required to work independently and be expected to acquire all the knowledge necessary for the project. They will have to fill in the necessary gaps in their background. 
          
          

          Grading: 
         
         Midterm report:  30%  Demo-presentation:  35%  Final report:  35%

		 Assignments and progress reports 
		For any assignment that you submit you should always state at the top of the report:
the team number, the names of team members and the project title.   
		Be sure to address the following questions:
		    How does the project build upon what is available in the literature and out there?
		   Important: What is the architecture of your project (different modules and who is doing what on the team)?
		   What AI algorithms will you be using?
		   what tools will you use, or have started to use?
		   Is there any data that you need to access?
		   How would you evaluate your project? What is the criteria for success?
		   What initial code have you started to develop?
		    

		  Past Projects 
		   Sudoku madness 
		
		   Rapier: a chess engine 
		   Freshman course counseling system 
		   Board game Go
