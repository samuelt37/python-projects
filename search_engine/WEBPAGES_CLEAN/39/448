			 Gliders in Life-Like Cellular Automata 

			 
				 This is an online database of gliders
				(moving patterns that remain bounded in size)
				in two dimensional cellular automaton rules such as
				 Conway's life.  

				 The following access methods are available: 

				   Form-based interface to select rules  
					  List of interesting evolution rules  
					 Lists of interesting gliders:
					   Smallest known gliders  
						  Biggest known gliders  
						  Slowest known gliders  
						  Gliders that move the farthest each period  
						  Gliders with the highest known periods  
						  Gliders that work in the most rules  
						  Gliders with unusual slopes  
					  
				  For more information, a standalone C version of the database,
				and pointers to search software for finding these patterns, see
				 my main cellular automaton page .
