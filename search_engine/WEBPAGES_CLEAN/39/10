I'm not sure I understand Dan Connolly's objection to standardizing
a version extension to URLs, other than that he is objecting to it.

It does underscore the fact that attaching version information to URLs
is going to be a battle, but a battle that I believe is well worth
fighting.  The question is just how innate is a version specifier in a
name at all?  To me (a version zealout), plenty.  The meta resource
information to which Dan refers to has to do with describing the _content_
of the resource, whereas the version information names the _container_
of the content.

Back to the nits...

I question the use of the syntax ";version={version_identifier}".  If
the word "version" is a stand-in for any number of meta identifiers,
then we dilute the strength of the argument that version information is
intrinsic to a URL, and we are in fact back Dan's argument that such
information belongs elsewhere.  On the other hand, if "version=" is a
constant string, let's strip it.

As for whether it's ";{version_identifier}" or ",{version_identifier}" --
I like the comma better, but only because I'm a UNIX weenie (";" is
special).

We need to stick to our guns: make a simple version extention to URLs
and make them standard.
