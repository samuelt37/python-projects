 Abstract  
Over the past twenty five years many backtracking algorithms have
been developed for constraint satisfaction problems. This survey describes
the basic backtrack search within the search space framework and then
presents a number of improvements developed in the past two decades,
including look-back methods such as backjumping, constraint recording,
backmarking, and look-ahead methods such as forward checking and dynamic variable ordering.
