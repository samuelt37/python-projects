   Happy endings for flip graphs.  
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:cs.CG/0610092 .  23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.   J. Computational Geometry  1 (1): 3–28, 2010 .
 
We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.
  
    Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction . 
D. Eppstein.  arXiv:0909.1866 .   J. Computational Geometry  2 (1): 144–182, 2011 .
 
Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a  Manhattan orbifold  and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L 1  plane.
  
    Steinitz theorems for orthogonal polyhedra . 
D. Eppstein and
E. Mumford.  arXiv:0912.0537 .  26th Eur. Worksh. Comp. Geom. , Dortmund, Germany, 2010.   26th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom.,  Snowbird, Utah, 2010, pp. 429–438 .   J. Computational Geometry  5 (1): 179–244, 2014 .
 
We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.
  
The journal version has the slightly different title "Steinitz theorems
for simple orthogonal polyhedra".

We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,
and partitions of those rectangles into smaller rectangles, to form
stylized visualizations of hierarchically subdivided geographic regions.
There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much
of the geographic information from the input we require the output to preserve.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

 J. Ku ,
 R. Lang , and
 T. Tachi .  arXiv:1507.01644 .   J. Computational Geometry  7 (1): 171–184, 2016 .
 
We give an exact characterization of the one-vertex origami folding
patterns that can be folded rigidly, without bending the parts of the
paper between the folds.
