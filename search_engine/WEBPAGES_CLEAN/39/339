  Instructor:    David G. Kay ,
406B Computer Science (   kay@uci.edu   )  
 
  Teaching assistant:   Jeff Ridenour 
(   jridenou@ics.uci.edu   )  
 
  Course goals:   As the middle course
in the first-year sequence, this course continues to focus on software design,
from a variety of approaches to modeling problems to the alternatives and
tradeoffs of data structure design and implementation to analyzing the performance
of those data structures and the associated algorithms.  We could call these
three themes design (How do we represent our problem so we can solve it
with software?), implementation (How do we decide which of the many alternatives
would be best for building this solution?), and communication (How can we
characterize our solution, especially its efficiency in consuming machine
resources under various conditions, in a way that other informaticians will
understand?).  
 
  Prerequisite concepts:   This course
expects Informatics 41 as a prerequisite.  
 
  Meeting place and times:   Lecture meets
six hours each week:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 to 12:20 in SSTR
101 and also from 2:00 to 3:20 in ELH 110. Discussion and lab section meets
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:00 to 3:50 in CS 192.  Most of your
lab work will be done in pairs, so you should plan to attend the scheduled
lab times to work with your partner.  
 
  Office hours:   You are welcome to drop
by my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something
else, I'll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.
 I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,
during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Wednesdays
from 11:30 to 12:20 and Thursdays from 12:45 to 1:15. Of course emergencies
may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  I'll
also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week.  The
quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described
below.  
 
  Questions and announcements:   You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the
ID    i42@uci.edu   .
 This goes to both of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above.  
 
 We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another
account, you should see    http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate 
  to update your UCInet account to forward
Email to your preferred account.  Don't let this slide; if you miss
official announcements, your grade could suffer.   
 
 This course's web page at    http://e3.uci.edu/05w/37000   
(which you can reach more mnemonically from the instructor's home page,
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay   );
official course Email is archived at    http://e3.uci.edu/05w/w3m3/37000   ;
and a course Note Board for student-to-student discussions is available
when you log on to   eee.uci.edu  
.  We don't use a news group for this course.  
 
  Textbook:   Data Structures and Algorithms
in Java, third edition,  by Goodrich and Tamassia.  This text has a web
site at    http://java.datastructures.net   .
 It contains a variety of useful information, but not the complete text
of the book.  
 
  Labs and lab hours:  Of course you will
need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday/Wednesday/Friday
lab hours.  Students in Informatics 42 may use any of the school's instructional
computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the
lab exclusively.  See    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab   
for lab hours and other information.   Note in particular that all ICS labs
are closed on university holidays.  
 
 Please remember that programming tasks always
take longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience
you have.  You must account for this as you plan your time; we cannot accept
busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete
assignments.  
 
  Programming language:   For most of the
work in this course, we will be using the current version of Java, Java
5.0 (which is sometimes also referred to as Java 1.5).  It provides enough
advantages over the previous version (Java 1.4.2) that we are requiring
it for all the Java programming this quarter.  The machines in our lab all
use this version.  If you wish to work from home, you can find instructions
about obtaining and installing it on Alex Thornton's page:    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics22/LabManual/SettingUpJava.html   .
   
 
  Other useful addresses:   We may distribute
some course materials at the Engineering Copy Center (ECC), in Engineering
Tower 203; the ECC is open 8-12 and 1-4:30, Monday through Friday.  
 
  Course structure:
    Homework and lab assignments , 
some on paper and some on line (25% of the course grade). All the assignments
will be available at    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/hw/   
.
  Class participation:   Based primarily on participating consistently
in the lab (10%).
  Weekly quizzes:   Given in lecture every Tuesday morning at 11:00
(30% together).
  One final exam:   On Tuesday, March 22, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
(35%).  
 
 We determine final grades neither on a formal
curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, Bs and Ds, etc.) nor on a fixed,
straight scale.  Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated,
but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been significantly lower;
this means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale
indicates.  If you're concerned, check with your TA or the instructor.
 The basic scale is:  grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases,
A+), 90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%-90%; grades in the C range,
70%-80%.  
 
 Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating
your work; go to him first for any questions about grading or scoring. 
If that does not resolve your question, then see the instructor.  The TA
and instructor will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we
must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the
item is returned; the course moves quickly, and we simply can't deal
with assignments long past.  
 
 We're required to say that in unusual circumstances,
these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to happen.  
 
  What to do this week to get started in Informatics
42:
  -- If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than
your UCInet account, redirect your mail at    http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phupdate   
.  
 
 -- On the Web, go to   checkmate.ics.uci.edu  ,
log in with your UCInet ID, choose the Winter 2005 quarter if it's not
already selected, click "Course Listing," click "Go"
next to Informatics 42, and then click "List me for this course."
 You'll submit some of your work electronically; this step is necessary
to set that up.
 
-- Get a lab printing key-card if you want to print things in the lab.  
 
  Good advice and helpful hints:   Make
every effort to attend the lectures; even more often than last quarter,
we will cover material that isn't directly in the textbooks.  It's
not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed, though
of course he will answer questions about it.  
 
 Attend your discussion and lab section, too;
assignments will be discussed and completed there, exams will be reviewed
there, and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture.
 Don't hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you. 
Since much of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends
on your consistent presence.  
 
 Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements.  
 
 Keep up with the reading; you'll need it
to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed
pages can quickly become a few chapters if you're not careful.  Our
text contains some details that won't be vital for your work.  You will
want to read the assigned sections early and quickly (for the main ideas,
not to memorize every detail); then you can ask your TA in section which
parts merit closer attention.  
 
 The assignments, like all technical specifications,
require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back
to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about
what's required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure
to read the assignment to get an idea of what's required.  
 
 Start each assignment early.  Programming always
takes longer to complete than you think it will, even if you have previous
programming experience.  By starting early, you'll have time to ask
in discussion section about problems you encounter.  
 
 If you find yourself having trouble or getting
behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  But  never  take the
shortcut of copying someone else's work and turning it in; the consequences
can be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic
honesty very seriously; for a more complete discussion, see the ICS departmental
web page covering academic honesty issues (   http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php   ).  
 
 Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the
shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),
we'll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  Finally,
turn in whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due
date.  In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further
on an assignment after the due date, but you must turn in whatever you have
when the official due date comes.
