 PROPPATCH Method - Implementation (Cont�d)<body>

  PROPPATCH Method - Implementation (Cont�d)  
      Request-URI
 
  The Request-URI is the resource on which the properties are defined.
  The current version of the specification requires that the �;DAV/� param be appended to all PROPPATCH requests, I am proposing that this restriction be removed. I further propose, that if PROPPATCH is executed on a property URL then the scope of the PROPPATCH is limited to that property.
