						 Real Talk is a multi-media toolkit for community engagement, transparency, and mobile governance.  The toolkit revolves around Stickets–vibrantly colored bio-degradable stickers–that a community can use to draw attention to any part of their physical environment.  A community-wide “Sticket Day” centered around neighborhood safety, for example, would visually highlight problem areas in a neighborhood, which with the help and guidance of the toolkit would allow local Real Talk “ambassadors” to document and geo-locate these places online using their phones.  Information that was held by the community thereby becomes simultaneously visible online and in the world, which enhances opportunities for engagement with local government and community stakeholders.

   Stickets’ design challenge: Transparency and Mobile Governance  
 Transparency in government is linked to better engagement, feelings of empowerment, and participation in local government by the community. According to a recent pew survey, low-income teenagers are more likely to access the internet through a smartphone than through a computer; adoption of smartphones among low-income (&gt;$30,000) Americans between the ages of 18-35 is roughly consistent with the national average. However, these same groups may be among the most underserved in terms of local government access and participation, particularly in the area of laws and services created to protect their rights. Your challenge is to design a mobile application or device to increase transparency of or access to government services to underserved individuals or communities.
